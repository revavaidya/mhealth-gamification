I’ve already sent them 2 cancellation emails with no response. And even if you delete the app it doesn’t cancel your auto subscription. So if you just want to try it to see how it goes, it’s very difficult to get out before the trial period ends. I started trying to cancel it just after two days because I wasn’t thrilled with the app. And I still haven’t been able to cancel it. No customer support on social. No recourse if they don’t answer your email to cancel. Really disappointed with this app.I downloaded this app because of a video on social media that looked impressive and said the app was free. After filling out the initial 5-10 minute survey, I found out the app was NOT free, and didn’t even have a free version. 

Whatever, maybe there was an update since the video I saw was made? I decided to give it another chance and tried it anyways. I did the first workout, felt pretty great, and felt pretty proud of myself. But because of my heart rate, in the post-workout summary the app said “You’re not doing any activity.” 

I’m on beta blockers. Don’t need to be shamed for it. :(I truly liked the animated video commercial on my social media feed, so I downloaded the app.  I filled out all the information and it gave me options to pay. I picked the one month version and hit start for my program. It was nothing like the video I saw. Originally I picked to do my work out on a bed and the workout they gave me was all on the floor. I would like my money back.Do not purchase the full version! I purchased thinking it would be fun – seeing the videos posted on all social media.

Ive followed everything and even exceeding the activity and calorie goals each day. I gained not only weight but inches indicating that it was not just water weight or muscle weight. I was loosing weight at a steady pace before starting the app.  This leads me to believe that the estimated time they gave me to reach my goal weight is not accurate. 

Like other reviewers i was also charged immediately and would have liked a trial period. I choose three months since i wouldnt be able to afford a year subscription and my target weight was supposedly going to be reached within the three month time frame. 

I also use my apple watch and fitness apps to keep track of daily steps and calories burned. My watch and apps are very similar but the justfit app is way off from both forcing me to work even harder to burn calories to reach my goals when my iwatch says ive already doubled it though the step count on justfit is a few thousand steps ahead of my watch and fitness apps. 

I do love the exercises so its a shame the rest of the app doesnt live up to my expectations and sets unrealistic time frames for weight loss.As a person in recovery for an eating disorder, i was already wary of the questions i would be asked to begin - i wasn’t prepared to be disgusted by the questions though. 
the goal of working out can just be to have fun and enjoy it. the questions about goals were centered around changing my body and/or my weight instead of just because it could be fun? something new to try? then to have a BMI chart when BMI has been proven to be outdated, inaccurate and harmful. this entire app fuels the toxic diet culture. i hope whoever thought of this gets the day they deserve.They lure you in with “a completely Free” workout app. I can’t believe I fell for it again. After they took my bio data (age, gender, weight, fitness goals, current fitness level) then they slap you in the face.
It’s Free for 7-days, then you gotta pay.  Oh, and you can’t opt out and just choose Free in the beginning. They are already asking you at this point to choose a payment plan and payment info.
If there was a way to sue for false advertising I would.Did search for Free fitness application for some instruction on basic beginner exercises for seniors.  As soon as you get past some initial body and fitness items, a screen comes up for membership plans for 1 month, annual, etc. with the pricing.  Basically, all they determined is that I’m old and out-of-shape…already knew that without a payment or completing a fitness and goals quiz.  Don’t waste your time on the not free, app.At first the app was absolutely amazing. The workouts are perfect! But on the fourth day, you have no choice but to buy premium if you want to continue. This is very misleading. I was so excited to continue my workouts and reach my goals. Now I have to just repeat the first three workouts. This is a scam, please work on making changes so no one has to experience the same thing I did.Goes through all this detailed personalization, and gets your goals in mind, and sets a really awesome plan… aaand then after day 3 you have to pay to use the program. You can still see your tuned workout for the next month  though, so I’ll probably just write it down and delete the app.",0,Not worth the price.

A good motivator to have a new workout each day ready for me so I don’t have to think.
Cons: My plan is extremely redundant and comically simple. They ask for your weight loss goals when you sign up and claim that you will get to your goal weight by a certain date. How? Magically? They offer zero dietary advice. I can not skip ahead or do two workouts of my plan in one day. The next day is locked. There are plenty of other supplemental workouts available. One says “if you’re having trouble losing weight try this”- should be a picture of a salad underneath it because no amount of exercise without a diet change will get you there.
If you are a total newbie to exercise, this could be a good start for you. But it is incredibly misleading to say that you will lose weight. You may tone up a bit but weight loss comes with consistently eating a well balanced low calorie healthy diet! Good luck!Deleted this app off my phone before I even began utilizing it for workouts. It’s set up like a lot like click bait: tries to get you hyped and eager with a series of questions and statements and then drops the “well you can’t have our personalized approach unless you pay.” Thank you for motivating me to make my own personalized weight loss schedule. It’s quite possible to do with a few check lists, a Fitbit, and some hand picked videos found online. Aside from the predictable “gimmie your money” gimmicks, I guess it could be a great app for someone who doesn’t have the time or motivation to tailor their own weight loss goals and is willing to pay, which is why I give it 3 stars.",0,Not for weight lossNags you to pay,GiselelookalikeShepherd117,JustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout Fit,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,321,has_goals,23

In between each workout they give you breaks and it also shows you how to do the next workout you are about to do. And the best part is that they provide music for each workout so it’s not boring. I definitely recommend this app for you if you want to get in shape, stay healthy, or lose weight!IT works good but I want to know where I can change the way I want to have the body I’m aiming to get! Either way it’s awesome but also what does consolidation mean? Does it mean like when you have the body you want or?? Anyways I love it so far not trying to slack or be slow I have my goals for next school semester to look good and feel good for myself of course! But you know it’s nice to have a glow up once and a while🤭🤭Anyways the app it great thanks devs for working hard to make this great app!🤍🤭🤭I love this workout app. I entered my information and my goals and the app customized my daily workouts. I love that I can re-evaluate after each 28 day program. I don’t do well at the gym. I get intimidated. But doing this program consistently, I am seeing results. My stomach is flatter, my arms are stronger, and my stamina has increased. I’ve already recommended this to several people.This is great for kids adults and elderly who’s looking to lose weight. It keeps you active and healthy and you set goals for yourself. It will ask you a bunch of questions at the being  and then you attempt the workout! Amazing app recommend for all ages.My very first workout with JustFit was awesome! I’ve only done 1 so far and love it! I love how it ask you questions about what your goals are and about you specifically so it can help you even better! Can’t wait to see my progress with this app! 100% recommend!It was actually a good workout it got me breathing hard and they also ask for your goals and what you want to achieve and they give you a time time line and you do a workout every and you can even do it on your bedToday is my first day trying out this fitness program , I am excited about it and I am looking forward for excellent results . I am breathless right now but with confidence and consistency I will achieve my goals ,There are hundreds of DIY workouts on the cyber highway. This app is the very best at assessing the target, creating achievable goals, and setting you “in motion” to conquer your mutually established plan of action. Go for it !! BECAUSE YOU CAN !! It’s a win win!!I didn’t think this app would help but I am  shocked i met my goals and in working out just how I like it thanks to this app :)Love This App So much it keeps me motivated To keep Going To Reach My Goals and just feel amazing everyday.I love this app the easiest workout app  the goals are simple I have lost 9 lbs in my week trial!it was good app to lose weight and It made me get to my goals",1,RecommendWorks good but I have a questionGetting fit in my fiftiesBest fitness app ever!🤩First ImpressionsReally goodGet fitEasy does it!Use this app2nd Step In Life To Start Feeling GoodGreat app!review,Harpie16kokolovesJustfitcolechuffSadie165Ash the desinernya4762992563JemtrinbagomileybrandsAubriana vlove thos freaking gameAzurelee1990lkdgeva ban,JustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout FitJustFit Lazy Workout Fit,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,599,has_goals,23

I was excited that it asked me extensive questions regarding my preferences for working out, including type (chair vs bed vs yoga mat), and history of injuries. I requested a low impact, 15 to 20 minutes, chair workout, and what I got instead was a yoga mat program that on the first day starts out with jogging in place and jumping jacks, and soon was up to 30 to 40 minutes. When I tried to adjust the plan, there is simply no way to do it.

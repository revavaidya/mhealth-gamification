The concept is fine, but I won't be using the app because:

1) these colors are hideously bright and clash with each other enough to make reading difficult. They give me a headache when I try to use the app for more than a few seconds.

2) What's with all the wasted white space? It's pointless to view a schedule when you can only see a few classes at a time and the whole screen is wasted with enormous and pointless icons. More functionality. Less attempt at being cool.

3) It bugs you CONSTANTLY for feedback. Honestly, it asked me to rate it within a minute of having installed it. I clicked ""later"". Later turned out to be five minutes later. I'm now rating it after having been asked to rate it three times.

4) It also bugs you constantly to make suggestions. I had difficulty even booking a class at my regular yoga place because it kept trying to recommend other studios to me. I'm not sure my home yoga studio will be thrilled to hear that.

Additionally, this requires you to create a login in addition to the one you use on the website already. It's a minor inconvenience, but it proved indicative of their overall inability to construct a quality app.When it works it’s great but lately the app has a bug where I can see a studios classes on the desktop version and even in the my schedule section of the app but not when I go to book a class in the app itself. It says no classes found. This happens for multiple studios! Tried to get help for this problem but all support seems to be for the businesses, not the end users. NOT COOL MINDBODY!  You forced me to provide this feedback here, along with a one star review and to uninstall your now worthless app. Fix this bug!!!I’ve trying to use this app for my gym for over 7 months.  Rarely am I able to book or reschedule my classes via the app.  My class schedule is rarely available to review.  There’s no where to give feedback although I got an email telling to use the app to give feedback for a quicker response.  If it’s in the app, then the app is not user friendly. The typically it’s states try again later for your business schedule.  Yet it’s available on the web.  It’s a very frustrating app to use.This app continues to deteriorate.   Used to sync with calendar without issues.   I have to manually sync many times to get appointments to transfer.   Newest issue- when I open the app to check schedule, it shuts down.   Three years ago, I had no issues.   I have an iPhone 11.  Any feedback as to why all the issues is appreciated.   BTW - dors the same thing on my IPad.App no longer works. It takes me about 10 minutes to sign up for 3 classes at the same studio. The app continuously freezes and remains that way. I used to love the convenience of this app. If you can’t get this fixed, I’m going to complain to the studio and recommend that they find a new booking service. Your app used to be perfect. Now it’s a huge PITA.So tired of the app crashing and freezing. It’s continuous.   I’ve been trying to schedule 3 classes for this week and so far I’ve gotten one booked in the last 10 minutes.  The app would be convenient but I don’t have time to deal with the terrible performance issues.  Please get it fixed!There is a terrible bug in the UI that displays some classes as free when they are NOT free. You need to continuously click through to see the price.

I think I started using this app around 2014, and even though the options were limited then, the businesses MINDBODY has drawn have always been worth a visit—a unique experience with a wide range of alternative, and traditional, fitness and wellness options. MINDBODY appears to be a business that attracts businesses of a similar likeness in striving to elevate the customer experience. 

Perhaps there are other apps out there, like this, that allow you to personalize your interaction with the fitness and wellness centers in your area, but MINDBODY has continuously proven to this user that they are a pioneer in creating accessibility and a feeling of welcome to this industry.

I am a true novice and I knew after 5 days into an introductory offer, I found a home.  The instructors are professional, and their knowledge of the body, mind and spiritual connections are second to none. They weave the breathing techniques, instructional poses and the physiology simultaneously.  
     So far I experienced 3 different instructors.  Margo in particular reads a quote and paces her direction in a clear, articulate calming voice and in a way thats not intimidating.  She encourages us  and pushes our limits at the same time.  Proudly I have had 21 classes and no 2 have been remotely the same. Any concerns or anxiety that you bring to the class are left at the door.  I guarantee that your body, mind and spirit are significantly relaxed and improved before you exit the studio.  Cannot wait for my next class.

1. Signs into my class for me by using my GPS to know I’m at the location.

2. Connects to my Fitbit and figures out the amount of calories I burned SPECIFICALLY IN THAT CLASS. 

I didn’t even know either of these technologies existed until now!!!

Also, I read past reviews and the developers of this app are EXTREMELY responsive to market desires. It’s amazing how features people were asking for less than a year ago have already been implemented! This company has amazing employees :)

The App Store should allow for outdated low-ratings requesting updates, that have now been implemented, to be deleted because these old ratings are making its score inaccurate for the app it is today.Useful to find and book workout classes with nice tech integration of FitBit and other fitness tracking devices. The only downside is there aren’t many businesses outside workout providers and would be nice to more massage, acupuncture and other wellness options.I love being able to use this app as I look for just the right yoga class and time. Makes tracking multiple yoga studios a breeze!!This ap has been wonderful! It allows me to see all kinds of opportunities and specials.

If I try to search again, it won’t even attempt to pull up the studio. Same thing happens when I click on a studio from my search history - brings me to the default list. I have to either close out of the app, or click on the classes tab and play around with date and time before switching back to the businesses tab to see if there’s any luck.

Using the share feature to send a studio or class to friends - the link they get leads them to the homepage. What’s the point?

How in all these years has MindBody not created a filter for free classes? Especially now that studios are offering free sign ups as a way to do Zoom classes in light of the quarantine. We shouldn’t have to scroll through every studio’s schedule to see what’s up.

It makes me wonder if the developers and their staff even use their own app because these problems have been persistent for years.I liked this app more until the new version updated. Why did you guys take a way the history option of my schedule? I want to be able to look back at specific classes that I’ve taken and see which dates/ instructors etc Now it just re-routes you to my profile which only contained the total number of classes taken.Two stars only because one star is reserved for apps that don’t open. Has really gone downhill. You can’t even view your visit history in the app anymore.

But the last couple of days, every time I open it and want to view the college’s or even my schedule, it says there is nothing there. Even though I have booked things and have a history on the app itself. In order to get my history back and see my classes, I have to delete the app off my phone and reinstall it. 

That’s my only big problem. Otherwise it is a great app.I really loved this app, until the “updated” design now makes it harder on the eyes to find anything, especially the classes list schedule. Also the class history is harder to read too. It’s used to look more like a calendar view and it was easier to review dates attended and so on. 

In general now there is so much white space and such a small font. It is just so hard to read on mobile devices. 

Functionality rocks but UI will keep me away. Please go back!Update: some of problems have been fixed. At least I can see my appointments & favorites again 

Had to delete it after
Last update. Nothing worked and all my history & favorites were gone. Get it right next timeWith the update to the app I can no longer see my class history. This is important to me and has negatively impacted my experience using the app. Other workout apps that I have allow me to view my class history",1,ShidiflurinDavidDPhoenixOh really??D_Turtle,Having a few issuesUI Downgrade?Bad updateCan’t see class history?,"{'id': 16864695, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you for your feedback!

In general it is a very helpful app.  Since the last major update, I have found it less useable than it was previously.  The formatting is less clear in my opinion; it was previously very clear to see upcoming appointments, and previous history.  The new version has these functions, but there are subtitle differences that make them, among other things, less straightforward.  I would prefer an evolution of the previous format.I find it frustrating that there’s no easy way to see my history of classes or activity- I have no record of when I cancel classes so cannot contest an unjust late fee.",0,LookWithinmlbczsy,"Helpful app, preferred previous layoutLacks history breakdown","{'id': 12552453, 'body': 'Hi, we appreciate the feedback!

I’ve really gotten into yoga and it’s become such a huge part of my life. The MINDBODY App makes it so easy for me to enjoy my favorite new “hobby” — way of life? I’ve never not been able to do what I wanted to do, and do it easily! It’s totally intuitive to use, and you can do everything!!: browse schedules, research types of classes, read reviews, book and buy classes, cancel easily if necessary, purchase and use passes, packs, and packages — even research your visit history and what classes and teachers you’ve had. It’s all a smooth, seamless experience. Remarkable! Thanks!Although initially I was a little hesitant to download and use the app, as it just seemed like one more thing on my phone, I'm really glad that I have it now. The app makes it really easy to discover new studios and deals. It's also nice to be able to view your upcoming schedule, especially if you train at multiple places. It's also kind of cool to see your class history, especially if you have a teacher you would like but later can't remember his or her name.This app is so great to keep track of all my yoga appointments. I can cancel very easy if my schedule changes I could review my history on what I took before and I could look at what I have planned. If you enjoy your yoga class you can even write a review which is really nice so they know what you like and don’t like.I enjoy using the app to book my hot yoga classes. I can see the accurate dates, times, descriptions, and even updates of a class is cancelled. Also great way to keep a history of when you went to class. Wish availability of discounts were available but you can always call the studio.I love that it keeps track of the classes I have taken . I can travel out of town and find classes nearby through mind and body. Yes and it will add the class to my history of past classes. Oh and you can book and pay for classes in the app. I really utilize the mind body app in every way.It’s easy and accurate both for my home studio and when I travel.  It lets me double check to make sure my fav teacher is still teaching before I get in my car.  I also love that I can view my history!",1,Methere58poppopboatA dreyetBeaJuicerb201396jsaltzman,Great app!!!I love it!Great app to keep trackConvenient way to bookLove tracks my classesObsessed with this app,"{'id': 12655145, 'body': 'Thank you very much for your 5-star review!!!', 'modified': '2019-12-30T22:47:09Z'}{'id': 3116627, 'body': 'Thanks for downloading our app!

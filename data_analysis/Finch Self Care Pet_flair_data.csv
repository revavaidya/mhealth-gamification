5,pos,2023-06-06 08:15:41,0,"I started using this app when I was in a dark place in my life— I was highly unmotivated, I wasn’t that happy of a person… but Finch has definitely helped with a lot of this. 

This app has helped give me motivation to do many different tasks in a day, whether they were major or minor because I would want to get new clothes for my bird (Astro) or get him new furniture. 

And plus, the game is so cute overall. Opening the app always gives me a little smile. 

One thing though— maybe there should be another way to earn gems besides completing tasks? Because each individual task only gives you about 3-5 gems, and it takes multiple days to unlock gems for when you cleared a certain number of journey days. Personally, I think more minor tasks such as making your bed could be about 10 gems, and more major tasks such as vacuum cleaning your room could be 15-20.

Maybe there could be another event system, like a leaderboard where you can get gems depending on how many goals you’ve achieved. Or, it could be like this but with friends— the friend with the most number of goals cleared can earn a number of gems.

Otherwise, this game is so adorable and I can’t wait to grow Astro. Thank you!",0,Marzuuli,The Cutest!,Finch Self Care Pet,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,224,has_leaderboard,1

At first I was a little confused and didn’t really care about the goals but the more I used it and the more my finch grew it became part of my schedule. Now I check the app around 30 times a day to say hi to friends or complete challenges or just check in with my finch, Freckles. One thing I thought might be cute, is if there could be a chat feature when sending Good Vibes. Now, this may be stupid and maybe it’ll just be another platform for cyber bullying but maybe y’all could tinker with that idea. Another thing I thought is if you have friends on finch we could be able to set up play dates between the finches, in which you could get one play date a week or a day or something and your finch could travel to where the other finch is and have a “play date”. It would be the same as adventures in where you would have to wait for a certain amount of time then pick your finch up and collect gems. I don’t know, but I thought it might be cute!

I’ve always been wary with self care apps as they usually are just journaling and breathing and you have to pay a ton of money for! I got finch almost a year ago and it has been the best self care app and mental health app I’ve ever used. There are 2 different “versions” of the app. One is the free one, I used that for a couple of weeks to make sure I liked it and there is 0 ads even in the free version. The free version is really good and about the same experience as the plus version. Once I knew I loved the app and was committed to using it I did the plus subscription and it gave me more journaling options, quizzes, different daily challenges and more outfit choices along with more customization options for my finch named Franklin. For me it is pretty affordable especially with how much it has helped. If you can’t afford it there is also a gaurdianship program where people can become gaurdians and sponsor someone’s subscription and it’s given out at random! It has helped me so much with my daily anxiety and helps me journal and learn about my feelings while still being fun! I 100% recommend!This app is so amazing. First off I would like to say I think it’s very cool that the time you can spend on the app is pretty minimal, once you complete certain tasks, so you aren’t distracted by it all day like other “games”. That being said, it does really help set a positive tone for your day through motivational quotes. It challenges you to complete “simple” goals, which can sometimes trigger a spree of productivity— and at the very least, you can be proud to have accomplished the “small things”, that maybe you weren’t having the easiest time with. It acknowledges that sometimes we do not even think we can get out of bed, and it provides support, and motivation related to self-care. The collection of reflections are thought provoking, and help regulate emotions and keep grounded without being irrational even on a bad day. And on bad days, they encourage you to vent. First Aid feature is incredibly important and helpful, teaching ways to overcome anxiety, panic, etc. Anyways, the app is totally worth it even in the free version, but I’ve tried out the premium version and I must say it is absolutely worth the money. Oh and I’m an adult but I do enjoy decorating my nest, & changing up my finch’s appearance. Lol it’s so cute. Get this app.Using Finch has been so good for my mental health! We all know what the right things are to do but it’s hard to motivate and care enough to do it for myself; however when doing those things help someone else, it becomes a lot more impactful! That’s what Finch allows you to do. Gives motivation to take care of yourself to help your baby bird grow and be healthy. Along the way, the bird also learns lessons, which is you teaching them. You can respond differently and the choice you choose  ends up growing ur bird in extroversion, logic, security, compassion, etc. this has been such a helpful feature because it helps me understand how my thoughts are frames that influence my attitude. It showcases how negatively I’m thinking. I don’t want my child to be influenced by my negativity, so it challenges me to grow and reframe my thoughts so that I and my Finch can be more successful and healthy. I love it!! I know I am an all around healthier person because of this app and I’m really grateful for it! It also allows you to set reminders to connect with your friends which I love. Plus it pops up positive thoughts to your phone throughout the day like “I believe in you!” So sweet! Can’t recommend enough.Finch is a great app that both helps your complete goals and makes you feel good about them. I love the idea that completing your goals help your little friend to grow. Mine is Ivy, and she’s a little cutie. I love that even if you miss a day or two, or a few, that the app doesn’t make you feel guilty. They simply say they missed you and are happy to have you back and you pick up where you left off. It’s completely free besides an expansion to get extra goals but it’s not necessary and doesn’t hinder your experience. The devs are simply the best. I’ve tried many self care apps and games but this is the one i’ve never deleted and actually work with. I’ve down something I never do, and suggested this app to multiple other people. This got away from me, but this app is amazing and I needed to leave a review

Can’t wait to any future updates. I also love the seasonal challenges, seeing as seasonal depression is real and it allows you to try and push yourself for the rewards at the end of the month!I don’t know if I’ve ever written an app review but I will write a million for this sweet app. I have always struggled with mental health and keeping goals until this app. I even always brush my teeth twice a day even when I’m depressed and tired. Y’all have created magic!! Haha :)

I had a stroke a handful of years ago in my late 20s which has left me a different person. This app has helped me take slow mindful steps each day towards achievable goals. My birb really does feel like a best friend, much like my tamagotchi did back in the day haha, but there’s no stress in the upkeep. It’s the first thing I do when I wake up and the last thing before I go to sleep. The new reward challenges are so cute and fun and give me another reason to show up daily. My pet having a pet??? Cmon how could it get any better? I love it so much. 

The free version offers so much and I truly hope they keep it that way!! The paid version is reasonable but unfortunately is out of my pricing limit right now. Anyways. I love this app and I am so so grateful to have found it! Now when can I do a build a birb and get my own real life plushy?? ;) 

Thank you with all my being to the developers, you’ve seriously given me a new lease on life!This app is so great. It won't work for everyone, but for those it does work for it's really helpful and overall fun. It's a cute design and has little monthly challenges that make me want to do my tasks for the little prizes. The overall concept is so adorable and I love my little birb, and the little shops and stuff are adorable as well as the different locations. It's helped me a lot and I've recommended it to multiple friends and would do it again. The monthly finch plus raffles are also amazing, I entered once and won, and when it ran out the finch team understood I couldn't buy a plan and extended the free one. Thank you so much to all the finch team and sponsors and everyone reading this do try the app it's worth your time!!I’ve struggled with many things such as setting goals for myself and making myself feel worse about not completing them or why I’m so disorganized. Finch has been a huge help and thus actually helped me emotionally and mentally. It’s such a positive reinforcement and I’m so thankful for the devs on making this app. I love my little bird and although it is a fictional being I feel as though I want my little bird to be proud of my growth. I can set my to do list for the upcoming days, I never miss a day without checking on my little birdie so it keeps me in check. Even with feeling down and depressed sometimes, I can track how often and what I can do to overdose little challenges at a time to improve myself. Great app guys!Truly, I’ve never felt compelled to review an app, ever, but I think that Finch is just terrific. As someone who has mental health challenges and ADHD, performing self-care tasks has been such a struggle for me. I’ve downloaded all of the meditation apps, tried journaling, and bought dozens of fancy planners. I’ve never completed my to-do lists. I’ve never been one to practice grounding and breathing techniques. Finch has changed all of this for me. If you need support with executive functioning, download Finch!

There are so many helpful activities and tools on the app. There are prompts for writing and mindfulness. There are accessible movement activities and exercises. I appreciate that no daily goal is too small and there is always room for growth. Checking off a task is satisfying and fun, because you earn more rewards for your bird! 

I also really admire how accessible the app is, cost-wise. There is a paid version of the app, but the free version is incredibly detailed and has lots of information/activities AND there are zero ads on the app. 

Major kudos to the team behind Finch. I can’t say enough positive things about this app!I really like the Finch app because it helps to get my mindset in a positive path for the day.  It gently encourages me to get a positive vibe started by help little Finch over his hurdles & daily challenges.  Since I started Finch, I find myself not being upset, I’m more relaxed because I put down my conscious intentions on virtual paper (like a commitment) to help me have a better day. Don’t get me wrong, I still have a negative thought here and there but they are getting less and less because I have made a commitment to myself to live a better life in the moment, being present and appreciating all that I have and not being consumed with office drama and life’s challenges. I really like Finch.  Very helpful to change my mindset.  Thank you 👍I love this app. The idea of motivating self-care by doubling it as care for a little pet is genius for people like me, who struggle to see the worth in looking after ourselves. The art is cute, the goals are mini-challenges, but more than doable, and the sheer variety and expanse of features available are wonderful. 
I have only one request: if the developers could add a gifting mechanic, that would be fantastic. Being able to send your little bird out to visit your friends is great, but I think we could expand on that and allow our birds to take our friends items we bought for them, too. 
Other than that, this service is perfect. Keep up the good work.Ok I’m gonna preface this by saying that this is just my own experience as a person with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I will say that I have the paid version which can be cost prohibitive for some people but there are free paid accounts given away every month and at the time of me writing this about half of all users who don’t have the paid version have been gifted it. 

I find this app very helpful. I enjoy the bird and the micropets and the monthly challenges. Some people dislike having to maintain streaks for rewards but I find it motivating. I know some people find that anxiety producing so be aware of that. 

The main reason for my rating is that this app was able to make me build and stick to (for over a year now!!!) a morning routine that sets me up for success for the day. 

Being able to plan out my day in advance and having no guilt or shame around skipping/not completing a goal is a huge win for me too. 

Finally their intentional inclusion of disabled people and queer people in the accessories is something I really appreciate.This app is super great because it challenges me to take care of my self while also letting me connect and support my friends. Me and lots of my friends have gotten it and we all enjoy making our birds unique and supporting each other. There is sometimes a small glitch where it shows my bird wearing something during an adventure that my bird isn’t wearing and that I don’t even own. It will also sometimes show my bird not wearing clothes at all when he is visiting friends. Other than that this app is really creative and fun.I wish I hadn’t given other apps five stars because I want this one to get the highest rating I’ve ever given. It solves a lot of the challenges I’ve run into with other similarly themed apps. I appreciate that it doesn’t punish me for missed days and that it allows me to link it to friends without creating social pressure. Being customizable but offering loads of options to get started helps me think about what would actually help me, and it regularly makes me laugh with quirky little bird nonsense.",0,Kiarafb2019_YaGirlTElizaAtetLele0#Bekah & Opalsmilies:))xovli.ypytMCBSLPOncPharmTechDre0118999leenieo7KittyCat&AllThatliz&lani,"Helped me recover!LOVEFinch is Awesome!I truly do love this appMy favorite appLiterally amazingMy little birb and meFantastic appFinchIncredible app, but -Very helpful for meThis app is super greatThe cutest and most motivating care app I’ve encountered",Finch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care Pet,0,13,0,0,0,1,1,5,0,0,2245,has_challenges,14

Maybe it’s also because I love to write & I'm also clearing a lot of clutter this Spring - stirring up memories as well as dust - but I enjoy the questions asked & the way my responses are saved. The daily reminders are helpful. The reminder to slow down at bedtime with a selection of sounds of water (available all day) or meditation or breathing exercises are built right in. I also enjoy the aspect of earning points that can be spent to contribute to the story - it’s playful. I’m not done exploring all the possibilities. Full disclosure: I am a retired family physician who paid attention to a range of wellness & mental health issues - I could see myself suggesting this app as an adjunct to other remedies & therapies - possibly as a way for some to encourage basic self-care habits &/or to keep  track of their medications & appointments if it worked for them.
It won’t appeal to everyone (what does?) but I’m pretty sure that the built in whimsy would have cheered me when I had some grim times.I saw this game as an ad on either Study Bunny or Habit Rabbit, both apps I recommend to those who struggle taking care of themselves and their daily responsibilities. Finch helps me so much! While it doesn't offer professional advice like a therapist would, I find that it allows almost an identical venting space that a therapist would, just with no response. I have PTSD and severe depression and anxiety, every single prompt I write my complete heart out into for as much points as possible and in the end I feel proud of myself for writing so much. You don't think that writing your thoughts out will do much since you're repeating those words in your head all the time, but it's like unraveling some knotted strings in your brain. You just start so sort of find yourself through your vent writing. It is very easy to look at and the outfits are cute, nothing makes you feel pressured to do anything, the stretch and breathing exercises have also become a daily goal for me because they're so helpful when I need to recharge. I really recommend this app!!I have ADHD and social anxiety and I have been using Finch for a few weeks to help with them. I’ve found so much comfort in this app. It’s not boring to look at, which is a major problem for me and other self-help apps. I also have large broken up into smaller little goals that are much easier to achieve. And, I can read my daily reflections in the form of bullet points instead of everything being in one long essay. On top of everything else, I get to take care of an adorable little bird whenever I take care of myself.
Now, I’m not so good with features unless they’re straight-up handed to me. I also have a lot of goals throughout the day and I want to be able to list them chronologically. For instance, my morning goals be at the top, and my nightly ones at the very end. I’m not sure if I’m able to do that already, which is possible and I just haven’t figured it out yet, but if not, I think it’d be beneficial to people such as myself. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. =)Finch is so helpful for self care, and it's deceptively cute!! Some days I log on just to take care of my little bird, then end up taking care of myself too. The app has guided breathing exercises, soundscapes, stretches and exercises, goal trackers, and lots of journaling prompts. Doing things earns points for your bird to go on adventures and grow up from an egg to an adult. You can also earn coins to spend on things like new outfits and decorating your bird's room. Plus! There are seasonal prizes, like themed decor and clothes, and you can even earn little pets for your bird!! There's also a social element, where you can send your bird over to visit your friend's birds. The developers have created such a fun, well-balanced app, and it's obvious a lot of love has gone into this. It feels fun and game-y, but not like you have to pay to play like a lot of gameified apps. Both the paid and free version are fun and helpful. You really can't go wrong trying it out!! I recommend this to anyone who wishes self care could be fun.I love Finch so much!! Honestly, I thought I was going to delete it after I got it, but NO!! It’s so fun for just relaxing. When you download it, and open the app you get an egg and get to choose the name, and gender of your Finch, (They even have “they/them” options!) After you’ve chosen your little friend, you can write how your feeling, memories, and other things. Finch has a “First Aid” button that has things that may help with your anxiety, panic attacks, breathing, and so much more! There are soundscapes for those who enjoy them. Your Finch goes on adventures to find new things out in the world, but you’ll need energy points in order to do this. You can get these energy points by writing, and doing tasks in the game. You can buy clothes and accessories to personalize your Finch with crystals you can get in game! Also, how could I forget that you can invite your friends and interact with them in tree town! I highly recommend this app, and there are so many other things you can do. 💕Wow, I don’t even know how to explain the gratitude I have for the developers of this app. I have ADHD and have a lot of trouble doing what I set out to do. I have tried hundreds of apps and nothing ever sticks. This app has everything needed - endless self-care ideas and routines, in the moment anxiety exercises, quick journaling prompts (that I actually want to do because I want the points), focus timers, an area to send prayers, or gratitude to your loved ones with cute icons for them, interesting facts (the science that goes behind the logic of this stuff) and best of all endless amounts of novelty!!! I am on day nine and I’m excited every day to use this app. I can’t wait until I can get a friend on here so I can see if I can do anything within the app with them. Best of all the motivation that Sparks me to do this stuff that is soo good for me. Thank you, thank you, thank you for developing this app!!!!I downloaded this app because my sister said I should and I thought…why not? Well I’m so glad I did! I love my little Squish and the app is so wholesome. You get nice quotes everyday and messages from your penguin. You also get to take care of yourself as well. You do things for your penguin but it also benefits you! I love that the app is still very much usable without having to go through a paywall. I’m so used to tasks costing energy in games but you actually get energy from doing things. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the insights it gives you in your week. It pinpoints what’s been bothering you and also highlights the things that made you happy. It also has a “first aid” menu where if you’re having a panic attack or need to feel grounded it has immediate exercises you can do. The app doesn’t feel tedious and the fact that I can watch my little buddy in a widget makes me connect with her more. I’m so attached to that darn penguin. Thank you developers!Finch is a phenomenal achievement - an easy, gamified way to check in with yourself, relax, and accomplish your goals. Everything that other apps had me try once, Finch gives me motivation to do again and again: journaling, habit tracking, stretching, breath exercises, writing down daily tasks. I feel much more focused and balanced using Finch, and can’t wait to continue. I just switched over to the paid version, mainly for more options when stretching/exercising, but the free version is excellent. All the emergency self care methods are always available, and the reward points don’t change between free and paid. I like being able to support the free tier for others. The Facebook community is also wonderful, with the developers constantly engaged in finding bugs, explaining how features work, and soliciting feedback.My number one goal in using any app ever is to find one that is both functional at the free level of use and ad free. 

This app is both. There are no annoying pop ups constantly trying to trick you into clicking and subscribing (there is a subscription but for once it simply unlocks more of what you ALREADY get instead of putting all the options behind a paywall). 

The content you get in this app is phenomenal.

 Tons of journaling prompts, several meditation and breathing exercises with visuals and timers. To do lists and cute stories from your pet that are just so sweet that you will be full of fuzzy feelings (and the very interesting option of journaling about each pet storyline and meditation exercise to explore how you feel about it). You can earn points to dress up your pet and the rewards come at a reasonable pace so I was never left feeling like I had to spend money to get points or like I got everything on offer too fast and therefore had no goals.

The app is also just encouraging enough to make me want to use it several times a day without being that bad for me level of addicting that makes me waste my life on apps and stress about forgetting to use it. 

Bonus love for the notification messages of love and support from your pet! Im not going to lie, its made me tear up occasionally.Wow! Where can I start with all the amazing things I can say about finch? First off you get to create your own person cute little companion bird! You can dress them up in any outfit you’d like and change their colors! There’s so many helpful activities you can do through your finch app including Journaling, breathing, stretching, yoga, fitness, goal setting and so much more! This app even includes many helpful coping techniques if you ever find yourself needing them. Completing different activities gains you points which will help your finch go on an adventure! They’ll come back with a new set of knowledge and your response will help shape your birds personality. You can even send cute messages to friends and family who use the app! I love this app with all my heart! Can’t help but recommend it!When I first on this I do anything and I saw this ad and it was about like I don’t remember the ad was but it was nice. Found it interesting about how to check in. It help you with your to like hit your goals and it’s been about like a year or two since I got this app and it’s literally so helpful and it’s just inspired me to To do like more daily task and you know level up so I can like travel more places with my pepperoni that’s the name of my chicken and I dress her and you know I just like make her happy in general and login and I love having Daily Streak. It also allows you to have journaling, and just tell her, but your experience in general, and it gives you points for that. I really suggest getting this app if you’re struggling or just need motivation.I’ve found this app an encouraging and useful way to track my journey in mental healing. There are a couple of small bugs here and there but its mostly just related to icons and visuals, I’ve never run into anything that impacted functionality. In speaking of functionality, it’s impressive how many useful features such a small team was able to include in this app. I’m by no means great at using it daily but having the encouragement of friends when I do log in is very motivating. There is a variety of activities available plus the ability to add your own goals and tasks. You also record your mood at various points of the day and the app will recommend different activities accordingly.This app has helped build soft goals and gamified self-care. If you are the type of person that tends to help others over yourself, this is the app for you. You take care of a sweet little bird you get to name and customize. The more irl task you complete and mark off the more the bird grows and gains points. You can invite friends and send them positive messages or affirmations to brighten their day. The little bird goes on adventures and you get to learn about it’s personality. If you are into cute things then it’s good for all ages.
*If you are a parent you could easily set this up for a child to establish good habits. Building journeys and goals is pretty simple. The only downside is that the monetization screen does pop up frequently on the free version.I always check mental health app reviews. Now I am the review and I’m saying, get it. The community is amazing and a nice place to be involved and stuff, the app works really well and it’s not an app you need to pay for to use well. It has cool accommodations as well, and it offers things beyond just exercises or a to do list. Plus there are reminders and forms of motivation such as energy points, progress reports and exploring to earn diamonds. Then you can decorate things but it’s also not pressuring. Plus u can like put ur friends there and write abt them, send them hugs etc OR send an anonymous loving text (soon i think) and it’s good and get it and it’s hard to keep up with sometimes but you can get back on track n stuffNot only does it 1 have adorable little birds but it 2 helps you set up goals which is really helpful for my mental health because like I literally can not get out of bed and when I see  Get out of bed 🛏️ I’m like 👍🏻 done done done especially because it’s like a game too because you can dress up your own finch give it it’s personality make friends and it basically feels like a game. Finch also includes some breathing strategies which I use often because I set it as a goal and to be honest this app is amazing 🤩 unlike other apps they are like oh you didn’t finish your goal lose points and then it makes you feel even horrible! I love this app and recommend to most people!I saw Finch advertised on Instagram. It didn’t take long for me to love this app enough to become a subscriber. I didn’t realize how much setting and completing the smallest of goals would help me on tough days. I especially love that on the toughest days, one of my goals can be “take a shower” or “get dressed.”

The best thing the developers did was to make sure you aren’t penalized if you miss a day or don’t meet all of your goals or whatever. You could be gone a month, and your happy little bird would be waiting to talk to you the next time you opened the app. No guilt trips. No losing health points. Nothing negative in this game.  

Bonus points to the developers for letting users choose their birds’ pronouns!This is the most amazing app I’ve ever downloaded. After trying dozens of “therapy” apps only to be hit immediately with subscriptions or a poorly made app. Finch is completely different! It’s the only thing that has worked for me thus far, giving incentives to write how you feel in moments not only to document but to vent and relieve stress. Not to mention as your pet grows and asks questions, it gives very insightful viewpoints on things you probably haven’t thought of. I wish I could contact the creators of this app personally and tell them just how thankful I am, or give them a hug. Thank you!! As for everyone else, just try it for yourself. I promise you won’t be disappointed.This game makes me do self care to earn points to grow my pet and buy clothing & furniture for it.  It’s fun and cute.  I set my own goals too.  Like say 3 gratitudes a day to my husband.  Or I add 3 things I want to do each day that make me happy. Then as I do my goals along with the set goals I have to pick from, I earn rainbow stones.  The more positive goals I have and do, the more I can shop.  The longer I type in my goal reflections and how it makes me feel and what’s lifting me up morning, afternoon and evening, the more points I gain.  I can see this is a great tool to have me thinking and showing up positive!  Genius!  It’s fun to change for the better with this app.I never write reviews, but I was blown away by the app. Maybe this is actually a result of this app — making me more confident and positive, haha! Finch goes the extra step that other daily growth and goal apps don’t do — they start you with an already defined list of daily actions that anyone can do. They give you more points for more words you write, encouraging you to dig deeper. They also have follow-up questions for your answers. It automatically scans through your response and highlights words it thinks are important, and tags them to show trends of how your mood is affected by these things in the long run. I really love this app!Now, I’m not writing this because I’ll get rainbow stones or more points or praise or anything—but that would definitely be the case for other apps. But Finch isn’t like other apps!! It genuinely helps me set goals for myself, motivates and encourages me while I’m doing them, and when I accomplish my goals—it rewards me.  When I don’t, it doesn’t affect my little bird avatar or my self-care journey—because my own disappointment or having my other hard work made useless is discouraging and goes against Finch values. This app seems to care about you and your life…Whether or not you have a premium membership. I highly recommend Finch to anyone and everyone!I love the characters and the outfits. I love the wide selection of goals because I am very forgetful. There is also a family tree to help you bond with those around you. This app helps me get through my day with easy goals and makes me feel accomplished with harder goals and it lets you customize your goals and routine for the day. I highly recommend turning on ur notifications because if I didn’t I wouldn’t be on it as much because I am so forgetful. It also only sends 1 notification a day so it’s not annoyingly spamming you until you get on. I like that it gives you more points the more you reflect on your day, goals, and friendships.This app is exactly what I have been looking for. My therapist said I needed a mood-tracking app and this one makes mood-tracking and taking care of yourself a fun game that’s pleasing to the eye and so helpful! Self-care tasks along with times to vent, stretch, breathe… are all guided by the app and done in-app and you get points for completing all of these things can benefit YOU! And this is coming from me, using the free version. I am very thankful so many options are available on the free version. It makes me that much more convinced I will probably get the paid version eventually. The free version has allowed me to experience so much that the app can offer!I’ve only had the app for one day and so far I love it you can take quizzes u can send your finch on a adventure and figure out things they like you can change the outfit gain energy points and gems to spend organize your house get a second pet have people join your nest and visit your house it’s a great app for people who have adhd or people who need help with organization. And also give pets to your finch by rubbing the screen we’re you finch is and it will expand your friend ship with you finch it’s so much fun and it encourages you or your kid to get stuff done so they can play on the app when they’re done.I love this app! Taking care of the bird really helps me be motivated to take care of myself on my bad days. It also really helps with my perfectionism because the app doesn’t track if you haven’t done goals and doesn’t reward you for being perfect in doing all of them, just for doing anything. The amount it takes to send the bird on an adventure is manageable even for bad days, and if you record a rough mood, it will give you more points for completing goals, which really helps to motivate on bad days. It’s helped even out my self care even when I’m manic or depressive.I have a hard time keeping track of what I do. I’ve used a plethora or both digital and physical ways, and none have solidly helped. Finch changed the game for me!

My friend mention it to me, saying that she thinks it would help me. Its nice to have a little friend to take care of, while taking care of yourself and moving through life. They’ll move with you! They take adventures and make discoveries.

You can connect with friends, and send them love and messages. You can also reflect on how you complete your goals, as well as there being entire selections of goals to help you spend some time with yourself! I really enjoy the reflecting feature, and you even gain points by writing more words!

You can decorate your finch and their room - they can even have a friend! Its a fun way to tackle to do lists, and is very sweet as well!

Thank you to the creators of this app!! I’ve heard its just a couple of friends, and I thank you!I’ve been more productive, more energetic and encouraged since i downloaded this app! It gives u goals to start with then u can create your own personal goals. There is also a finch which is a bird and when u finish some goals u earn points and the finch goes on adventures once it’s been on so many adventures, it grows! Those are not the only features, u can also create a room and neighborhood for them, along with clothes and after every adventure they come across something so the finch can learn! Overall it’s an amazing app and I would recommend to anyone🫶🐥Everyone, please download this app. There are so many self care apps out there, but this is the only one that works for me. The notifications, journaling and the adorable little birdie!! Everyday I look forward to logging in to see my birdie and keeping track of my self care to get energy points to buy outfits or decorate my home. I love this app so much. The creators really put a lot of thought and time into creating this. I only used this for two days so far but I will continue to keep track and feel motivated to log in everyday :)My therapist recommended Finch to me at one of my lowest points in my life. When taking care of myself was one of the most difficult things I could do, I really loved how this app motivated me and created a gentle and fun approach towards self care. Outside of being a wonderful self care and routine building tool, as well as a wonderful app to reflect and put down your thoughts, it’s a fun game! I love taking care of Birch and watching her grow, and I really appreciate the care that went into developing this app. It is obvious that a lot of passion and love went into it, and I am grateful.This app is fantastic, whether you’re really struggling or feeling just fine. They give optional and very realistic prompts to help you cope or just improve your day. Anything from just surviving the day and drinking water to being active and task completion. You can set reminders for the prompts which is very helpful. In the end you get rewarded by getting points to dress up your pet friend and their house. 
This whole system is very helpful for people like me who are neuro-divergent and/or struggle with chronic depression. Thanks creators, you’re really helping people out here!My therapist recommended I download this app so I decided to give it a try although I have low expectations for therapy-ish apps in general. I was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy this! You get to raise a baby bird by uplifting yourself, you can vent about your day and gain points. I tend to gravitate towards my phone out of boredom but it leads to mindless scrolling. It’s good to have a more positive experience on my phone. This app even gives me a goal to use social media less. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are someone struggling with their mental health.It helps so much to stay productive. I love how it gives you options for what you should do that day, write your goals and your thoughts about something you did! You get points from doing a task (they're so simple) and you upgrade to get clothes and decorations for your little home!! You can take a couple quizzes to help find out about your mental health (anxiety and depression) and it’s super helpful really made me happier! If you’re looking for something to boost your mood and help with your mental health then you have to get this app!!!❤️🐦",0,Battered but ResiliantshrimpieshooPetting The KittyBekaBeakKerryML28FrostyFeetz'RiannaSaintspinozaOverlord14926BeepBeep🦀uwillneverknowenlessustackmdnerdiepantsTori_simmonsRilan S.TheImpastamac125CjRoseXtraveljunkie11narohsonniepaintsmeRadientRachelgabberwabbers21annam bananasJay4020LilyponderingSwiftie thingssunnydays★彡AnnMC.an ghostboypukeThebear22,"Surprisingly Affirming & Useful as of Day # 3Best Venting SpaceIncredibly Helpful (Plus a Suggestion)Love Finch!!

The facebook group kind of brought to light that the developers aren’t as great people as you’d think. They are so focused on mental health for all that they ignore concerns of members of marginalized communities. 
You would think since they created this big bride collection that they would stand by their LGBT users. 
Well you would be wrong. 
There was a post made by an admin/developer bringing up a specific incident, and myself and many others in the LGBT community felt uncomfortable by the way it was handled. When brought to their attention, along with possible solutions to the problem that would make both parties happy, they refused to budge. They are too focused on mental health for ALL to stand by the LGBT community and create a space that is safe for them. They don’t want to push people out, even if it is due to homophobia or transphobia (in their eyes as long as it hasn’t escalated to purely hateful discussion it’s important to have “nuanced discussions”). 
It seems they are really good at taking user feedback into account until you come to them with a concern or critique on how they are handling things.",0,stitch1014,Great app but…,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,222,has_feedback,22

Really well done, great execution on all the ways Finch is motivating users to take care of themselves. I could write a blog post with all the ways this has been done haha. Two things that lower my rating (only slightly though, because the app is great otherwise): 1. Buggy/slow on opening A few times when I’ve opened the app it freezes, or loads slowly (only displays my birb walking). I hard resettled it once or twice, but one time it (maybe in combination with other things happening on my device) made my phone freeze and I had to hard restart it. 2. Tags need some work I love the idea of tracking progress in the app, and I think the larger picture is helpful (eg the chart of how you’re doing over time, the day by day display of what you did well). But my newsletters categorize my positive/negative associations of my tags based on my status at the time of logging. Eg, the prompt was “what are you thankful for”, but because I said I was 2/5 in wellness, it associated all those good things (my family, dancing, etc) as negatives. 3. Can we get more visible language on how our data is handled? Hesitant to share too much because of this. 
The benefits outweigh the negatives though, imo. Listing negatives more as feedback!",0,MoreThanUseless,Where has this been?,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,247,has_feedback,22

This app couldn't come into my life at a better time. I have a habit of putting others before myself and a good mix of ADHD I forget to simply drink water throughout the day and my health was also declining. It is always hard to stick with new small habits and this app helps me a lot! Since I practically put my finch pet ""Bubba"" before myself, I am reminded of my daily goals and what (bubba) and I need to accomplish to feel good! I absolutely love the journal entry reflections which makes the app so personal. And the best part? The one day I didn't check on Bubba since I was having a rough time, I received a warm message asking about my day once I opened the app and it felt so good someone out there.. cares. Thank you Finch!! 

Feedback: something I think would be fun to add is a voice feature that you can talk to your pet and give words of encouragement using ""we"" and can result in extra points for energy 

Also I wish I can change my avatar! I think a whale avatar would make my life complete 😂 it would be fun to choose a specific animalThis app is really effective in helping the user to be more mindful and steering towards joy, gratitude and peacefulness in every day life. One piece of feedback that I have for the developers is to strongly reconsider the structure of the “newsletters” that you send within the app and have them focus on the feel-good wins and insights, and remove the aspect of “performance” of the user within the app. I don’t want to see how many times I wrote and compare it to previous times. It makes me feel guilty for the fluctuation and undermines the intentions of the actions you are trying to foster. You also highlight “previous” stats from weeks prior right at the beginning of a users journey, where there obviously is no data, so it is not a great onboarding experience. Those are the aspects that deterred me and cased me to turn off my notifications.",0,AlexisOrcaIndiekai,Helped me mentally and physically!Wonderful for mindfulness - long term engagement could use some work,Finch Self Care PetFinch Self Care Pet,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,370,has_feedback,22

If you didn’t make your bed before, now you will!  The shop and adventure mechanics keep you invested, doing little acts of self care and journaling all day just to make sure you get those new shoes for your Finch… if other self care apps haven’t worked for you, I’m willing to bet this one will!  Even if at first you’re just checking off boxes trying to get through the goals, you’ll find you’ve journaled more than you may have ever thought possible!  Finch saves your responses as one continuous log that you end up looking back at more than you’d think, learning about yourself from yourself through a bird that is constantly growing up and also learning who they are through their own experiences and opinions.  Like come on, it’s great!  Just download it, give your Finch a name and see if you aren’t checking in on your new friend constantly!  If you’ve made it this far then I highly recommend the app, I truly think if anyone finds themself on the app more than once they’ll benefit in real ways!I feel like I always see scattered ads from this game so I finally gave it a try and download it honestly it helps a lot especially if you tend to not be open about certain personal issues it is to write down different aspects and just be open with your thoughts and the app offers many helpful things. I also recommend you wait to go on the app naturally leave it as a widget and when you find yourself thinking a lot, or having nothing to do, I would say to open the app and just see what interest you and write down some things I even got my friend who we both equally confided in to download the app and to be honest having at least one friend who also uses Finch is very helpful as it will have you more constantly on the app and you can send back cute feedback to one another such as “hugs,thinking about you,don’t forget to drink more”etc. and the app free features are very efficient and wonderful it doesn’t paywall you with much which is very dignified for a mental health app!I love this app. It took a little while for me to get TRULY into it, though I was pretty much a daily user. Once I started taking advantage of the journeys and got Finch Plus (although I had to pay full price — I think I glitched out of an offer towards the end of my guardianship month), it was really good for me. And honestly? It was totally worth the money, coming from someone who is both unemployed rn and NEVER pays for apps. The monthly journeys that they have going on now are huge motivators for me to log in every day. I love the micropets and the themes! I love that you can turn them off if they don’t suit you either. The devs are always improving the app and take any feedback. The community surrounding the app is so supportive and kind. There’s so many aspects to this app that I’ve come to learn and love while using it. This is a wonderful supplement to self care outside of the professional help that I receive (that is just as important!)I came across finch randomly and after reading a few of the (exclusively 5 star) reviews decided to give it a try, and I haven’t spent a day without it! 
Puddles is my new pocket best friend. I get to share everything that happens through my day with her, big or small. I’m a 21y/o college (temporary) dropout recovering with burnout, and I have late diagnosed ADHD. Finch’s instant mindful feedback is the perfect tool to keep my momentum through the day. I get to celebrate all my tiny wins with someone, and when it notices I’m feeling frantic it prompts tools for grounding. Using Finch every day has helped motivate me to continue to focus on growth, and given me an outlet to share my successes and struggles with someone in a mindful and calming way!  
I genuinely am grateful for my finch friends, even if I don’t know them personally! I still know it’s another person on their own mental health/self care journey, and we get to grow together !Finch is a phenomenal achievement - an easy, gamified way to check in with yourself, relax, and accomplish your goals. Everything that other apps had me try once, Finch gives me motivation to do again and again: journaling, habit tracking, stretching, breath exercises, writing down daily tasks. I feel much more focused and balanced using Finch, and can’t wait to continue. I just switched over to the paid version, mainly for more options when stretching/exercising, but the free version is excellent. All the emergency self care methods are always available, and the reward points don’t change between free and paid. I like being able to support the free tier for others. The Facebook community is also wonderful, with the developers constantly engaged in finding bugs, explaining how features work, and soliciting feedback.Finch is the only self care app that ive tried and really committed to! I have a really bad attention span and in the past i get bored of the repetitiveness of other apps but this one is honestly so much more fun! This has really helped my mental health and im really glad i was introduced to this! i think the app is wonderful but i have a suggestion for the monthly events! I tend to get a lot of repeat items, and I feel like were missing another option instead of selling or claiming the item.  my friends and i have talked about a potential “donate” option, to give that item away to one of your finch tree neighbors! This way more people can get the items they want, and we don’t have to continuously sell an item that we get duplicated!! we all think that it would be a really awesome thing to add but again its just a thought! :)I don’t normally leave reviews for apps, but I feel strongly that I need to for this one. 

As a student with adhd, depression, anxiety, etc. it can be hard to function. I have tried so many different things and systems, but nothing has worked for me. I get overwhelmed easily and can never stick with something. 

This app is the first thing that works for me! I give myself a couple of goals per day (not too many!) I’ll always do some that I know for certain will get completed (for example, washing my face or getting out of bed) so that I always have something to check off at the end of the day. 

I mostly use the app for smaller self-care related goals, but if I have a major task I *need* to get done that day, I’ll add that too. 

Overall, it’s a fun and lovely app. I love the notifications that it sends when I haven’t been on in a bit. They make me smile and cheer me up! The only thing I would change is that I wish there were a few more goal options with the free version. I like selecting goals from a list (vs thinking of them myself), but those are pretty limited for the free version. Otherwise, I have no negative feedback!! 

Tldr; great app, cute and lovely, helpful for people who struggle to stick to things, would recommendI was invited by fellow therapists from work, and I love this app so much✨💜 for inclusivity, check-ins, gentle self care nudges and more :) I love that it doesn't ask for in-app purchases, and I feel good suggesting it to clients. Thank you! The *only* feedback I have had to do with the mom/dad goals. I work with kiddos in foster care or who have lost parents, and I'd love it if that goal could use ""caregiver"" as default and then when a user uses ""mom"" or ""dad"", then suggest the parent specific goals? That may be much more complicated than I'm thinking; it's just something I've noticed with other personalized goals, so I wanted to put my two cents in. I love my little finch, and have been using this app for myself for 53 days straight.   Thank you!This app is awesome. It has helped my mental health so much since I started using it, and even their free version does a great deal of good. It’s like a gigapet or tamagotchi that I take care of by taking care of myself, minus the virtual pet death if I forget about it. I once didn’t use the app for quite some time, and when I came back, my bird was just as happy to see me as if I had just visited. No guilt, just acceptance. Their monthly events encourage me to complete my tasks, and I have even begun sponsoring people who cannot afford a paid subscription bc I believe in the app that much. The devs work hard to fix all bugs, take our feedback and suggestions to heart, and are inclusive!What a wonderful and fun self-care app. It’s perfect for all ages. Notification frequency is just right, not too much, yet enough to stay on track. Interacting with the little Finch is happiness inducing. It creates a welcome opportunity to reflect, capture gratitude, or review plans and goals. 

This app is completely ad free, and no personal information is captured. Support comes from paid subscribers who get a few more features, and from sponsors called “Guardians”.  The developers are very responsive to feedback and suggestions. Obviously what they say is true- they created this app as a way to help others - it isn’t a profit scheme.

Thank you to the Finch team for this great way to stay positive and appreciate all the good in life.I’ve never kept an app this long. Let alone a mental health app. But the creators and team behind this game put so much thought into what could keep people like me (with ADHD brain) engaged that it actually works for me! They’re a smaller team and very active within the community through the Facebook group. They’re always updating the app and making changes based on feedback so it works best for everyone. It’s very inclusive and you can do a lot when it comes to the activities and interface of the app. I’m grateful for the developers and every person who works on this app. It may not be for everyone, but if you need a supplement to your mental health journey, I recommend giving Finch a try!I love this app. It motivates me to accomplish the goals and the journaling helps me organize my thoughts. The app shows you feedback on what weighed you down the past week and what lifted you up. I find that super helpful in finding what things in my life I should avoid. There are goals that the app suggests that I really find helpful in improving my lifestyle, for example my sleep routine. And you do all that I mentioned above while growing and taking care of a cute little bird. It’s been a great help to my mental health and I’m so happy I gave this app a try. I recommend it to anyone that is looking into improving their mental health, sleep schedule, physical health habits, or just wanting to start journaling.Just download the app and check it out yourself, but if you want the feedback, here it is:

This app is amazing and by far the best app I’ve had. There’s no stressful adds, and they don’t constantly try to sell you things. There is a premium option if someone wants to support Finch with unlocked tasks, quizzes, sound time, and stretch time. If you can’t support or don’t want to, it’s alright and the app is accessible. Without the premium membership you can do fine, and still is beneficial. 
This app is where your Finch friend and you get to grow mentally and emotionally. You can add fitness goals, and the offer stretching tutorials. Your Finch friend can meet other finches and you can meet other people. 
You don’t message those people word like, but you can send others simple things like water breaks, gratitude, to be calm, and thoughts. 
This is a Journaling app, and can even work for people who don’t like journaling. Journalist or not, you’ll be willingly be writing.  You don’t have to write though.
DOWNLOAD your new FINCH!I downloaded this app 65 days ago when my anxiety and depression was consuming my life. I started the free trial right after I downloaded it, but ended up paying for the full version once my trial expired. It is seriously the best decision I’ve made in such a long time! I’ve formed many good habits, from keeping my house clean, drinking a gallon of water everyday, and keeping track of my moods through meditations. I am pretty much obsessed with my Finch and the overall piece of mind this app gives me. Join the FB page to be amazed at how fast & effectively the devs respond to feedback and update the app. I love Finch and happy to support the devs!!!This app means everything to me, and I haven’t even upgraded to the paid version yet. It’s so hard for me to form a routine or remember to do simple tasks outside of work, so I want to thank whoever thought of this app and the developers who continuously work on it. Taking care of myself energizes my birb Dotty (you get to name them! So freaking cute), and she goes on adventures, and I just think anyone who’s struggling needs this app. It’s free. I’m making the choice to upgrade to plus though just bc I’m so in love with it, and I want access to some of the deeper journaling promptsI am a nurse practitioner and work as a mental health care/neurology. I recommend this to patients and use it myself. I explain the free version has so many useful, evidence based tools, and if they desire the paid version just expands the options. I get so much positive feedback from patients and other coworkers are using it as well. All thanks to my 15 year old daughter and her friends who started using it first. Which makes me so happy that the younger generation is recognizing a need for more mental health tools and accessing them. I love this app!!!I’m autistic and have ADHD and have a hard time knowing what to do next for self care and reflection. The continuous prompts make it so easy to continue writing and reflecting! I also love the suggested goals and automatic highlight\tags of specific words. I think what really keeps me interested is the companion! I named her after my Squishmallow 😌 
IDEAS: 
More interaction with companion like mini games and my opportunities to chat, pet them, feed them. 
Allow photo uploads and voice clips! I like photos to go with my journaling and I also like song writing so voice clips would be nice ♥️A friend of mine recommended Finch to me last month, and I’ve used it every day since. I highly appreciate the inclusivity of the customization options. The daily goals help keep me productive. Even when I don’t finish everything, the app reminds me of recent and throwback goals. I also use it for exercise, which is great because I’m not self-motivated when it comes to that. There are tons of fun free features, but I’m excited to try the Plus version thanks to a sponsor! (I have a feeling I’ll have more feedback for that in the near future.)",1,bvbvgffddultimatejade🤠cassgan☀️CatieKittehSaintspinozakanyeee wesDanc3ch1ckEnduraPetSirenScuttleMoolineColor babe_jjlVanessa ShadowFoxalexans1197Cheyenne B.AshlieDNPQueen-VelvetBec Taps Buttons,"Better than most paid titles!Honestly give it a try!Absolutely worth itA new best friend in your pocketFree version is great, pro features even better, awesome developer supportbest self care app everThe only thing that’s helped meThis therapist loves FinchWould give 10 stars if possibleA great little app!Love this app!I look forward to using the appDownload this, please!

Especially if someone is a perfectionist or has adhd.  On one hand a goal is stay off social media, but then the app just keeps adding options!  You finish one thing, then it says, dig deeper?  It could go in forever.  Then all your time is on the app and not in the real world.
Then there’s how you feel every time you start the app - not for everyone, I hated doing it because I didn’t feel any of the categories for me, and you can’t bypass it.  
Then there are the “points”.  Ridiculously high points - too high.  I get you want it to feel like a game, but seriously you need to chill.  De use your focus and stop trying to do it all.",0,Zoe364,"Way too much!!!  Open the app and next thing you know, it’s been over an hour",Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,137,has_social,61

So I deleted the app (which I made sure the data was SAVED) and it started me from the beginning. I had collected so many things that I wanted for my finchy and now they’re all gone and all my friends are unlinked from my tree. Uninstalling because it can’t be restored. 😞
SO I’m updating my review, I would love a fb link feature or some easy way to save data in the near future. Giving 5 stars back because it’s literally the best self care app out there and the team is very friendly and caring. Just PLEASE make new ways to save data.

So much is going on and I lost touch with literally everything and almost everyone in my day to day life. I downloaded it off a whim, didn’t really have much calling to do so, I just like birds, and I thought it was going to be another idle game. I opened it to find that it was so much better than that! I chose the gender of my finch.. and the first recommended name for it was “pickles” and I cried.. pickles is a nick name of mine from a very special person in my life, and it greatly reminded me of them, and made me feel better on the spot. I also have a way to get my feelings out in a healthy manner now rather than how I was before. Pickles and I have been growing every day, and slowly (but surly) have been getting better, I’ve already recommended this amazing app to about 6 of my friends, and my boyfriend, to all help us with our feelings, and to try to teach us how to better communicate our emotions (something I personally have never been good at) but since I’ve gotten attached to this app, and have been using it daily.. I’ve learned so many things, andhave already   helped myself some… this is an absolute must have app for me now, and I love that. 10/10 will continue to recommend!I wanted to continue on another rating I made! I’ve been having a lot of trouble with depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and having a lot of trouble with my mental health. I’ve been dealing with a lot because of everything and the way I feel about myself. I see negative in everything and I have low self esteem and have a lot of hate Towards myself and everybody else especially past friends, friends and family. I felt very bad Talking to anyone of the way I felt and whenever I did they just made me feel bad about it or I usually felt selfish to tell somebody how I feel or just bad when I did. I would feel useless to everyone and always would hide my emotions before. I’ve always thought of just taking my life because I feel so tired mentally and when I saw finch I thought it was a cute game to upgrade a cute little bird and see their growth but it was to help me with my growth. Finch helps me express and say how I feel and how it’s going for me every day and say things I feel to scared to tell anyone and it’s just been helping so much and I’m so happy I saw it. It also lets you choose pronouns which makes me feel very happy and comfortable. I love this so much and it’s helped me a lot even with a short amount of time. I thank you guys for making it, helping other people. I recommend for people who need it to get it for any help you. Thank youThis app genuinely motivates me to journal and write about my feelings. It sounds cliche, but this has been saving my mental health lately. It’s also just a really convenient way to journal. It gives you prompts which is great because I have never really know what to journal about to practice things like gratitude and positive reflection. It also categories key words and people’s names so you can click on the tag and see all of the entries you’ve made that contain that word/person which is really nice! While I like the idea of journaling by hand, it has always been too difficult for me to adopt a routine of sitting down to write out an entry every day. I have found that journaling on my phone makes me journal a lot more and since I’m on my phone all of the time anyways, I just open the app at random times and making smaller entries throughly the day. It has been a good app for keeping me from constantly scrolling through social media because it has a widget that puts your cute owl friend in his room you can customize on your Home Screen. Whenever I see my little owl on the widget asking me to chat it catches my eye and I open the app to journal instead of opening up a social media app. All around great app for journaling and working it into your everyday life!The first thing that made me kind of happy when i heard of this games was that the title was finch! I have recently named myself finch and seeing a cute little mental health bird who is a finch made super excited!! Not only that I also love the fact you can change the name and pronouns at anytime! My pronouns are always changing so seeing that option i was stoked! I also enjoy how motivated this app has gave me. When i checked the daily goals option on there I immediately did them later in the day and felt so good about myself! I also tried out the stretch feature and I normally never do stretches or any sort of yoga but afterwords i felt great!! every muscle felt nice and relaxed. Lastly i really enjoy the breathing exercises, especially the anxiety one. I struggle with social anxiety and that breathing exercise was super helpful! the only thing i would change is i would like a bit more options for the daily goals or at least be able to make your own custom ones. I cant get plus because i can not pay for it and i would like other options like ‘read a book’ or ‘clean my room’ those would be super helpful but other than that I recommend this to whoever is reading this!As an LPC navigating Telehealth- not because i like Telehealth but because I am being force by my agency to use it - it’s been hard connecting with teens. This app was recommended to my daughter who suffers from anxiety and now i recommend it to my clients. My teen clients have been benefiting from the ease of its use, the great coping skills it offers, and the fun ways you can connect with the widget. Highly recommended and for my clients who come for limited financial this has been a great free app. Most other apps you have to pay to really get the benefits of it. With Finch you can still greatly benefit with the free options. Thank you for making this app free to use for those who struggle in the mental health field. Finding resources for clients who can’t afford apps like calm or headspace. The best part is it has a section call first aid that client can use when feeling down and needing support. It will even provide a connection to a suicide hotline if the client is in crisis and having no one else to talk to. From a License Mental Health Counselor and a mom, Thank you for all the help you provide.if you’re like me, you’re extremely unorganized and have a bad memory. you’ve tried many different schedule/mental health apps and none have worked. i encourage you to try this one. it’s similar to Habitica. i’ve been able to brush my teeth, shower, and make my bed for all 3 days i’ve used this. it allows you to build up a schedule instead of throwing everything in there at once. it’s very customizable. it lets you plan ahead. it has MANY different things to do including soundscapes, timers, yoga, breathing, quizzes. basically everything you could ever want. i like that there’s not much “social media”. the thing that annoys me about other mental health apps is the social media aspect. it’s nice to see uplifting posts, but social media leads to mental health problems for a lot of people, thus defeating the point. this app is perfect if you’re looking for a more personal journey to wellness.

surprisingly, you can access a lot of stuff without paying a cent. but i’m considering it anyway because i can tell the devs actually care about the users.This app will not replace a therapist (nor is it advertised as such), but it has already made quite a nice difference in my life. It provides a cute, simple, and fundamentally satisfying “gameplay loop” that has you raising a little bird friend by performing actions such as setting/achieving goals and writing reflections. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed doing these tasks, particularly since I’ve never really stuck with to-do lists or regular journaling before. But Finch makes it feel rewarding and fun, and as a consequence I am feeling much more content, grateful, and productive than I have in some time!

The free version of this app is refreshingly feature-rich and has no ads whatsoever. It’s definitely not necessary to upgrade to the paid version, and it isn’t pushed on you too hard. I am thinking about upgrading just because I want to support the developers, though. For all the harm smartphones and social media, etc seem to be doing to us, Finch feels like a genuinely beneficial use of the technology.  If you’ve read this far, give it a shot!I have ADHD and social anxiety and I have been using Finch for a few weeks to help with them. I’ve found so much comfort in this app. It’s not boring to look at, which is a major problem for me and other self-help apps. I also have large broken up into smaller little goals that are much easier to achieve. And, I can read my daily reflections in the form of bullet points instead of everything being in one long essay. On top of everything else, I get to take care of an adorable little bird whenever I take care of myself.
Now, I’m not so good with features unless they’re straight-up handed to me. I also have a lot of goals throughout the day and I want to be able to list them chronologically. For instance, my morning goals be at the top, and my nightly ones at the very end. I’m not sure if I’m able to do that already, which is possible and I just haven’t figured it out yet, but if not, I think it’d be beneficial to people such as myself. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. =)Finch is so helpful for self care, and it's deceptively cute!! Some days I log on just to take care of my little bird, then end up taking care of myself too. The app has guided breathing exercises, soundscapes, stretches and exercises, goal trackers, and lots of journaling prompts. Doing things earns points for your bird to go on adventures and grow up from an egg to an adult. You can also earn coins to spend on things like new outfits and decorating your bird's room. Plus! There are seasonal prizes, like themed decor and clothes, and you can even earn little pets for your bird!! There's also a social element, where you can send your bird over to visit your friend's birds. The developers have created such a fun, well-balanced app, and it's obvious a lot of love has gone into this. It feels fun and game-y, but not like you have to pay to play like a lot of gameified apps. Both the paid and free version are fun and helpful. You really can't go wrong trying it out!! I recommend this to anyone who wishes self care could be fun.Don’t even know where to start.  My therapist suggested this and thought I would give it a whirl.  Things like this haven’t worked well for me in the past so was a bit skeptical.  But this is truly the best of the best.  My reasons for starting  therapy was I just get really in the dumps and very unmotivated in the cold winter months. After one month of using this app my motivation is through the roof. I’m loving having a clean kitchen to come home to, a made bed, clean floors and on and on. Plus I love writing to my Finch about my day. I’m having so much fun watching her grow, buying clothes for her and collecting all the  🌈 stones she brings me so I can buy more clothes.  This is a very fun addictive like game and the developers are always adding new features and are very involved on FB.   They just added a social feature which I haven’t had time to use yet but that can only add to the level of fun.  So I say if you are looking for some motivation this is the app for you!!    (From someone who NEVER writes reviews)The Finch app and team, the Finch community has helped me tremendously these past 31 days. A lot has happened and I downloaded and tried almost the entire Apple App store’s library for self-help and self-care apps. I am on the autism spectrum, and I am non-binary, and the app is accommodating for both. My Finch’s name is Poké, I don’t know how others use the app if they see the digital pet as a pet or an extension of themselves like a virtual child or self. Anyway, Poké is still a child and maybe I don’t play the game with the objective to collect everything, but through journaling and trying the first aid methods of grounding, I can push through some of these complex feelings like grief, major depression and social anxiety, insecure survival coping mechanisms. I “stim” and I cry a lot, I have trouble regulating my emotions, and I check in with the app voluntarily — not because it notifies me aggressively like other app notifications, but because it is a vital toolkit that has done the science and research. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars I recommend this app to everyone.I’m someone who struggles very much with depression, and that can make it easier to not take care of myself mentally or physically. Setting tasks for myself to complete is extremely helpful and i’ve realized my mood and over all confidence has increased since i’ve started using Finch daily. It has definitely changed my outlook, and the breathing exercises are PERFECT for me. 

The Little Finch itself is an amazing idea is probably the main reason i have been able to stay so consistent with the app. I named my lil guy after my first ever cat who passed away recently. Thats a type of connection i wouldn’t have with the usual type of self care app. Overall i think it’s an actual lifestyle changer and recommends downloading 100%. Ive even got my sister to download it and everything! 

(the ONLY issue ive had is a couple of times the screen will freeze, but i think you just have to be careful with constantly exiting the app and opening it from a quick link or widget)Over the years I’ve tried, and faithfully used, many self care apps, goal trackers, and diary apps. Some have been great, others not so much but I never really found an app that gamified taking care of myself while also setting goals to make myself a better person. And then I found Finch. Finch encourages you to be better but also has grace for the moments when you fall short. There’s a really nice social aspect to it that lets you encourage others while maintaining your privacy too. And to top it all off it’s centered on an adorable bird that you grow and teach and dress up as you go through your journey. I honestly haven’t found a single thing I don’t like. I’m just sad I’m in a spot right now where I can’t pay for premium simply because I want to support the developers. The app is great even in the free version, and I hope the devs can keep it up and let the app stay this awesome and free for folks like me!I deleted social media apps at the same time as I got this and let me tell you, this app has completely replaced them with no regrets. I’ve been going through some tough times for a while and it’s made me extremely anxious, irritable and depressed. I’ve seen talk therapists and my baby finch Maple has been just as helpful as a year of therapy was. I’m excited to take care of her, my boyfriend also downloaded the game and I can’t wait for Maple and his finch Noodle to become best friends. Most of the features are accessible in the free version, without ads! And I’m genuinely so impressed with the quality of this app. The gamification of self care could be the missing X factor for me and I can see some light where there previously was none. A huge thank you to the developers, thank you thank you thank you! You are lovely, kind and talented people and I wish all the best for you and your mental health 🌸🌸I love this app so much. Ive decided to disconnect this summer and be a better self and this helps with that. So many other apps have annoying pay walls and you cant do anything. This one has a premium subscription but there is so much you can do without having it. You can basically make a yourself a schedule for the day, with whatever you need help with. Hygiene, mental health, bettering yourself, and you can customize the goals, when you want reminders (which arent annoying), how many times a day, and more. I also never liked reflections but these prompts are so good and are making me more intune with my emotions. Ive never wrote so much about my feelings ever but ive written over 900 words in a day. Its actually amazing and a support. Its also a good thing to distract yourself with by doing exercises (physical and mental), doing reflections, soundscapes, quizzes, etc instead of social media. Its really a great app!!I have had trouble with self care for years. This app was my solution. I’ve used it literally every day for weeks and it’s just been so helpful. I’d always recommend this to any friends or anyone looking for accessible self care. Not only is the plus completely optional, you still have a great experience without it. Not to mention, watching your little birb grow as you become more happy and take care of yourself more, you unlock new features that get you excited. I’m a genuine customer. Not an ad, nothin. I have all my friends added on here and I genuinely think it strengthened our relationships. Not only that it’s just cute, personalized, and honestly my favorite app on my phone. Not to mention their socials are really active and they are always answering questions. I genuinely think that this app is one everyone needs. It’s perfect for everyone. Personalized goals and birbs for everyone!!!So firstly I’d like to say you guys designed an easy to use app that helps someone actively engage with difficult to do tasks when they are mentally ill or easily distracted. So thank you for that! I’d like to give some suggestions though if you could make little notifications that get the dopamine receptors in the brain going the same way social media does I think you could potentially help people hack their brains for a positive purpose. Now I will talk about all the features yall created which I love and appreciate: the find a helpline, the positive quotes, the silly lil birb outfits, the preset easy goals you can pick, the tree town so you can potentially connect with friends who now can mutually motivate you, the decompression exercises, and finally the cute lil art style. Thank you for creating such a great app!I have tried so many selfcare apps and none would hold my attention longer than a week. I’ve been using finch for months now and i haven’t gotten bored. The combination of a fun game, being able to customize my finch completely, and having friends on the app who can visit me, has made this app super easy to continue using. The app is constantly developing and upgrading with awesome updates i love.  I love the tag system so i can see how certain things are effecting me. I love the insights on how i’ve been feeling recently. I love all the options for micro journaling. Honestly i have no complaints for this app. I’ve recommended it to over a dozen people. It’s one of my most heavily used apps on my phone, and i’m a heavy social media user so that’s saying something. If you’re on the fence about downloading, i promise it’s worth it! Just try it!!I love this app so much! I love that it motivates you to care for yourself and gives you plenty of options for self-care and mindfulness. It has plenty of options for customizing your tasks and doesn’t punish you for hard days when it’s hard to accomplish your tasks. It’s so worth paying for and sponsoring others if you can, but I love that they also make premium not necessary to enjoy the app and that you can win a lottery for a month of sponsored premium from the selfless guardians that use the app. The developers really listen to users and make their app enjoyable for everyone. Plus the community groups on social media for this app are so loving and inspiring. If you’ve ever needed help keeping track of tasks or being motivated to do them, please give this app a try. I promise you won’t regret it!I’ve been using finch daily for about 2-3 months now (my Lily is a teenager, they grow so fast! 🥲), and it’s honestly been revolutionary for me. It’s helped me to get my days and healthy habits back on track, and as an added bonus, it’s helped me to start curbing my social media addiction! Instead of doom scrolling, I open Finch and see what other things I could do with my time instead. Combine all of this with the satisfaction of getting to take care of your own modern tamagotchi / nintendbirb, and the entire app from top to bottom is a home run. 

Also, HUGE shoutout to the devs for keeping the free option so accessible for everyone. They’re constantly improving the app, and you can really see all the love and effort they’ve poured into it. 

TLDR; Just download it. Your birb and mental health will thank you 🐥👍🏻This app gives you many different tasks to help you take care of your baby bird as it grows. When you reflect, you earn more energy with more words typed. Which is a perfect way to journal and reflect. A friend shared this with me and now we are all getting more neighbors through our friend groups. The best part, hands down, it opens the conversation around our mental health with each other. Which could never be easier than now. Another personal favorite for me is that I want to be on this app so I am looking at social media less and less. If you are even hesitant about this, download it. Give it 3 days of actively trying to take care of your pet, then review it. I haven’t paid for a single thing and I still love this app.I was going through one of the worst mental health crises in my life and didn’t think things could get better. Hence, when I’m depressed, I scroll endlessly through social media, and I see this super cool ad for an app that helps with mental health. I just thought, “well, I can’t afford therapy so let’s try this!” after downloading the app. I used it to dive into these thoughts and be more honest with myself about how I felt, which sometimes left me in a pretty emotional state but even then, finch had me covered with the remaining breathing exercises and the sounds of the ocean to bring me back and calm me down. Without this app, I don’t know where I’d be today. I want to give a huge thanks to everyone who put their valuable time into developing such a fantastic app🫶🏼.Finch is a fantastic app. You hatch a finch that you can name whatever you want! I chose Lily, because I thought it was cute, and some other names are Daisy, Finchie, and Molly. You can add people that matter to you to your tree town, I added some of my cousins and family members, and you can reflect about them. There are ones like “What do you think (name) was like 10 years ago?” or “What do you think (name) respects about you?”. You can set goals for yourself like stop using social media after 6pm, brush your teeth, avoid heavy meals before bed, get outside once, and also wash face. I highly recommend buying Finch, and you should also get Finch plus! It makes you feel so good, I just bought it yesterday and it is probably my favorite app on my phone.This app is amazing. It brings me joy and keeps me on track with my goals everyday. It makes me feel accomplished and motivated to work towards my goals. I need an external motivator and have struggled with ADD, anxiety, and depression for years. This app helps me practice self care and keep focused on what I want to achieve. I feel supported and appreciate the external motivator to keep me accountable. This helps me also evaluate how my mood has been and who lifts me up the most. I am so grateful to the developers of this app and hope that someday the cost pf plus may be lifted for the families that might really need the support. I have recommended this app to all my friends and feel like it is helping me be a kinder, more social and more responsible person. Thanks Finch! :)much like the others who have reviewed before me, i’ve fallen out of touch with myself and have been feeling very down again. this app is so cute and motivates me to write down how i’m feeling by giving me prompts and keeping track of trends in what i write so i can see what's going on in my mind all in one place. i've gotten my best friend and my boyfriend in on it too and they love it. the free version is amazing on its own but i’m probably going to pay for an annual subscription. if u have a finsta, u will Love this because it's a truly private experience that's also super cute and helps u manage ur self care and mental health goals without the grandiosity of instagram or other social media accounts. i can’t recommend it enoughI am OBSESSED with this app! It has made me appreciate the little things I do everyday to care for myself, including things like simply getting out of bed and brushing my teeth, which can be challenging if you are neurodivergent or have depression/anxiety. They also include more challenging goals like exercise. Something unique to this app that I have seen are the social goals like telling your dad you love him, reconnecting with an old friend, etc!

I love doing the self reflection and meditation exercises and collecting gems to spend on my finch’s home and outfits! I originally only planned on playing with this app during the duration of the free trial but I think I am actually going to subscribe because I love it so much. 🥰I originally saw this app on social media and didn’t think too much about it until I downloaded it because I thought the bird was cute. Before this app, I’ve had trouble keeping up with self care or even forgetting to do simple tasks throughout the day. However, Finch constantly keeps me reminded with simple words of encouragement and helps me feel better especially if I’m having a bad day. This app has helped me find myself and grow as an individual. I’ve literally recommended this app to all of my friends and family. I really do think the people giving this app anythjng below 5 stars just wanted to see it lose its 5.0 rating. Please give this app a shot- it’s so worth it!!This game is honestly fun, relaxing, and helpful (ex: goal setting, anti-sucide, and coping methods for everything). The only issue I have is how easy it is to cheat the system. Don’t exactly know how to stop it because Finch isn’t a sentient being. Maybe this game can have a Finch social media for everything you do. Take a photo of what you did (unless you can’t) and post it onto Finchmedia. I think this can be really helpful, maybe add a texting feature too? I would love to communicate with my friend on Finch. I still live with my parents and I can’t afford a phone and they haven’t bought one for me. I think this would be so nice to talk with friends. Just a suggestion. Love to all! <3I usually don’t rate apps but I was truly motivated to do so with this one. I’ve been looking for an app that can help with my anxiety and other medical issues that I have. This app seems to somehow fit enjoyment, journaling, caregiving, meditation and so much more into a fun and engaging way. I’ve tried other apps before and lost engagement so quickly. So having an app that I’m excited to open every morning and night is so much fun. I’ve actually found that I’ve spent less time endlessly scrolling on social media because I would rather journal and reflect on my day. It’s so great and I definitely will update later on to see how it helps with my anxiety in the long term.I’m super obsessed with this app. I’ve made it a widget on my phone so I can easily have access to it. They offer male, female, and non binary penguin options which is so amazing. This app has helped me organize my life and I’ve even been drinking water every day to be able to get my penguin new clothes. Also I wish I had a huge social media following because I would love to be sponsored by this app. I’ve personally already gotten nearly 10 people to download it and they all love it as well. If you’re contemplating this app just go ahead and just on it. I’m even going to be buying the year long premium because of how much I love this app. But the free version is great too!Self care apps that you actually WANT to keep using are honestly hard to find. Finch is different. I’m taking care of myself, learning to take the day one step at a time, and loving on a little bird friend while I do it! I l love the capabilities to be friends with other people on Finch, so you can send some love to someone you know without being awkward about it. You can dress your bird, raise your bird and teach them life lessons - and you can go on different journeys to improve yourself and your life. When I’m feeling bleh, I’m no longer picking up my phone and numbing myself with social media - I’m picking up Finch and making some real progress. Five stars <3I love this app so much. They've managed to utilize the crave for dopamine with self-care and healthy habits. Instead of turning to social media and video games, I feel motivated by accomplishing little tasks that I may not have done otherwise. Not only do I get excited when I can finally press goal 'complete' and see encouraging animations and sounds, but I feel better about myself at the end of the day.  

The goals are simple so I don't feel any pressure or reluctance to start. The animations are adorable. There's a ton of self-reflection writing prompts and breathing exercises. 

This app is doing an awesome job and I can't wait for more to be added! Definitely recommend.I will be 47 soon. My generation had/has a whole different  way of communication and socializing. Even people that were open minded enough to accept people that were experiencing the social situation of being accepted for feeling as though they were a different gender still sounded as though they were riding the fence in whether they were supportive. I have not always been the best supporter but after my mental breakdown and meeting a transgender man and hearing his story and the pain he experienced “coming out “ I felt great compassion and was moved to be different after my experience. This app did a good job providing simplified explanation for pronouns for people.I’ve been trying to reduce my social media use, but I’m so often on my phone that I end up using social media anyways. Finch provides a great alternative that actually makes me feel better after using it! I love the cute characters and prompts. The prompts make you reflect on your thoughts and positive moments in the day in concrete ways that are fun and not too difficult or too easy. I love the bullet point format! 

 They also have a wide variety of prompts and activities, including writing-based but also breathing exercises and goal setting options. I really recommend this! Especially for those looking to escape social mediaI’ve only had this app for about three days, but I love it so much. I’ve been recommended  a different app by a therapist, but this one is far better. It gives you a lot of prompts to write about your day, and it’s very helpful. Sometimes I come home feeling awful, but after being asked to write everything good that happened that day, I don’t feel so bad anymore. I love that I can set goals for myself each day, and I love the social aspects of this app as well. You can invite friends to your adorable tree town, and send them virtual hugs! I cannot recommend this app enough. If you struggle with mentor health, and even if you don’t, everyone needs to try it.I was skeptical about a gamified mental health and self-care app but I really love it so far. The goals are especially useful as a to do list for the day and the interface makes completing them fun. There are a few little bugs but the developers are providing a wonderful service in this app and they are improving it often. I don't use a lot of it (writing, the social aspect, etc.) but the daily goals you can write yourself and categorize are extremely helpful for just getting through basic life tasks each day. Unlike most apps the interface doesn't get in my way of using the parts I want and ignoring the rest.I struggle with routine and have a hard time with self care for a lot of reasons! I am neurodivergent and I have a chronic illness. This app is working for me so far!

I heard about this app from someone commenting on a targeted ad for a different self-care app that was too expensive 😅 I downloaded it because I’m working on a self-care handbook for students and want to have some app recommendations and I kind of fell in love! I like my little “birb” but I wonder if that’s too millennial-coded for Gen Z? 

I’ve enjoyed the social aspect of checking in and sending good vibes to my friends. I also like the sounds from petting my bird and tapping the micropet. Dressing my finch up and decorating their house is also very fun. 
I appreciate the mood check ins, the ability to do reflections, the “journeys” where goals can be related and automatically repeated. So far I’ve managed to keep track of brushing my teeth for a few days and it feels easier than trying to do it without the app.I’ve used this app for a couple of weeks now and I think it is a great thing for people suffering with different mental health issues such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. People can use this app to help relax their mind, unwind from the day, and make sure they are just taking care of themselves. It allows you to set goals for yourself and then sends friendly reminders throughout the day to make sure your goals get completed as well as positive affirmations that help keep you going. It is definitely a comforting app that goes out of its way to personally check on your mental health, which is so important.I already wrote a review but I’d like to rewrite it. I struggle with social anxiety meaning It’s really hard for me to make friends and or talk to people. One day I was scrolling on tiktok and found the finch app. Let’s just say, I’m so glad I listened to everyone who told me to download it. The finch app makes it easier to express my feelings. It makes me feel cared about in a way. I use this app no kidding everyday. I also encouraged my mom and sister to get the app and I see them on it too :) I know a lot of apps are overhyped and people just download it to say they have it but this app is truly amazing. You should definitely download it and support finch :)i’ve been using this app for over a month and a half. i have anxiety and depression and that gets worse when i don't accomplish a strict regimen of things, especially in the summer. I downloaded finch and something about the goals, the adventures, the cute little pet.. ugh i love it so much. my bird aphrodite is officially a child! this app has become a part of my daily routine, i just sit down for five to ten minutes write out what i did that day and it makes me so much more accomplished. totally recommend! five minutes of this adorable app a day will accomplish so much for your mental health. what is five hours of social media doing?First of all, this app is just unbelievably cute. The little characters and the way you can interact with them are adorable and fun! More than that, though, this app is surprisingly insightful about and useful for mental health. The little goals you can set are not only proven methods for bettering your mental health, but they can help you feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day when you check them off. Also, the social tool is fantastic, since it gives a way for friends to gently support each other in ways that they might not normally. In all, I highly recommend this app!Honestly, i was hooked onto this app when I first saw the ad on social media. This is a great app for everyone who is and isn’t going through something. I was going through depression and when I started using this app it helped my mood and health. It’s a great app because it encourages you everyday to do something good. Of course, I skipped days because I was lazy or just forgot about it. But that’s okay. Everyone has there days when they don’t want to do anything. And this app doesn’t make you feel guilty about it. Who ever made this app probably changed peoples lives and maybe even saved one.i love the app and have grown a connection to Mushroom, my little birdy! i just wish you could go into the shop and buy what you want. there’s things i want, but haven’t found in the shop available like..ever? so, it’s a little annoying.
.
here’s some things i wish would change about the app:
1: you could buy anything in the shop, not just the stuff the shop owner has to offer.
2: finch plus wasn’t a thing. not everyone has money to have the luxury of the extra benefits of this..yes, the finch team has been kind enough to gift us the finch plus benefits, but it’s not permanent. 
3: make it where, for the events, you can pick from ALL colors for EVERY ITEM, and be able to get everything from the event even if we don’t have finch plus.
.
like i said, i love playing this. my little bird, Mushroom, has helped me much more then i thought he would. he’s made me smile so many times..but these are some annoying things i’ve dealt with while using the app.I’ve tried a few different therapy and self care apps only to delete them within days, hours, sometimes minutes.

I’ve been consistently using Finch for almost 2 months without skipping a day! It’s been helping me a lot with getting myself back on track with my mental health and life in general since I beat cancer a second time recently. 

The breathing exercises, stretches, reflection journals, and social interactions with other Finch users are some of my favorite features!! There’s also audio relaxation therapy too, but I tend to fall asleep with those. LolHello! I have had Finch for a few weeks now and I am positive it is the best Self Help app out there. I have tried everything, and nothing makes me more motivated than a little birdy. I got one friend on the app and they added another, they added someone else (and so on). Now we are all connected and it is the BEST for mental health. I am constantly looking for ways to get my Finch back from Adventuring sooner. This means I am either reflecting on my own life, completing yoga stretches, practicing breathing strategies or winding down with a soundscape.

Because of this app my screen time on social media has gone down and my energy has gone up. It is the first time in a long time that I have gotten up early to go try something new! I am so excited to see where this app goes in the future. 

Also I paid for the full version but honestly it is not expensive for what you get! TOTALLY WORTH IT. 

Thank you Creators of this app. I cannot begin to thank you enough 🥰🥺I absolutely love this app! It’s amazing to me how Finch inspires me to live more positively. It encourages me to really appreciate my life and the people around me more. It encourages me to take better care of myself by offering stretches & exercises, as well as breath and mediation work. 
I may feel overwhelmed at the thought of journaling, actually putting pen to paper, but for some reason I’m not with with Finch. The question prompts are wonderful & I can choose what questions I answer. The more you answer, the more energy your Finch gets.  You will grow to love your little bird and the connection you will make. It’s so fun! Try it!!I have been using this app for about a month now and I am so obsessed. Whenever I look at my phone, I ALWAYS find myself checking the finch app instead of social media, which I’ve noticed the lesser social media usage has made a huge difference in my mental health!

Here are some things that I think would make the app even better!! 

- Being able to send people in your tree town PERSONALIZED MESSAGES, on top of sending good vibes, also being able to type something out to personalize it to what you think your friends need. It would make the app a lot more interactive, and I think would make it even more good for mental health, being able to receive and send special personalized messages. ❤️

- After your finch is an adult, you are able to still keep your finch, but hatch another baby finch, and then your adult finch and your new baby finch would be like siblings and the adult finch would go on adventures with the baby, etc. 

Live this app!!!!This app has helped me start each day by taking care of myself! My job has flexible hours and I live alone, so it can be tough to get the day started. Now I start each morning by writing some reflections, stretching, and setting goals. It’s also nice to check in here throughout the day, rather than scrolling social media; it gives me ideas for small breaks or reflections. Plus the bird is adorable!

I have the paid version, but I really appreciate that the free one doesn’t pester you to sign up. I would definitely recommend it!So I’ve been going thru a “self care journey” and I think finch is the best way to go! I love how you can take care of your birb and add pro-nouns! I also love how you can reflect with finch and set goals for your self. You can also earn a connection with your birb which I am a big fan of. You and your birb can go on adventures together and invite friends too! I just think it is perfect for everyone who wants to optimize self love in a more manageable way! I am very satisfied!! Do recommend!
More about my birb: (this part is just for fun)
Color:Green 
Name: Margo
Pro-nouns: They/themI am a social worker and I have heard of other apps you can check into to help add an extra boost to one’s self care or to help motivate someone into action and this one has to be my favorite! 
It’s like a self care tamagotchi; in order to feed your finch energy, you have to do something for yourself! The daily quotes are really helpful and being able to have a reflections journal is a wonderful tool as it helps us to foster our gratitude. 
I highly recommend this app for anyone who struggles with depression or lack of motivation! Great job, FINCH 💕I have an emotional connection to my little bird, Noodle. Unironically this is curing me. Clearly this can’t fix everything but this app and Noodle has motivated me to eat 3 meal a day, work on my breathing, go to my classes, and reflect on my life. I have never been so appreciative of everyday things. I don’t buy apps ever, and I’ve been using this one for free, but I am strongly considering buying the full subscription! But the free version is so great. Everyone get this. Download it now. I’ve told every single friend about this app and I think I use it more than social media. I 🤍 NoodleI often find myself awake in the middle of the night searching for the newest self-care app, trying it out, and either keeping or deleting it. Some I have loved, and then later updated to a new interface that doesn’t work as well. Finch is here to stay! I’ve invited my coworkers, and the gamification of it makes it so special. I share my finch’s discoveries with my students, and it’s served as a tool for connection as well as self-growth. You can adjust the goals based on what you need, not generic goals.I wish I hadn’t given other apps five stars because I want this one to get the highest rating I’ve ever given. It solves a lot of the challenges I’ve run into with other similarly themed apps. I appreciate that it doesn’t punish me for missed days and that it allows me to link it to friends without creating social pressure. Being customizable but offering loads of options to get started helps me think about what would actually help me, and it regularly makes me laugh with quirky little bird nonsense.My therapist recommended I download this app so I decided to give it a try although I have low expectations for therapy-ish apps in general. I was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy this! You get to raise a baby bird by uplifting yourself, you can vent about your day and gain points. I tend to gravitate towards my phone out of boredom but it leads to mindless scrolling. It’s good to have a more positive experience on my phone. This app even gives me a goal to use social media less. I highly recommend giving this app a try if you are someone struggling with their mental health.This app is amazing. It is so helpful when it comes to helping with mental health and making stronger connections with people. I am a college student and I cannot afford the membership, but they have an option for those who can’t afford it. It is such a wonderful community and I wish to one day sponsor this app so I can help people just like me. This app is amazing I don’t know how much I can express that. The birds are such a cute and motivating feature. This app has helped me a lot and I hope you consider downloading it. Have a good day :)this game has helped me out a LOT. it's so fun and sweet and i love being able to check up on my friends in a really easy way that doesn't necessarily involve social interaction (i have crippling social anxiety smh). i love muffin, my finch, and the only thing i could ask for in this game is a bigger pride selection. i wish that it was easier to buy your pride flag rather than having to refresh a bunch of times. i've been searching for pansexual outfits or flags all month and haven't found any! other than that i absolutely love this game.Love it. I’m a holistic health coach and have recommended this to all my friends, family, and clients. They love it too. I’ve been using it every day for a while now and have seen improvements already. For example, I’ve been working out and taking walks outside more. Easy to use and super cute. Love that it doesn’t have ads. My only small request is to add more items for my little finch. Lmk if you have an affiliate program so I can post in my newsletter, social media, and more. Thank you to everyone working hard on this game!I started out thinking I wouldn’t use it at all, but I have grown very fond of this app. I have dealt with panic/anxiety and depression for years. I use to check social media and just stay there for hours doing mindless scrolling. I deleted those apps off my phone and added finch. It’s a much nicer/calmer thing to wake up to and start checking things off of my to do list. It has helped me get tasks done, even the small ones like drink water. The little notifications that say “thinking of you” are just too cute.This app is amazing. It combines addictive elements of social media with self care. It is so fun to grow ur little finch pet and see it explore the world. It feels like sims lowkey where you can get attached to ur avatar. Everything is ADORABLE. You can get pets for ur pet and watch them build a personality based on your interactions with them. Then it uses these connections with ur pet to get you to come back to the app everyday and complete your goals. I take more time to myself and have built so much confidence with this app. Amazing for teaching you healthy habits.",1,MintmoonsStraberry karebearpieholemonster123456789105666Sam and Deans girlteddy 테 디giubroeuw akeiPetting The KittyBekaBeakcooki47gabchapchapstxn'dNerdy_squirt92caseymrussellg.f.b12Hufflepuff lolzsquat kweenKen-Ken 11Creating nicknames is hard@tiaelsterrhoag9414Al3xand3r24ItsLosray_ray1013riley foitSage ScarberryKiwithebudgieTrustworthy person.. i thinksarahzilla18Kkkeeennndddrrraaapenn <33333Spsp33rocksJLGraham461dreamer1every nickname is taken7364Unaha-Clospashes2asscheeksMGrulke2002mummy mumziebayaan e.Jesusrocks3UKANIANAjaxx crowK76WNLexayluvShehi1SereniteuyeTardigrade2024coolgames253Mausi8814zoemar03hhepperle814liz&laniboypukeJamiee😊❤️gkn0106Tsae-Ni LindtgrosshansRosiegymnast,"A truly great appThank you so muchGreat app for journaling and working it into your everyday life!Finch is amazing!Great tool I used as an LPCcute and helpfulA little gemIncredibly Helpful (Plus a Suggestion)Love Finch!!

Really well done, great execution on all the ways Finch is motivating users to take care of themselves. I could write a blog post with all the ways this has been done haha. Two things that lower my rating (only slightly though, because the app is great otherwise): 1. Buggy/slow on opening A few times when I’ve opened the app it freezes, or loads slowly (only displays my birb walking). I hard resettled it once or twice, but one time it (maybe in combination with other things happening on my device) made my phone freeze and I had to hard restart it. 2. Tags need some work I love the idea of tracking progress in the app, and I think the larger picture is helpful (eg the chart of how you’re doing over time, the day by day display of what you did well). But my newsletters categorize my positive/negative associations of my tags based on my status at the time of logging. Eg, the prompt was “what are you thankful for”, but because I said I was 2/5 in wellness, it associated all those good things (my family, dancing, etc) as negatives. 3. Can we get more visible language on how our data is handled? Hesitant to share too much because of this. 
The benefits outweigh the negatives though, imo. Listing negatives more as feedback!",0,MoreThanUseless,Where has this been?,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,247,has_tracking,46

There’s one thing I do wish that could be changed is the startup menu with the quotes and emotional state. The quotes are fantastic please don’t change that, but I wish there was a skip option for the emotions because sometimes I really don’t know what I’m feeling and I don’t want to just put down anything and mess up my streak. That and I wish there was a messaging system to send out to other finches and you can do it once a day to avoid spam but it’ll help for people that have online friendships or ldr that they haven’t heard from in a day or so.",0,Azn_Pandah,Love this app!!,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,138,has_tracking,46

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts, thank you. Your kind words and support are what keep us going! — Steph & Nino 🙇🏽\u200d♂️🙇\u200d♀️', 'modified': '2022-06-18T06:47:50Z'}","I have been going through a lot of mental stuff for a while, I have anxiety and depression and running self-diagnoses of ADHD. I can’t focus on literally anything and my brain doesn’t like to keep track of important things like homework. I got this app out of desperation, totally expecting it to be stupid and deleted within the day. Then I got my bird. Her name is cheesecake. I am now wholeheartedly attached to this bird. Not only has this app made it so that I feel an extra happy kick every time I finish my tasks by getting gems or energy, but everyday it sends me messages to assure me and I swear I almost cried the first time it sent me one. This app is as amusing and adorable as it is practical and I love raising my bird and finally catching up on school work. I made both my sisters get it so I could have a tree town and we send each other little hugs or calm vibes all day. There is a paid version I have not tried. It isn’t necessary in order to use most of the app. So don’t let that stop you. I love the simplicity of the app, no games, no streaks, no pressure to constantly get on the app to stay on track, though you can set reminders, you just hang out and raise your finch. I love it. I can honestly think of nothing I would change. Except maybe add like a tutu for the birds to wear because that would be cute, so thank you to the developers, you saved my gpa and mental health.I’m so thankful for this amazing app and its supportive community 🫰I have tried like six different planner/habit tracking apps this year and Finch comes out on top! It’s cozy-cute little environment is less stressful and overwhelming than other tracker apps, and Waffles, my bird, keeps me engaged with the app and I check it on my own without reminders (and with reminders bc i added a few :P.) I love that every time I open the app it asks me about my mood because some apps limit the mood selections to once daily- which quite frankly just isn’t realistic. I use the free version and I LOVE IT. It doesnt limit the apps functionality (which I’ve seen on free versions of certain habit apps- one even limiting you to THREE GOALS A DAY unless you pay for it- not cool.) I’ve only been using it for a week, but I will certainly willingly pay for the full version once Ive created a secure habit out of using the app. OH And the fact that you can “sponsor” someone else to have the full benefits of the app? Literally so sweet, I cried when I first saw it <3 

My current suggestion is to allow you to see certain reflections from people in your friend tree. I like to reflect about my sister and would love to have the ability to toggle showing her my memories about us growing up together, and it would be nice to see what she thinks of me!This app seriously has everything. I love the different soundscapes, and they even have a meditation timer in here. They have a lot of different journal prompts, and a lot of them are things I wouldn't have thought of. I like the way you can visit your friends, and even add people to your town that you just want to keep in your thoughts, or that you love. I love the goal setting and tracking as well. The quotes that begin each day are great. there's even a place where you can write daily affirmations. I like the ability to rflect on the joys of the day also. It's those little things that lift you up so well. There's different quizzes to track your depression, anxiety, etc. It will even guide you through various exercises, (although that part doesn't work the best for me as a voiceover user.) And everything earns you moonstones which you can buy things with. And you get to do all of this while taking care of a baby birdy and improving yourself and her life as well. I am so impressed with this app each day I use it. I think it would rock though if we could see what our friends' goals are and send them good vibes when they achieve them.  There's still more in this app that I haven't mentioned.I’ve never had success with self-help/self-care apps because once the novelty has worn off I can’t stick with them. However, Finch has kept me hooked for over a year. Taking care of the little bird really does change how you view self-care. Since my experiences shape by bird’s, I’m more aware of my responses and tend to try to focus more on the positives than negatives. Plus, the purity of my bird’s worldview is endearing. I like that the app has guided journal questions and tracks your moods and the goals and journeys are great. I’ve been wanting to get the premium since I love that app so much but it’s an expense I can’t quite afford. However, I haven’t gotten tired of the free version. I like the emails the Finch team sends weekly - it’s clear they really care - and the little visits from staff birds. This is one of my favorite apps and I think it has helped me. The only thing I would suggest is adding a water tracking section. I’m sure I could make it a journey but it’s the one habit I’m really struggling with right now and I haven’t been great at keeping up with it when setting goals each day. It would be cool to have it built right into the app.I’m always looking for new ways to help my clients be happier and healthier and I downloaded this app at first to see if it might be a great tool for journaling and habit tracking and tbh I ended up using it myself! I struggle with depression, anxiety and c-ptsd and this app has really helped me to stay up on my journaling, happinesses habits and track tends in my thoughts and behaviors. It has also helped me make sure I keep up on healthy habits such as water intake and stretching. While all that would have been enough to wow me. It has also created a community between my family friends and clients where we all connect and support one another. I really couldn’t be happier with all it offers. 
Btw I used the free version for the first 6 months and it was great. I did however switch over to the paid version when I saw how much I used it. It makes it a little more fun and is absolutely worth it in my mind but not necessary to see the benefits. 
If you’re thinking of trying it, just do. It’s adorable and healing all at the same time. I can’t thank the creators enough.I first got the app when a friend asked me to so we could be friends for tree town. When I first got it I was like “I’m probably gonna use this app for a day and then stop” I was so wrong. I have been using the app almost everyday multiple times for a month. I love my bird Cloudy and my favorite part of the whole experience is when your bird comes home from exploring and shares something with you. Having the ability to bond and grow your bird definitely helps motivate me to set goals and do tasks for myself that also help my bird. This app is so wonderful and your tasks become adjusted to how you say that you feel which is great. I have used the app so many times and I love it. It’s a great experience overall and I like how it’s fun but also beneficial to yourself. The app won’t pressure you to have a streak or anything which makes using it a better experience for the individual. I highly recommend this app to anyone trying to improve their mental health or trying to understand themselves better or even just trying to have healthy habits. It’s all here in this app. 5/5 Stars for sure.I am not one to leave reviews, and I have just gone out of my way to make sure I leave one for Finch. This app is absolutely amazing. I’ve downloaded habit tracking/self care apps here and there and none of them are able to hold my attention long enough to be useful. Finch has changed the game! It’s so interactive, a game for self care and you win by taking care of yourself… genius! I can’t express as someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, how well thought out this app feels for those exact things. It goes beyond just the basics of habit tracking/goal setting, with added “reflections” where you can jot down thought or journal as you go, there’s breathing exercises, stretches, and (my favorite) quizzes, plus so much more. You really get invested in your baby bird, getting to customize it with cute outfits and things, watching it grow. I really think the creators of Finch deserve a spotlight for this app because it truly has been a game changer for me and my daily life. So thank you to the Finch team, and to anyone who has actually read this, DOWNLOAD THIS APP!I randomly found this on the App Store one day and downloaded it. Day 115, and I still use it. This app has been really great for actually motivating me to journal. At first, I only did it because I wanted rainbow stones, but now I’ve gotten into the habit that if I need to vent, I got my Finch to help me (Rant Zone is my favorite). I struggle with emotional trauma and chronic anxiety, so this has saved me from a lot of angry outbursts because I kept stuff in. I use it for daily stuff like cleaning and sometimes I put difficult tasks so that I have some more motivation and frame it as self care for Future Me. I love to dress up my finch everyday, even for whatever weather is happening in the real world. I love checking in on her. I tried the free trial and I loved it so much I decided to keep premium to support the developers. Also, enable notifications, trust me. Thanks to the mood tracking, if I’m having an awful day, my finch sends me encouraging and gentle messages. And it’s not spammy, either, it always seems to pop up when I need it. Y’all made something really special. 🐣I’ve never written a review for an app before but Finch has changed so much for me in such a short amount of time. I have ADHD and no apps, no lists, no planners, no routine, nothing has ever worked for me— but Finch like actually keeps me engaged and motivates me to want to take care of myself. The guidelines it gives with its journeys is really helpful and has made me so much more fulfilled and calm in my days, since I never knew *what* to do in order to “nourish my body” and all. Super helpful and no negative reinforcement like some of the other habit apps! Everything from the habit tracking to the reflections to the exercises to the soundscapes— just everything— has been incredibly helpful and I never thought i’d remotely be interested at all honestly. It’s also super cute and runs really smoothly and is like sentimental, sweet, encouraging eye-candy. I never would write reviews but this has been the only thing to ever work for me, and I can’t recommend it enough truly. Love this bird app.I enjoy the daily goals a LOT. It’s the only app I’ve found that doesn’t penalize you in any way for missing a day, missing a goal, skipping a goal for any reason. There’s no obvious negative reaction if a streak is broken (that I’ve seen) so I don’t feel guilty for not being able to do it. HOWEVER getting to check them off and getting TIME SPECIFIC REMINDERS !!! To complete them is very rewarding and makes you want to do it to make your little bird happy.

I like the “how are you feeling?” Check in when you open the app. It’s nice to have that moment of reflection, even just for a second. I feel I can be honest to the birb as they won’t judge me for any answer I give. There’s zero negative reaction.

Getting to visit friends is so fun! It and the adventures are a nice way to feel like you’re taking care of it, without the stress of an actual health system. I like getting to remind my friends that I’m thinking about them, and getting to see eachothers birds together is precious. Especially with long distance friends!

I also enjoy the questions! They give me something to ponder and I often learn something new about how I feel on a subject! And I like that you get good things regardless of the answer. There’s zero right or wrong and it’s lovely!

All around I am VERY pleased with the app! Will continue to use it and will definitely reccomend it to people! If it becomes possible in my budget any time soon I will consider upgrading for sure!When I downloaded this app while browsing through the App Store, I honestly thought I would immediately delete it like I do with every other self-care app. However, I’ve logged in every single day since I’ve downloaded this two weeks ago, and it really helps with motivation. I realized that although I love games that have streaks, it de-motivates me when I lose a streak after not logging in one day. With Finch, there aren’t any notable streaks to worry about, and it feels freeing. It makes me think “It’s okay if I forgot to wash my face this morning. Just do it tomorrow.”

Yesterday, I had a really bad anxiety attack in the morning and when I opened the Finch app and logged my mood, I noticed that the goals were moved down and I was provided with gentle reflection prompts. I’m not sure if that was programmed intentionally, but it really did make me feel better. 

The only con I have with this app is how slowly you collect rainbow stones. I would love to see some mini games in the future!So a few weeks ago I was complaining to my therapist about how I always have trouble sticking with self care apps after the initial week I download them and she recommended Finch to me. Not only is it completely adorable (my penguin Penelope is the cutest thing ever) but it actually provides tools other than writing ‘diary style’ like quizzes for mental health and breathing exercises, etc. It’s really nice to have different outlets to express myself and to track my moods and goals and daily thoughts other than writing my life out everyday and I really appreciate that. Plus the quizzes are SUPER helpful at tracking depression and anxiety and looking at trends (if that applies to you.) Another bonus I look forward to is the customization portion because who doesn’t want to dress a penguin in a Hawaiian shirt and some sandals?!?!? Overall I’m in love with this app and I look forward to tracking my progress over time and seeing what new updates bring!I’ve tried a lot of different journaling, mood tracking, and self care apps. None have stuck like this one. There is a bit of a gamified element which keeps me engaged, but more than that I actually feel connected to the adorable little Finch avatar. The “adventures” make me smile. I think that’s what makes this app special - I feel connected to something else. 
Another thing this app does well is the “tagging” of free form text. I appreciate that the devs do not store my written journals, but they do a great job of surfacing specific prompts at the right time based on some of the tags I’ve used in the past. 
Their SOS feature and curation of prompts based on my current mood is right on point. 
I just don’t have any negatives to say for now. If you’ve tried other self care, or mood journaling apps, and they haven’t quite stuck, I highly recommend you give this one a try. It’s a gem. It actually makes me *feel* better.I have finally reached my 100 days/adventures with Eggo (my finch). I was recommended this by a friend and I am so happy I downloaded this game. What an amazing experience that has helped me daily! I normally don’t like ‘journaling’ or games like this to help with mental health, but wow has this got me on a self-care streak. Amazingly cute art, it’s so fun to dress up your finch and decorate their room. I really like that I can still do everything normally without having to pay for the full version, and the full version is at a reasonable price too! This app has because a staple in my routine and helps me become more self aware and grateful. It helps me write things down, which I have learned makes me feel better when coping with anxiety or depression issues. Thank you to whoever worked on this app. I’m so incredibly thankful for your hard work. I want to help people like you have helped me with this app! <3One of my friends originally suggested Finch to me for help with pandemic/post pandemic anxiety. I was pleasantly surprised that my mom and my sister both were using it too. 

Finch is great for tracking my feelings, light journaling when I feel like it, and holding myself accountable for tasks that I tend to fall short of when I begin to feel down. I’ve added Mittens (my ‘birb’ friend) as a widget to my main screen to remind myself to do important things like take my vitamins, make my bed, and have escalated myself to now having reminders for donating items I don’t use, and to call old friends each week. 

I love that some of the suggested things are good mini-journaling prompts (I hate journaling) and breathing exercises, meditation assistance and grounding techniques that my therapist uses. It keeps my ‘toolbox’ of good balancing practices at my fingertips. It’s nice to know when I’m feeling anxious or stressed, Mittens is there for me. Literally. Sometimes Mittens actually sends me thoughtful thinking of me notifications on my phone. I feel warm seeing it, and love interacting with my mom and sister’s birbs through the app. 

It’s cliché to say something has been life changing, but I would say this app is life enhancing at least. I still have regular therapy sessions, but Finch and Mittens help get me through the other six days of the week.Finch is a phenomenal achievement - an easy, gamified way to check in with yourself, relax, and accomplish your goals. Everything that other apps had me try once, Finch gives me motivation to do again and again: journaling, habit tracking, stretching, breath exercises, writing down daily tasks. I feel much more focused and balanced using Finch, and can’t wait to continue. I just switched over to the paid version, mainly for more options when stretching/exercising, but the free version is excellent. All the emergency self care methods are always available, and the reward points don’t change between free and paid. I like being able to support the free tier for others. The Facebook community is also wonderful, with the developers constantly engaged in finding bugs, explaining how features work, and soliciting feedback.Edit: I can’t find anywhere to submit suggestions for this app so I’ll include them here… Having a dark mode would be very beneficial, especially for Reflection entries. The bright white background hurts my eyes when I jot something down before bedtime. Also I think it would be helpful to go back and edit emotions in the How Are You Feeling Right Now feature… sometimes I select one option without really evaluating how I’m feeling, then wish I had picked something else. Still loving this app!!

I have only had this app for about a day and I already feel so much more positive! It helps with setting goals, practicing gratitude, and tracking daily progress for tasks and habits. Definitely a must-have for someone with executive functioning difficulties, or really anyone who needs a bit more positivity in their life.I never review anything, but this app deserves all the praise. I have a better track record of daily use with Finch vs any other productivity or wellness app I’ve tried. I love that it’s focused on self-care, so I can’t load it up with work or school tasks and then overwhelm myself and start avoiding it entirely. I love how it encourages me to be mindful or gently check in with myself throughout the day. It’s incredibly accessible that way. I never feel anxious about “needing” to play it to keep a streak; rather, I look forward to my character’s daily adventures, and it truly motivates me to do just a little bit more as I’m able. The art is really cute and I think the tone is just right. It’s hit me in the feels with a timely visit or notification more than once. I’m just really grateful to have this in my life right now.Never write reviews on apps but had to for Finch. 

Been using it for the past few months and I’m so happy with it and grateful to the developers. They truly care about their users and are extremely thoughtful in their designing to be as inclusive as possible. 
I love that they put all the self-care things that I need into one app- to-do’s, journal reflections, habit tracking, stretching/yoga/breathing exercises, grounding techniques for panic attacks, even lovely soundscapes for white noise! 
Maybe next guided meditations? That’s just me being greedy :p
The gamification of taking care of the finch and giving it outfits and decor for its house is so fun and sweet. When your finch asks you questions about what they see on their adventures, it can feel like a mirror to reparenting yourself. 
This is my one counter to Black Mirror style technology lol. Finch is technology being used for good and genuinely backed by love and care.
 I appreciate that Finch does not make exploitative decisions, when they could so easily be tapping into the self-care “trend” where people seem to be advertising that they can sell you wellness for a steep cost or getting every penny they can out of their users through micro transactions or splitting up access to each feature. 

Thanks again y’all! 💖💖💖I actually really enjoy this app. I had several other apps to try and help me develop good habits, but most I gave up within a few days. Turns out they were boring for me! I’ve been using this app daily for a little over two months and I love it! The idea of allowing you to take care of a pet/friend that you interact with is fun and reminds me much of a video game (which I enjoy). I like to think of my goals of the day as “missions/ quest” one might get in games and when they’re completed I get rewarded with gems/energy that allows me to get more fun clothes for my finch. So I’m motivated to try and get as many, and a lot of time: all, of my goals done! It also has other things such as mood tracking, journaling, stretching idea, and breathing exercises. I really recommend this app overall!When I first on this I do anything and I saw this ad and it was about like I don’t remember the ad was but it was nice. Found it interesting about how to check in. It help you with your to like hit your goals and it’s been about like a year or two since I got this app and it’s literally so helpful and it’s just inspired me to To do like more daily task and you know level up so I can like travel more places with my pepperoni that’s the name of my chicken and I dress her and you know I just like make her happy in general and login and I love having Daily Streak. It also allows you to have journaling, and just tell her, but your experience in general, and it gives you points for that. I really suggest getting this app if you’re struggling or just need motivation.I can’t wait to see what the Finch team does with the look and design of this app because that’s honestly one of the only things I think can be made better. Though I wish there were more settings for goals like “until it’s done” or something, the lack of that helps me break my goals into smaller pieces. I love helping my finch grow and sending things to other people that might make them feel better. They also offer free plus for members who can’t afford it (like me) which helps a lot when I need more that 5 minutes of a breathing exercise. Overall, it’s a good app for goal tracking, has a lot of exercises that can help maintain wellness, and seems to genuinely care about its users. The motivation of wanting to help my finch grow makes all that even better.I have bounced between a variety of selfcare & productivity apps, usually getting overwhelmed by having to have multiple apps for journaling, mood tracking, habit forming, breathing exercises, etc! It is amazing to have ONE app that fits all of these into one experience, AND gives me a sweet little Finch to be responsible for in the process. I feel motivated to take care of myself, because I feel like I am taking care of this virtual pet in turn! 
I enjoy that everything is in one place for this app, with the click of a widget I can easily check off my goals for the day, reflect on how I'm feeling, and even track my daily mood! The insights & weekly newsletters help me see how I'm doing, and genuinely this is just the best self care app I've had to this date.This is such a cute app and it’s regularly getting add ons and updates, which is awesome. I’ve seen it really evolve over the last year and I love it. I’m a big data freak so tracking my mood is fun and also very informative. For example, you can physically see how miserable I was in my last job versus how my current one is great! You can even see when I got sick, because those days pop up as bright red in a sea of green. The new clothing and house designs are probably my favorite part, and they now finally have a daily reward which pushes me to make sure I get all my energy in for the day. Overall it’s a great app and I really love it, enough that I pay for the premium because I actually get my moneys worth and use it every day!I truly didn't think this random app would be so instrumental in my healing. I’ve never been able to keep a routine, and while I’m still not perfect, I can always come back to this and remember the very specific things that I can do to help make a dark day a little better. The app is made with care and intention and it shows through in every step of the way. I have bipolar disorder comorbid adhd and this truly helps me balance habits with fun little goals (great for adhd) while also tracking my moods and giving me the motivation to want my little finch to do better than me. I love this app, I love the creators and I love the guardians. Thank you!I love so many things about this app. 
1) The widget available to put on my home screen reminds me to use Finch throughout the day, helping me keep my thinking positive and better tracking my mood shifts throughout the day.
2) You have OPTIONS but the format is not overwhelming. You can take quizzes, write affirmations, practice mindful breathing, listen to calming sounds, reflect on feelings, goals, and achievements.
3) It automatically tags certain words so you can more easily and quickly find or read over your daily entries. An example would be words like: grief, joy, happy, appreciate, job, thoughts, etc. 
4) The little birdy that you nurture is such a good metaphor for your mental health and self-care. By doing the tasks in the app, you are improving your personal growth as well as the little birdy’s growth! Plus the little birdy learns lessons that can be applicable to us as well (exploring our differences, for example).
Okay, I could keep going but I think I’ve made my point. I can’t wait to upgrade to premium and see what other features this app has!Before, I didn’t brush my teeth often. But now, I am better then ever and am recovering with my clean teeth streak! This app really cheered me up at the lowest, even if ur not a person whose sad, this app can be used for even going outside, or can be used to clear ur mind and listen to the beautiful nature sounds to calm you! And a great deal is that you can buy Finch premium with a free week trial that for 1 month cost around 2 dollars if I can remember ? And it’s not too expensive for a year either. But even without a Finch trial, you can do a lot of things still, like quizzes, writing about your thoughts, and the main thing.. setting ur goal and watch ur cute bird grow!Ok I’m gonna preface this by saying that this is just my own experience as a person with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I will say that I have the paid version which can be cost prohibitive for some people but there are free paid accounts given away every month and at the time of me writing this about half of all users who don’t have the paid version have been gifted it. 

I find this app very helpful. I enjoy the bird and the micropets and the monthly challenges. Some people dislike having to maintain streaks for rewards but I find it motivating. I know some people find that anxiety producing so be aware of that. 

The main reason for my rating is that this app was able to make me build and stick to (for over a year now!!!) a morning routine that sets me up for success for the day. 

Being able to plan out my day in advance and having no guilt or shame around skipping/not completing a goal is a huge win for me too. 

Finally their intentional inclusion of disabled people and queer people in the accessories is something I really appreciate.So many habit tracking apps only give you a tiny amount to work with unless you upgrade.  Finch offers so much more for no cost. Yes, there are perks to being Finch Plus but they are just that perks. For no cost, there are unlimited goals, freedom to write your own goals, and more. I like that there isnt a way to buy rainbow stones. They are available to everyone the same way. Self care by completing goals, starting and maintaining journeys, and journaling. I enjoy sending good vibes to friends and family who are tree neighbors. Also, looking at announcements on Discord over the past few months, the speed of improvements is brisk. Thank you, Finch team! Keep it up!I am SO THANKFUL for this app. It has allowed me to expand my mindset a lot, looking closely at little aspects of my day rather than just a “day” overall. I also appreciate how the app isn’t pushy (giving constant reminders that could be negative, such as ‘your —— is thirsty and needs you’, or something of that nature) and is focused on positivity. With other apps I see notifications threatening the user, saying that their plant/animal/streak will die out if they don’t check up on it, but Finch just sends positive reminders. It’s also so nice to have little visitors come around and get to customize my little guy. It’s a wonderful app and I think everyone should get it!!!Out of app after app, trying to find the perfect app to manage and maintain a decent tracking of my mental health, this one has to be the best. Looking after my little finch (named Opal), I realized something: as your little baby finch learns and grows, you learn and grow with him/her. I’ve learned that setting daily goals helps keep me on track for the day. I’ve learned that my motivation is better than I thought it was. And of course little Opal has learned that all bobs live in pineapples 😊. I look forward to all of Opals adventures to see what she learned during the day while I was completely my goals. 

Best app for maintaining and tracking mental health. Good job, team!This app is exactly what I have been looking for. My therapist said I needed a mood-tracking app and this one makes mood-tracking and taking care of yourself a fun game that’s pleasing to the eye and so helpful! Self-care tasks along with times to vent, stretch, breathe… are all guided by the app and done in-app and you get points for completing all of these things can benefit YOU! And this is coming from me, using the free version. I am very thankful so many options are available on the free version. It makes me that much more convinced I will probably get the paid version eventually. The free version has allowed me to experience so much that the app can offer!I am absolutely adoring this app. I've recommended to many. I love the widget and the stretching for winding down before bed. It's kept me consistent for 2 weeks, I'm proud!! I love the tracking of progress within the app and the reflection as well. I've been using it for almost 2 full weeks consistently and I'm considering getting the plus version. But even the free version is amazing!! No ads, and it's really well versed in many ways, you can personalize your journey in so many ways free and then even more if you do upgrade! It's adorable, fun, and it's helpful for getting a good mindset, creating habits and so much more.I have tried a lot of mood tracking apps, mindfulness apps, and goal setting apps, only to give up on them when I am not in a good place.

Finch has all of those abilities and takes a lot of the mental load off of you. It prompts you to track your feelings. You can write your own goals, but it also has basic, pre-made goals that you can select without thinking them up/typing them in. Sometimes if you are feeling low enough, typing ‘brush teeth’ feels like it’s too much. But choosing it and seeing it on my list gives me the motivation to actually brush my teeth. 

That is what sets the app apart for me from all other mental wellness apps - it seems acutely aware of how difficult it can be to wake up in the morning, and it encourages you to take baby steps and still feel proud. The Tree Town feature is another favorite for relationship building and maintenance when you fall out of touch with people.

And the bird is adorable, of course!I am a HUGE finch fan. Am I almost 30? Yes. Do I think it’s a little juvenile or silly? Yes. Do I care? NO because it being kind of silly is part of what makes it great! This app has made such a huge difference for me in difficult times— the goals you set for yourself are simple and I never ever feel pressured to complete them OR guilty for not. I just feel accomplished when I do, which is what it’s all about! Reminders are gentle and uplifting. Tracking my moods, goals, and etc. has been so interesting and helpful. I just can’t recommend Finch enough. I love being able to send good vibes to people too!I’ve never reviewed an app before ever, but I have to for this one. I cannot begin to explain how life changing this little birb app has been for me. I’m AuDHD, and have CPTSD, and I think the biggest thing I love about this app is as your little cheep grows, it’s like I’m healing my own inner child by having a “gigapet” that tells me to drink water and talks to me about discovering their likes and stuff. The only reason it’s not a full 5 star rating is because I wish there was a daily symptom tracker within the app, not “just” habit tracking... thank you to the creators of this amazing, cute, life saving app.This app is very helpful, It’s helped me keep track of chores! And there are things that help me calm down my racing thoughts and anxiety. There are quizzing for depression, anxiety, and ptsd, so if you’re wondering about you having those disorders you can take the quiz and if you score high enough, do more research on it and then talk to a professional for a diagnosis to get the help you need. I love having a little birb friend as well, mine is named Wilbur and they use they/them. I love how they remind me about my goals for the day. I like the little notes you get when you open the app.Who would have thought guilt would be my motivating factor? I enjoy the sweet notification “reminders” they feel like harsh than other wellness apps I’ve used. I love this little bird and watching him grow. So yes, I feel a bit of guilt when I see him looking for me. I jump on finally and after ten mins or so I’ve maybe done a breathing exercise or wrote a paragraph about a current frustration , and I always feel better after for it. The motivation is there to get on the app at least once a day, a streak I’ve never pulled off before.I have been looking for a habit tracker and I tried this on a whim and I am so glad I did. One of my goals this year is to journal more and Finch acts as a dynamic journal of sorts with prompts for reflection then it is also doing mood tracking when I do my check ins. So I love that. The more I take care of myself and set goals the more I’m thanking care of my Finch buddy. I am looking for ways to self motivate and focus and I can see how thoughtfully designed this app is to assist with that. I like the gentle way it engages and the myriad of tools and exercises that it has for me to engage with.honestly i went into this app thinking it was gonna be another one of those self care apps that i use for a week and delete, but i've been using Finch for a couple of months now!!

i love all the customization options for your pet, and even though i already use a physical journal, it's still been a really good resource for managing my anxiety and tracking my habits. definitely one of the better & more useful self care apps out there. ive even convinced some of my friends to use it!I feel like I’ve had a significant improvement in my overall mental health since I started using Finch. Unlike in other apps, I don’t feel shamed for letting a streak drop or pressured into keeping it up. It’s truly a useful, and surprisingly entertaining, tool. My Finch is my buddy. They remind me of what I want to get done, they understand that different tasks can be considered wins on particularly hard days, they support and celebrate my wins, and I get to help them style themselves and their bedroom! It’s become such a helpful habit to check off tasks throughout my day.I found this app on TikTok on a random comment that I wish I could remember. I’ve been having issues keeping myself accountable and Finch has helped me so much with that. I absolutely love it and it’s so fun. For someone with mental health issues, this has been amazing, especially the mood tracking. I also actually finish my daily goals because I don’t wanna cheat my birb. Totally worth getting the paid version, although the free one is good too. I am so thankful there are no micro transactions and everything you earn is just from your goals.I love this app <3 You can interact with your bird, set personal goals for what you need to accomplish, and even get more personal! They have a section called “First aid” that give you a zone to rant, do breathing exercises for anxiety and have a “Step toward healing” section that is perfect for tracking how your healing process is :) I thought I wouldn’t stick with the app and then I started getting personal with my experiences, customizing and setting perfect goals for me. This app is fun and helpful at the time if you wanna give it a try please do!I absolutely love this app. The goal setting, the reflections, the mood tracking.. all of it. You get to reflect about certain people too and make goals for them in specific as well. The little bird makes me so happy, mines named Mo. I love dressing her up!! I also really appreciate the friend thing, my one friend has this app and we send each other the “good vibes” and have fun with it. There’s also things to help with breathing and there’s sounds for sleeping and other things… this app has everything I could possibly ask for <3",3,246000001111wafflesismylifeHappyHijabiChelentazDaoxenWolf_playz_hamesbrinichole3Artday97Levvity LevLilMonsta321yeeunnieLexio:)Jlevans84Swemma130KittenMittinzSaintspinozaScrewCensorshipboundbookdateK273859372Zickanouwillneverknowenlessustackmdsidra bamjordayndayPeachymomo1133NomamesyoucantbeseriousEmilynicole121170minsootyyleenieo7IAparentlilpanda13Chris meowgabberwabbers21Tashy65555MomDadImPopPunkPrincess HalleyFrank!3(Sometimes)GoroAkechismalewifeElleAximilli87patrixareforkidsMalTruAnna_BM22Hannahbelle:)Krunchman75,"No seriously, get it.#blessedThere is so much more in this app than you would think at first glance.A little buddy to help you care for yourselfBeen using for a year straight and still love it!Love this appThe Best App I’ve Ever Come AcrossThe only app that makes me journalHonestly game-changing (especially with ADHD)My favorite self care app thus far.Surprised meThis self care app is absolutely ADORABLEThis is the one!Absolutely amazing and inspiring 10/10Good for refocusing, habit buildingFree version is great, pro features even better, awesome developer supportSuch a cute and fun app!Wonderful appI’m so gratefulGreat app!So glad I downloaded itGreat AppBest Self-Care App I've DownloadedHad for over a year - love it!!This app was made by good people who actually careFinch is such a good self-care/mental health appGet this if your struggling!Very helpful for meDay 43!

I’ve been using this for several months to plan my days and even keep track of the things I’ve done. Unfortunately the glitches have been getting worse, and the goals have complete minds of their own. I can’t re-schedule a goal on a different day anymore, it will stay on the current day no matter what I do. They also won’t repeat at the correct time, so when I set a goal to every 3 weeks it won’t actually show up every 3 weeks on the day I scheduled. Goals will also randomly duplicate so they’ll be listed multiple times in a single day, and I can’t get rid of them. And worse of all, one of my journeys randomly decided to move EVERY SINGLE goal I’ve completed onto the current day and mark that I completed them that day WHEN I DIDNT. It erased my progress in the journey because it only registered that I completed over 20 goals in a single day, rather than spread out over a month which I did. I can’t even change them back to their original dates because like I said, when I set a goal to a different date it won’t actually work and will still be stuck on my current goal screen. I also don’t even remember when I completed all these goals, so there’s that. This app is an unorganized mess now. And as someone with a need for things to be organized it’s incredibly frustrating. I have no choice but to stop using itWas really great when it worked… Nothing like creating an app that causes stress and anxiety… when you’re supposed to be helping people with the stress and anxiety! 🤦‍♀️ I have repeatedly emailed regarding my issue… Get the standard we will reply in 24 hours confirmation and never hear back from them, no correction in the game… no fixing of bugs/glitches… 
And then they try to get me to pay for it every single time I open the app… which I wouldn’t mind doing if the app actually worked!!

I have been doing my goals daily and yet nothing is updating and all my creature does for the last two weeks is sleep. I really liked this game to….

It is fixed now, I think, but that makes me hesitant to keep using it especially as I had been relying on it a lot before. I really wish there was an option to save progress online vs. locally (on your phone) only to both avoid issues like this and to help me, with a very bad memory, not forget to create save files and thus possiby lose everything. I also wish the letters to say “complete” for a goal were not changed with the update to be so tiny…for some reason it’s stressing me out.

Addition: I’m really stressed out by the extensive customizing of the bird’s colors you have to do as it gets older. It would be fine if it were either more simplistic or you could access different colors for free, but as it is it’s turned into something I just can’t keep up with. And the problem is I’m sensitive to visuals, so if I don’t like how the bird looks I won’t want to get on the app. And, possibly a bigger problem, if I can’t get the bird to look like something nice or familiar, then I feel alienated from it and like the app doesn’t care about me.

P.S. I’m autistic, so I may have some different issues with it than other users. But I REALLY want to be able to freely use this again—it was benefitting me very much, before.",1,Roses24,Hope For Improvement,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,269,has_goals,557

You'd think this app would be very user-friendly, but I've found that it can be incredibly annoying. I want to be able to add goals for tomorrow and rearrange them in whatever order I want without having to press the + button, go to ""Goals,"" press ""New day, new you,"" swipe the recommended goals away every single time, and then try to rearrange my goals only for it to open up the keyboard 50% of the time or for it to do something else other than what I want to do. And if I accidentally pressed ""Goals of the day,"" I have to go back, remove the goals, and do this process all over again. Major flaws like this one make me surprised that the app has a 5.0 rating. Finch is a cute app with a great concept and mostly good execution, and clearly the choices made when developing this app are backed up by a lot of research, but using the app often ends up wasting a lot of my time, when my goal is to SAVE time. It ends up being counterproductive, and I might as well just go back to using the Notes app (boring!) if it's going to bother me every time I want to do something with the app.I recently downloaded finch, and it has been very helpful helping me get the motivation to take care of not only myself, but my house, job, partner, and pets. The only issue I’ve really had with the app is that it’s difficult for me personally to use as I don’t have a typical sleep schedule. I get home from work late, and fall asleep well after midnight, however the way the tasks and goals are set up is rather confusing if you’re like me, so I’ve had to adjust quite a bit to be able to use the app as intended. I’ve also had multiple issues of creating goals or tasks, and then they disappear from the app entirely (without my noticing, until a few days later when I realize I’ve forgotten to do something I had tried to remind myself to do.) I really do enjoy the app so far, and I do plan to continue to use it, I just wish there were an easier way to control times for days and such, as the only way to do so in the app only applies to the notifications it seems, and not goals set in the app.I really like the app so far. Three things that could take it to five stars for me:

1. Once the “energize” bar is maxed out, allow the bird to go on another adventure. Otherwise, there’s no motivation to continue completing goals once they’ve come back from their adventure for the day. 

2. Add some anxiety reducing puzzles/games. A lot of time when I open the app I feel like I have nothing to do - and I only downloaded it yesterday. I don’t want to just endlessly journal, which gets to be the only option very quickly. 

3. You should be able to put your goals for the day in order. The random order isn’t really helpful for me and doesn’t allow me to utilize this app in place of other checklists. 

Love the idea, the graphics, and a good bit of the playthrough, but I hope the developers make sure changes along these lines. Otherwise, I see myself becoming bored with the app very quickly. If I paid for a year and then could barely use it I’d be extremely frustrated. Unless I’m just unaware of t some of these issues being different in the paid version, I would recommend sticking with the free version for now. I hope it keeps getting better and better, though!The app itself is great and helpful, unfortunately it freezes on me whenever I try to do anything on it, I have to turn my phone off and on again to get it to unfreeze just to use it. Also when I’m upset and writing out why it keeps tagging random words and putting them in the positive tags, even when writing under options such as moment of vulnerability. Though it has its good too, like the guardian sponsors for people who can’t afford the plus version, which is a fantastic idea, and the pets you can hatch by completing goals you’ve been struggling with, I also like the daily rewards and new outfits, house items, and monthly themes to keep you wanting to check in and motivate to open the app.I love Finch, it really does help me complete my daily tasks, but the app is really buggy. If I press the check next to goals in quick succession, then the app freezes up and won’t let me press anything. Pressing most things at any time is a little slower than it needs to be. And yesterday, a new severe bug appeared: when I go to collect my daily rewards for the monthly event, the screen gets completely stuck on the first frame of the rewards page. No sounds play, no animations play, and the app is completely unresponsive (so I can’t just click X). The only way to get out is by closing the app and clearing the screen for it. Please fix this!! I love Finch but this is ridiculous.I liked the app at first, but I keep getting frustrated with it rearranging my goals. I put them in the order I am most likely to accomplish them and don’t want to have to search for them. I also don’t like that they arbitrarily decided to assign a 6 am start time to three of my goals…felt pretty judged for not being a morning person. Can’t say that I think I have actually done any more self care because of this app. Sometimes I manage to do some self care, but don’t have the energy to remember to check in to the app, so if you forget a day, too bad, no credit, no record of what you did. It’s not very motivating",1,someone 🦜BenTheBandGeekGesophrosuntEmma7798YumYumILoveCandy12346789,Please make it more user-friendlyHelpful with flawsReally good idea - would be great with some tweaks.Some good and some badGreat concept but poor functionalityPlease stop rearranging my goals,Finch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1036,has_goals,557

Like I’m night shift, my waking time is 6pm, sleep is 9am, but the goals will still say like ‘no coffee after 6pm’ or something like that like bestie that’s when I’m just starting to drink coffee. Also would be cool to be able to set repeating daily or weekly goals so you don’t have to go searching for them. Being able to set how many times a day you want to do a goal/be reminded would be awesome too, like instead of having to go select brush teeth and then go add it again, just select that you want it twice and set your reminders, or like drink water 8x or something like that. Also, a more in-depth tutorial would be cool. Like maybe I missed something but my bird won’t go on an adventure even tho I have a ton of energy saved up and my waking hours reflect my night shift, also how are you supposed to ‘pet’ them? I see people doing it but doesn’t seem to work on mine.I love this app! Not only does it keep me on track with goals, but it gives me a place to talk about my issues. The recommendations after reflections are usually spot-on with whatever I’m dealing with. The breathing and movement really helps me in several areas of my life. My only issue had to do with time zones. When I go between time zones (eastern to central for me), my app does not work properly. I have to revert to an older save file, which erases data that I’ve collected. This is very annoying. I don’t know if this is a common issue, but it has happened several now, resulting in me losing out on monthly items. This is very frustrating when I’m in the middle of a month and can’t recover items. If anyone knows a fix (other than saving before I switch time zones), I would love to know! The new update with the beta accounts has helped, but now I’m dealing with Reflections not saving as well as goals I’ve rescheduled.I really do love this app it helps me to get goals done that I can’t usually do but with finch it helps to remind me and makes me feel motivated to actually do things. 
While I do love the app I do have a couple of problems with it. I have seen several reviews about it being really glitchy and I thought that it was just me but now I know that it’s not. It will randomly kick me out off the app and it gets really annoying at times. Another thing is that I can’t get the clothes that I want unless it shuffles and it takes like 7 hours for it to reshuffle unless you use rainbow stones but it takes away so many of my stones that I need to actually buy the clothes. 
I really do love this app but like every other app there is always room for improvement and these are a couple of the things that would be nice if they were fixed.So, i’ve started using Finch a few days ago as a way to help me break a seven year addiction with the internet. At first, i didn’t think that the app would actually work cause i kept reverting back to my old ways on the first day of using it. Then, i decided that in order to help myself with breaking the addiction, i’d set up a schedule. When i set the schedule up, i only had a few goals and i’m slowly adding more onto my first few goals set. A downside though is that i was hoping that there’d be a system that gives you more time on your Finch’s adventure if you skip a goal during the day in order. The reason i think this should be added in a future update is to build healthy habits over time so you can at least try each goal until you’re better at it.It's a good app but there's just not enough questions to keep people engaged throughout the day. I would love to see a bit more variety with the questions as well as more little ""story lines"" with your buddy. A good idea I had: After my first day of using it, I didn't hit all my goals so when I woke up and realized the next day, I felt a little bit guilty for not even finishing. I think for new users, or for the first time a person misses a goal, a little reminder the next morning saying it's okay to not finish every goal all the time because there's always the next day:)

Anyway, little details like this would really
benefit and app like this:) I'd be happy to change my rating if more content is added!Too much critic bugs. 
Calendar doesn’t work properly. I can’t see March 14th in a calendar even when the day has been started (after 12:00am) or even when I try to plan “tomorrow”. 

Tags
Sometimes very annoying. I turned off auto tagging but it still tugs my reflections. 

Goals
When I set my goal on “every Monday”, i notice that it shows on Sunday as well. So I go back to my goals and I see that beside Monday, they automatically added “everyday”. And even if you try to delete that tag, it doesn’t let you.

So, at the end, you can’t really organize your stuff in this app. Too many tags, calendar doesn’t set up goals correctly.
Amazing idea though. I like to have my baby bird growing and if not bugs, I would really enjoy this app a lot. That’s why I give it 4 stars not less. Because the idea is wonderful and I wish developers best in fixing those problems and making organizational part less complicated. I will definitely come back to this app!I really enjoy using this app, but being a digitally challenged senior, I am having trouble navigating through the program and haven’t been able to figure out how to indicate when a goal has been achieved to get credit for it.  I don’t find it intuitive enough and I often feel frustrated with my inability to understand how to do a lot of things and I wish I could find directions that show what to do and how to get its completion entered.  Also there are things I would like set as goals for every day, but usually have to pick 2 days a week.  I would love for there to be a way to get guidanceFinch is suppose to help with reaching goals, mental health, etc.. I would say it does the job very well. However, there is something called Finch Plus?????! You have to make weekly/monthly/yearly payments to have extra quizzes and ability to have things etc. i understand that they need money to pay for the app to keep working and stuff, but if they did it in a different way I would be happy.

I can’t ever remember the strategies for panic attack relief, so with this app I just have to remember to get mud phone, open the app and go to “first aid” where all the strategies are written down. Everything is simplified and labeled with icons, so it’s easy to navigate when a panic attack or other issues have you in a spin. The goals help me keep track of what I need to do today and make it less overwhelming, and I love sending my finch sunny on adventures, she always has such cute things to say, and I love seeing her develop a little personality! I also adore that the app encourages the normalization of kindness and mental health! And hanging out with my brother’s bird is great! The app helps my on tough days, and always lightens my mood during an anxiety or depression flare up. If you are struggling or even if you are just looking to improve yourself, I highly recommend this app. I also recommend getting a hobby like singing, writing, jogging, or something else you can put your energy into and help you release your stress. Please take care, and remember that it will get better. You’re not alone😊😘Say Goodbye to stress and Hello to creating fun new habits! This app couldn't come into my life at a better time. I have a habit of putting others before myself and a good mix of ADHD I forget to simply drink water throughout the day and my health was also declining. It is always hard to stick with new small habits and this app helps me a lot! Since I practically put my finch pet ""Bubba"" before myself, I am reminded of my daily goals and what (bubba) and I need to accomplish to feel good! I absolutely love the journal entry reflections which makes the app so personal. And the best part? The one day I didn't check on Bubba since I was having a rough time, I received a warm message asking about my day once I opened the app and it felt so good someone out there.. cares. Thank you Finch!! 

Feedback: something I think would be fun to add is a voice feature that you can talk to your pet and give words of encouragement using ""we"" and can result in extra points for energy 

Also I wish I can change my avatar! I think a whale avatar would make my life complete 😂 it would be fun to choose a specific animalThis is a great and cute app that helps you to achieve an overall sense of well-being by taking care of a cute baby finch. This app helps with mindfulness and anxiety. You get points for doing simple tasks such as making your bed, washing your face, breathing, stretches, etc. All which the app suggests and you can chose from to put in your list of goals for the day. You can also set your own goals/tasks to achieve for the day. All which gives your baby finch energy to grow and go out and explore every day. There are even places to reflect and write down your thoughts. This app is free but does have an option to pay for a subscription to access more. I really liked the app so I paid for the subscription. The only thing that I can say I am disappointed in so far is it does not carry over the tasks you do not complete to the next day. I feel this would make the app even better than it is especially when you are paying for the subscription.I love Finch. Have been consistently using it for the last 7 months, and off and on for a couple of years. It really helps me with task management and introspection, plus it’s cute enough that I actually want to come back to it every day.
The only reason I’m giving 4 stars is because one of the recent updates seems to have a bug. For the last few days (maybe week), every time I “skip” uncompleted goals and set them to reappear the next day, half of them don’t show up the next day. If I go to the “Upcoming Goals” section, all the goals I skipped and reset seem to be there, but the ones not showing on the main page have less opaque/dark letters as if I’ve already skipped them again. It’s becoming frustrating having to go to this list every day and re-add the less opaque/dark goals so they actually show up on the main page. If anyone could address this issue, I would very much appreciate itFor mental health, it helps a lot. I enjoy being able to journal and reflect - which is where I have a problem with it. My reflections will mention names and the app will ASSUME I’m writing negatively about them in strange ways. It bothers me a lot because I’ll be writing about how I’m depressed and then I say my mom helped me, then in the mood breakdown the app says something like “expressed hate about Mom” like no??? Idk I think the app needs to stop assuming things like that or stop that function altogether, it makes me sad and upset to see stuff like that. Other than that, genuinely, the app is great. I like making goals for myself with it, I enjoy customizing my lil character, and I enjoy journaling with it. The first aid options shouldn’t be locked behind a paywall btw they should all be open because that stuff is really important. But this app even without buying the premium is great and I would recommend it to anyone who struggles with their mental health.I LOVE this app! The birbs are so cute and it’s so fun to dress them up and knowing that doing things I struggle with will get me rewards is so helpful! 
The one thing I don’t really like it that to add goals you need the premium version. Like, some of the goals are things I’d like to work on, but I’m not supper motivated to do, and I have to pay to add them! Personally, I don’t like to pay for self love. Money doesn’t buy happiness, even if it seems like that sometimes. I just wish that there were other ways to incorporate premium and not keep goals locked up. 
With that said, this is probably one of the best apps for struggling! I totally recommend it, just don’t be too disappointed when you need to pay for certain things (I completely understand that they need to make money, and that ads in this kind of app aren’t suitable, I just wish it didn’t lock a lot of the things it does).I love this app so much, in the like 4 short days I’ve had this app I’ve been able to function day to day a whole lot easier by setting “goals” for the day. It’s helped me because I feel kinda like a sense of attachment to my finch and I want him to keep growing and learning and exploring every day. Every night I look forward for him to return from his exploration where he tells me what he found out from the real world to where you have a chance to chose how to think about things which in turn affects his personality.

I would rate it 5 stars cus the free version is packed with things to do almost to the point where you don’t realise it’s a free version but i think it would be nice to add a few more options on the free version especially some pre written goals from the categories that are locked (at least 1-2 per category just to get a general understanding of what stuff to write)I love the whole idea of this app! There’s definitely some things I wish they would add… like I really wish you could actually chat with your little guy and not just when it pops up to chat, I’m saying whenever you need to chat. Kind of like the new AI chat bots they have lol and we should be able to put out room items wherever we want it would be way more fun to decorate that way… and now half the items to buy are locked for “premium” but that’s only been since the last update because it wasn’t like that when I first got this app 😢 other than that off the top of my head it’s a great app and helps me look forward to getting the things I need done 😊 Also now that I’ve been on here a while I have memorize my daily goals and have a routine down now which is nice and has really helped my mental health 🥰🩷 so all in all 9/10 love this cute little appI am very impressed and appreciative for this app. The free version is filled with features to help motivate anyone for sticking to a self-care routine. I have also been exploring the exercises available which I love! The only reason I am not giving this app 5 stars is because I can’t find where you can view all available exercises to link them to goals. Also, the overall layout feels a bit cluttered and overwhelming. Also, creating journeys is a bit unintuitive. I just wish there were buttons on the home screen for creating journeys and modifying any goal. I also wish the overall layout was based on time slots rather than journeys. But it’s just my own preference. I am still getting used to the app. Thanks again for creating a powerful tool for people struggling with mental illness.If you are someone like me, Finch is worth the $40/year.

I am someone who has always struggled to build habits, even basic ones like brushing my teeth. At the same time, I have always been motivated by to do lists and have always gotten distracted with phone games. This app has stabilized my world! It has incredible customization, great exercises (you can choose if you want to lay, sit, or kneel for morning stretches, how long you want to do a breathing exercise for, etc.). You can build “tree towns” and add goals to appreciate or spend time with specific people or pets. You can go on specific journeys and create goals that fit those journeys, reflect on goals, etc.

One critique is that sometimes creating goals in advance can be hard to do, the app will glitch out and think you are trying to create a goal for today. Another thing is I would like to see more customizable timers— I want a 2 minute timer for brushing my teeth!

All around, this app is as valuable as you make it. If you are goal oriented and want an all around organized and motivating place to display your tasks and feel good about the things you have done in a day… if you want a combination to do list, journal, and self-help guide… this app is worth it!I hope the developers read this: thank you. My mental state has not been good lately, and this app popped up in an ad, and I thought I’d give it a try. I’m only a few days in but I’m starting to see a little glimmer of light. This app is wholesome and simple. The goals are small enough that I can accomplish something and feel a little better. So thank you. Thank you for give me hope.

Edit: if you’ve made it down this far, you are loved. I have made it almost 2 months using this app. I just got my husband using this app. I cannot tell you enough how much this app has really helped me to change myself. There’s still a lot of work for me to do, but this has been one of the best things I have ever done. I love you. You are awesome. Make this your time.I’m going to start this review off by saying that I. Love. This. App. It gives me the motivation to take care of myself, no matter what. It’s been especially helpful this summer because sometimes I feel like there’s no point in being productive without school. But there is one issue that annoys me to no end: you have to set goals on specific days. Say I want to do a certain goal once a week. Finch makes me choose what day of the week that I’ll do the goal on, so if I go for a walk on a Monday but the goals set on a Thursday then I won’t be able to check it off that day. I wish you could set goals that had to be done a certain amount of times per week/month that pop up for the whole week/ month. Sorry if I’m wording this weirdlyHas significantly improved my mental health in the short time that I’ve been using the app. It’s very rewarding and I love that it’s free! It’s such a great app and it’s free!!??? What the heck!! I don’t have any complaints. It’s very thorough but not pushy. Whenever I’m feeling low, or anxious, I go to the app to find a healthy coping mechanism to get me out of a funk. It makes me feel much better. It has a little spot to reflect after tasks/goals (washing my face, drinking water, pretty much whatever goals I chose to complete for the day) but you don’t have to reflect if you’re not feeling it.  I am not a person to leave reviews and I am very unbothered leaving one for this app, if that tells you anything. Thank you for everything, finch creators!! :))I rate this app 4 stars because it is constantly checking up on my and giving me the support that I need. When I was going through a really hard time in my life this app really helped me get up in the morning. I had little to no motivation to do anything for awhile, but I got this app. I really like how it rewards you for doing the things you need to do, and you can set goals for yourself. One thing that I think could make this app better is making less things for the premium subscription. I really feel like you should not have to pay for a better self care experience, and I would really appreciate it if less of the finch experience comes at a cost.I absolutely love this app! I love my finch and seeing them grow! This app overall has really helped me create a good morning routine, as well as really work on my self-esteem and caring for myself. I started using when I was really having a hard time mentally and it has really changed so much! My main criticism is that I think overall it could be organized a bit better-I know a few people who got overwhelmed w figuring out how to decide what to add to their goals, and I also think the goals could be grouped together better. I also keep having an issue w the meditation timer! Those things are so minor though, compared to how I feel overall! Great job to the cool humans who created!Overall I love the idea behind this app and I’m having a great time. I do wish it was a little easier to get to the Goals and Reflections pages (it takes a couple taps instead of being right on the front page) since that’s what I mostly use this app for… Maybe that’s not exactly how this app is designed to be used, though, lol. I use Goals mostly just as to-do lists for my day, and I like using reflections like a journal to organize my thoughts. I really love the keywords system and how it analyzes the impact tags have on your mood. That’s probably my favorite feature. Would be cool if you could set certain Goals to reoccur on a daily or weekly basis.normally i don’t write reviews for apps, but finch is genuinely such a good one. 

a lot of mental health apps similar to finch never worked for me, because if i didn’t check in for even one day, the tree would die or the flower would rot or something like that. i hated it because i could never miss a single day, and the systems werent very forgiving.

finch isn’t like them at all! you don’t get “punished” if you don’t check in. you get rewarded when you do! you can create your own goals in the free version, which i love.

i'm constantly doing my silly little goals so my silly little bird can have a silly little hat i find cute.

HOWEVER, there is one thing i wish this app could do. i wish SOME goals could “roll over” into the next day. of course i don’t need to shower three times, but if i forget about laundry, i would like to be able to simply do it the next day instead. if possible, i would greatly enjoy the ability to make the goals “roll over” into the next day if they aren’t completed.This is the perfect apps to keep up with your daily things and goals! I love how along with keeping up with things, you get to take care of your very own bird. Something I am confused with though is the birds clothing. I’ve clicked the little clothing button in the corner, but it takes all the clothes away and when I try to get them back, there is no way too. Now I am not able to put clothes on my bird. I don’t know if this is a mistake in the app or I’m just not finding the button. Overall, this app is great, I just need to know about that minor thing. I highly recommend this app!I love mental health apps that are engaging like a game. It does actually help me feel like I’m taking small baby steps for my mental health for when I’m not meeting with my therapist. So it’s nice to have something like this as extra personal support for times like in the moment. But just to mention why I rated 4 stars, I kind of think that there should be goals or tasks that require speaking responses instead of texting or maybe even video responses so that people wouldn’t cheat their way to leveling up their pet and still being able to work on their mental health.Hi, I have been using Finch for a while as a blind person. This means that I use a screen reader (voiceover) to navigate technology. Because of this its extremely hard to find a selfcare app that is accessible. When I first downloaded Finch it was completely accessible and for the most part still is. Except for goals. In recent updates voiceover can not navigate the goal immages and I am not able to complete any of them. I hope this can be fixed. Regardless if it can't or can this is still a very amazing app that I will continue to use. Just wanted to bring attention to the problem.I’ve been using this app for less than a month and my mental health has gotten even better!! You set your own personal goals and age up your own little finch, you get “rewards” to dress up and customize your finch and it’s adorable and so helpful! The extras aside from the goal are great!

The ONLY downside is that some things require paying for premium and I personally, and I don’t think I’m the only one who feels this way, can’t afford and don’t want to pay for this premium version.

I love this app though and definitely recommend this to EVERYONE! You all have mental health and you all need this app!!☺️❤️Hoping for more features, like maybe activities that our Finches do with is, like if we start a workout goal or a breathing exercise, our Finch does it too with us. Also, longer chats with our Finch, maybe? More customizations are always great! And it would be cool if there were games we could play in the app like how “My Talking Tom/Angela”has to earn extra Rainbow Stones. Play dates with friends would be adorable An option to speak the goals for young kids who can’t read yet, or more accessible for some adults maybe? Just spitballing ideas, really. Hope it inspires the developers! 🖤🖤🖤This is app is the best! It has helped me so much and even just in a fun way! The only thing I don't like is that premium is so money. I don't have it, but from the things I can't do without it, it seems worth it! lf I had premium, I think I would be doing even better with some things like how without it you can't have goal suggestions for all the catigories etc. I think it should be free, or you earn it somehow like by achiveing goals or something because their are so many people with so many reasons that they can't get premium.I’ve only been using the app a couple of days, but I would be interested in premium. The problem is, y’all advertise it’s “only $3.31 a month” or whatever, but lemme guess, you do not offer a monthly plan. Everything has to be paid up front. So if you want to appear honest to your users, maybe like…I dunno, make it $3.31 a month? 

Things I like: the graphics, UI, and goals are my favorites. I like that you can drag the goals to move them around. I like the colorful hashtagged words. The journey section is great. There’s no ads that I’ve seen so far, so that’s always a plus.",0,MadKat55AlexisOrcaHunterwillieS@rc@sticÅcemissnoodle2002Ajkrivin420jebHuny❤️BehindEyes92cringecompirlSylaethussloanethedogwhaetthinzkenzaroooooooRaeFunkmayanightstarAhejjqhdkdkajzjcke+_+lunas.luxury+_+Kenzie SullyMy little brothers sisterOli StupkaRavenAddamsLilianna Miksonmsronzio,"This app has helped me so much😊Helped me mentally and physically!Great app but needs some tweakingBug in an update but otherwise love this appAlmost perfectI love this app!Best app everSuper cuteVery ImpressedWorth itThank youPLEASE update goalsGreat for anyone!!!4 starsLove my Finch bird!Really good, could still improveabsolute banger, but missing somethingPerfect app but something to change/need help withI really like this and I only just started using it today. :)Almost perfect.Amazing!Super CuteIt's great but I don't think it should be money for premium.Adorable, pleasant app",Finch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care Pet,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,24,0,0,3691,has_goals,557

I, like many other people, would benefit greatly from having these features, but because it’s locked for normal users, we don’t get it. I understand that you need to pay your bills n stuff and it’s really hard to do so sometimes, so I’m not mad, but it would be nice to have at least stamina breathing for normal users. Other than that, I find it nice. It would be nice if there were more examples for prompts, but they really help when I can write out what I need to. The breathing exercises help with anxiety and insomnia, which helps because I’ve suffered from both for the longest time. Thank you guys for the amazing app ❤️ please at least consider my requests if you could
Edit:
I love this app and it’s really helped me with everything as I’ve said before and I got a recommendation for this app. Maybe add a SH timer and education to help fight urges for it, and of course if someone gets triggered by it they could turn off the feature. I don’t know, but people could definitely use the help with that because they are unable to do proper research themselves, of course just a suggestion ❤️I first started seeing this app on tiktok and I thought “I’ve tried these before and they don’t work.” But then my friends started telling me to get so I finally caved. At first I was a little confused and didn’t really care about the goals but the more I used it and the more my finch grew it became part of my schedule. Now I check the app around 30 times a day to say hi to friends or complete challenges or just check in with my finch, Freckles. One thing I thought might be cute, is if there could be a chat feature when sending Good Vibes. Now, this may be stupid and maybe it’ll just be another platform for cyber bullying but maybe y’all could tinker with that idea. Another thing I thought is if you have friends on finch we could be able to set up play dates between the finches, in which you could get one play date a week or a day or something and your finch could travel to where the other finch is and have a “play date”. It would be the same as adventures in where you would have to wait for a certain amount of time then pick your finch up and collect gems. I don’t know, but I thought it might be cute! Anyway, I love the app!!!I had downloaded another mindful “journey” app and forgot to cancel after the trial. I couldn’t do anything on that one without adding the full subscription and then this year was hard and I fell out of using the app and wasted a good chunk of money. 

This app is NOT like that! I have the free version and I feel there is enough there to keep it that way, but it is also worth it to subscribe (and I will if I can keep up on it). I do look forward to unlocking stuff with a subscription one day- maybe when my other subscription expires. It is really amazing to see all your goals of the day go into raising your cute, little bird and it motivates me to do small steps so that it can grow and go on throughout the day. I also really enjoy that the team’s birds come and interact from time to time. 

Highly recommend it (whether you can subscribe or not) and I look forward to checking in daily and seeing where this journey goes. You’re doing great!To start off, I really love this app. I’m a huge procrastinator and this really helps me get things done and better myself, I would totally recommend this. However there are a few things I would like to see changed. First of all, the app tends to freeze, lag a lot, and kick me out though I’m not sure if that’s just a problem with my phone.  Also I would really like it if I was able to rearrange my goals more easily because they are often out of order and putting them in the right order is rather tedious. Finally, I’ve noticed that the smart tags don’t always work. For example, I could write a reflection but nothing will get tagged. I try to manually tag certain words, but still nothing happens. I know these issues are small and I can still use the app fine, but I would really appreciate it if they were fixed.I thought it was kind of cheesy at first, something i’d lose interest in a week or two but it seriously makes my daily goals a lot easier to keep track of! It’s probably been around a month and I feel like I’ve not been so productive or motivated in a while. It’s also a convenient way to track how long I’ve been on a “Journey” to better myself. I have a few started and I’m doing pretty good :)

Edit: Probably almost a year later? i wasn’t using it for a few months, but once i picked back up again after a few months of little self care, i started to take care of myself again. There’s just something about this app that gives me enough motivation, and it’s easy to lay out plans and goals for the day! Cannot recommend enough to at least try this app.My mom got a recommendation for this app by my school counselor for me since I have anxiety and possibly OCD. The only thing is, and this is my fault, I forget to check off goals as I complete them so at the end of the day my screen is like *click* *click*. Another thing that might be helpful, maybe for non premium members you could make the soundtracks go a bit longer because I don't want to keep restarting them 😅But this app makes me feel like I have a purpose for completeing goals and not just mindlessly scrolling through a to-do list. Because there is so much more to do on this app and it honestly makes it seem more like a game with all of the activites you can do! So, that you developers for making this app because without it I'd litterally be lost.This has app has been so helpful. In 6th grade I got really depressed and completely forgot how to take care of myself. I slightly remembered how to after things got better but nothing was really helping that one thing I needed to remember. I found this app and downloaded it expecting nothing good. That's a lie. I'm speaking for a friend on this part but we have both been helped a lot by this app. I have 3 goals that I think others should have. Water, shower, and eat a normal meal. I love how rewarding this app feels to complete even the simplest tasks. I love the anxiety stuff on here. That has been something I've struggled with for years. Thank you app creators for helping me and so many others. This is an app that will never leave my phone ever.I can’t believe it’s taken this long for someone to come up with an app that exploits my addictive tendencies for my own good.

It can be exploited, of course. Nothing is stopping you from lying. But when used correctly, this has all the dopamine of Animal Crossing or Neopets but instead of wasting your time, it motivates you to help yourself. I also love how it forces you to pace yourself so you have to keep coming back.

Developers: PLEASE keep developing this app. With more goals and collectibles and more things to customize. I want to use this for the rest of my life. This is the first time I’ve really had hope that something like this might actually stick.This app has helped me so much since I downloaded it. It’s gotten me to a more peaceful mindset and it’s been much easier to do things that make me happy. The only issue I have with the app is that while I was going through the goals for the day and I was completing the ones I have done so far, the app froze and when I got off the app and got back on, the app has flashing bright lights and the screen was flickering at an extremely high rate of speed. I personally wasn’t bothered by it but for the people that are epileptic and using this app, this bug could cause them to have an episode and go to the hospital or worse.I’ve tried a bunch of different apps that are supposed to help you build habits and stuff like that. It would work for a few days and then I would just stop logging on. But this app? I have been logging on every day without fail for the past few weeks and completing goals every day to help my little birb grow. I end up doing things that I had no intention of doing that day just to be able to send her out on a little adventure. If you are struggling, please give this app a try. I promise you it is so much easier to care for yourself when you view it as taking care of something elseThis is a cute game where I can learn to be positive, plan my day, and at the same time grow something that I influence. This finch I raise is like a child that you care for and teach life lessons. 

Definitely recommend, but if you are not depressed or have anxiety or don’t like growing stuff, then this game is not for you. 

As for “finch+”, I am not sure it’s worth to buy since the features are the same, but it gives you more variety in things like quizzes, soundscapes, reflection, goals choosing, etc. It’s explanatory, but I think the finch plus should have different perks, for example: mini games for finch (no ads).I had this app for a short while. The goals are nice, the bird is cute, and I love that you don't have to pay to use it. The idea of going in adventures is amazing, and you get to teach the bird things when it asks. I'm a person who easily gets attached to animals and plushies, so when I set so many tasks that I got lazy and stopped trying to complete them, I felt like I was failing my little buddy. I ended up getting rid of the app because of this problem, but it was a me-problem, not a problem with the app. So I suggest this app, it's really great for self-improvement.I thought this app would be something to remind me and reward me when I did my daily goals (eat a piece of fruit, exercise/go for a walk, get more than 6 hours of sleep, etc) but it’s not. Although it would be helpful if they added those things, it has actually helped me even more with positivity and great questions to reflect on. It’s not forced either, which makes me want to do it more. It’s done in a really cute and beautifully subtle way that I don’t even realize how much it’s helping me until I feel better. Bravo little Finch!I’ve been using the free version of the app for about a month now, after my sister suggested it to me. I have to say, daily goals became much easier when I found out that you could list them in focus and they would autopopulate instead of typing them daily. The little finch is adorable and I do find myself finishing tasks just to get those prisms to buy clothes. Not sure if I feel the need to even try the paid version since the free one works so well, but maybe if the paid version allowed two finches I would :PWhen I first saw the app, I thought it was going to be stupid, but I got it anyway. I struggle with finishing goals and getting out of bed on some days. When you have some sort of reward (even if it’s just virtual currency for your bird) it really motivates you.

Now, when I say this, I am not meaning that this app should replace or in anyway outweigh professional help. I can’t get a therapist in my life at this time and having an app that shows different breathing techniques all while always building you up positively is absolutely fantastic.So I love the way finch is designed- I use it for daily tasks, motivation, etc. But with the recent update for the micro pets, I complete my goals for the day, and collect the daily item, but the next day I have to collect the same item and it doesn’t go to the next day. It just repeats and has been for the last couple of days. It may be just for me, but there may be other people with that sort of problem and I wanted to notify the finch team about this new update.

The way I use it is to stay focused on my very day tasks. So for instance, I can get pretty overwhelmed really fast especially since I have a physical disability, and I can’t stay focused to save my life. I start a task get distracted, and start a new one, so if I’ve been cleaning all day, but I never stayed focused on a task, it will seem like nothing got done. So on my app I have my entire day planned from start to finish. From the moment I wake up, get out of bed and brush my teeth, go do my tasks get ready to sleep and do it all over again. It’s literally all on the app. Now I’ve set everything up on my Journeys to make sure I’m keeping track on my process. My issue is that is that I can’t seem to get them to pop up on my goals for the day in order, so I have to sit there and move everything around to get my day started in order. I know it’s not a huge deal but it is time consuming and I get overwhelmed and distracted while moving everything around. I would really hope that in the future they could make it as in the journey goals for the day can have an order system for those of us that use the app like me. I think it would really be a game changer, instead of having to write down each day to get them to come on the goals section in order. That is literally my only issue, but again I love this app and I’m grateful to have it in my life!I’ve tried a lot of self care Apps, and I mean A LOT and have quickly felt unmotivated and lost interest in every single one of them.. until Finch. This is the most customizable and rewarding self care app with goals and journeys that you can edit and cultivate specifically to match your needs and wants. Getting to see your finch grow and Learn about themselves is so much fun and makes me excited to check in every day and send my finch out on an adventure. I love being able to choose my little ones colors, and outfits, and decorate their home, which keeps me motivated to complete task and earn rainbow stones to buy more stuff! If you need a friend to get you through and keep you motivated then I 100% recommend Finch! Plus the 2 seasonal events I’ve gotten to participate in so far have been so cute and fun. Ps: There is a free and paid version and the free version is 100% functional and add free. You really only miss out on a few features but nothing that ruins the app not to have. The paid version opens up the remaining features like various reflections and quizzes and stuff. I had Finch for 1 month before I paid for a year because I love it so much ($40 I think for a year 🤔 can’t remember). Coming from someone who never leaves reviews on ANYTHING this app is worth the time and if you choose to pay it’s worth the money. Finch has seriously helped me change my outlook and is something I look forward to every day.I got finch with my sister and we haven't stopped using it for the past 3 months. Even if you don't always feel motivated to complete goals, it is nice to write in your reflections/rant about things. I like that you can view trends about certain people or even what brought you down/motivated you throughout the entire week. My finch is named DJ. He is so cute and I just love dressing him up. Besides the app itself being enjoyable, I think the team of people who work on Finch care a lot about it. You can tell they genuinely want to help people get through their days. This can be seen in the inclusiveness of the app and the lack of ads. There are no ads on Finch, and it makes the app less frustrating. The only thing you can purchase as an expansion to the app is Finch Plus, which gives you extra goals, reflections, and quizzes. Even then, the app never bombards you with in-app purchases. It jsut really makes it more comfortable for people to log in daily even if it is just for a few minutes. Also, like I said, Finch is very inclusive. You can change pronouns for your finch or even dress it up in pride flag themed clothing. Which by the way, the pride clothes are not just labeled as ""bisexual shirt"" or ""asexual shirt"" They are named by the colors so that it is more inclusive to everyone and have safe names for lgbtq+ people to buy. My #1 feature that I enjoy is seeing the mood trends i have with particular people in my tree.First of all, I would totally recommend this app, graphics are amazing and it puts highlights which makes you understand what you have done that day, even in the free version you get 0 ads and it’s honestly amazing. Another good thing is that when you are doing like these rain sessions (you hear rain) is that when you get out of the app it still plays !! Like music !! Honestly that is absolutely amazing I was shocked because I thought you had to be in the app to have it playing !!  Also the finch is just so adorable honestly. I also love how you can make them non-binary. I also love how they respond to peoples reviews, I honestly never see that anywhere, very amazing to see they listen to their community.
Here’s the small problem, when your picking your goals if you don’t have the payed version it just gives you random ones, which that is completely fine but, when I was setting my goals for today yesterday it mainly only had options like “give someone your car space” or something like that, most of them were related to cars except I don’t have a car license nor 
can get one either. So I think it would be nice to make a bit more variety, not remove them of course for the people who can do that, if this is not addressed that is completely fine :D just was a small problem, but genuinely would recommend this app for everyone :)Suggestion: Please consider giving higher rewards for scheduled evening goals? I’m motivated to complete tasks earlier in the day. But once your energy is full, the rewards are minimal. My nighttime routines are the most important for me personally, and it would be helpful to have more motivating rewards. Eg. higher rainbow stone rewards for goals completed after you fill your energy, or for scheduled evening goals. 

Review: I love this app! As an adult with ADHD who struggles to prioritize taking care of myself, this is so helpful. It has the dopamine boost of a game/rewards, without the distractibility of an actual game. It’s very helpful to externally motivate me to take care of myself and basic life tasks, eg drinking water, listening to my body when it’s hungry, taking my meds, taking time for myself. 

Suggestion 2: I only wish the free version was more rewarding. Especially for event rewards, the non-Plus needs to have a few more guaranteed items and less random chests towards the end of the event days. I ended up just paying for Plus because I wanted the additional daily event rewards and options of clothes/decor to serve as motivation for me to stick with my goals. And I understand the developers need money to help them continue to run such an awesome app! But I do wish the non-Plus was slightly more rewarding for events / had more options.This app is an excellent hybrid combination I have really enjoyed. It combines the ability to create to-do/task lists (shout out, fellow list-makers!) while incorporating self-care. It offers encouragement, wisdom, space to vent when needed, goal suggestions that help you grow, learn, and practice compassion along with productivity! You can additionally set personalized long-term aspirations, or, “Journeys”—the bigger picture things you’ve been meaning to improve or adjust. These are tackled over time, as they are broken down into manageable steps. Frequency of the bigger picture goals on your journey can be adjusted/tailored to your pace as preferred. I love how expansive the possibilities are. There are genuinely so many functions within the app to appreciate. Overall, it makes each day special and provides manageable steps that establish personal/work/life/school/family balance! The options that open up with a paid subscription are fantastic—however, do not despair! The free version has a wealth of options that provide genuine benefit as well. This is an app that takes all of my list making apps and self-care apps and combines them into one power-house, versatile, and very special app. Give it a try at the very least, because folks…it has maintained outstanding 5.0 star reviews for sound reason. Be well, be kind, and never stop growing.So- a while ago I downloaded an app called Daylio, it’s like a virtual journal to write about how you felt that day, to be honest that app didn’t really work for me. Then I came across this app, I immediately got intrigued because I love birds (I mean LOVE them) I downloaded the app to try it out and it just… got everything right. So for all you possible downloaders lemme explain what this app got so correct. First, your little companion. Idk about y’all but self-care is hard for me for one reason, I have really low self esteem so taking care of myself isn’t always on my to do list. But your little finch pal depends on your taking care of yourself, that way it isn’t ONLY for you. Second. The atmosphere. This app really seems like some sort of game, you get rainbow stones from completing goals, stretches, anxiety relief methods and more. Then you can use said stones to purchase clothing and items for your finch. Third, and lastly, personality. YOUR FINCH HAS HIS/HER OWN PERSONALITY! I don’t know about you but to me that is freaking adorable! My finch likes corn after eating some on my first day using the app, on his first adventure he heard “Baby shark” and now it’s one of his favorite songs! Last night I even caught him dreaming about Baby shark! ITS SO CUTE! Anyways, if you’re looking for a good self-care/goal setting app, you might as well give this one a try :DI am in love with this app and I’m grateful to have seen an ad for it on TikTok! It actually helps me to get what i need done, helps me stay motivated, set goals for myself, and achieve them! Its helped me to better my life while keeping my attention on my goal and the app so i dont lose motivation or focus! This little bird you raise has all sorts of questions about the world, every time you complete a goal he gains energy to then go on an adventure, with the more energy you gain the quicker he comes back home with various questions about the world. Your little bird will gain various likes and dislikes based on how you answer his questions and I love seeing how he changes and grows, seeing what he likes and dislikes, and even customizing my little bird and his house. These things help me to keep the app around and actually use it while completing my goals. Have you ever had someone tell you to treat yourself for completing a goal? Answering my bird’s questions and seeing him develop is like the treat for me, it keeps me tackling my goals and feeling good about it. Not to mention, sure, there are things you can pay for that would be cool to access, but the free version (since i do not have the money right now) is great by itself! I love this app so much, thank you to the developers for making this, i’ve never found an app more helpful!This app has literally changed my life. I have wanted to put the work in to better myself for years but was never able to get the motivation for it (it’s often very hard to get motivated to do stuff because I have adhd) I saw an add for this app not sure if it’d even help me out, but gave it a try. 123 days later and I still check in every day. I drink water daily, go outside, focus on positive things in my day even if it’s just one thing. Helping my little friend (their name is Poki) grow and learn new things has been the best motivator for doing things that I often have trouble with. My mood has improved, I’m getting chores done around the house, I went to the doctor for the first time in years. There’s always something new and it rewards you for completing your goal and doesn’t penalize you if you don’t complete all of your daily goals. It’s exciting to come back each day and see what new things your pet will learn and getting to watch them try new things and travel. I log on every day not because I have to but because it’s something that I want to do. I am forever grateful for this app and all it has done for me. I look forward to how much farther it’ll take me. If you are debating getting this app and giving it a try I highly recommend it. Good luck on your self care journey from Poki and myself.Every day when I wake up I check on my finch! I got to take a shower and brush my teeth as well as wash my face and do skincare to make her go on an adventure. The adventure usually lasts 8 hrs but you can reduce the time by doing more of your goals and rating your goals and taking about ur day! It’s makes me actually do things I don’t normally want to do like clean my room, make my bed, get out of my bed, and have a productive day until I started using g finch! It helps with stress, if you just need to be cleaner or more productive, helps you stay on task and keep doing what you don’t normally want to do, and much more! After every adventure your finch tells you about what they saw and you get to tell them what it is that they saw!!! When they sleep you can tap on them and it shows what they are dreaming about! They dream about what they saw on the adventure. Also, not to mention the ADORABLE micro pets! I have an obsession with llamas so I immediately got all of my family members to accept my requests so I could get the llama of my dreams!!! There is so much to do! If you have stress or have trouble taking showers when your supposed to, keeping your room clean, brushing your teeth, skincare, or if you need to relax and find a new adorable and great app that actually works, use finch!! I love it! You defiantly won’t regret getting this app!!!I’ve been able to share Finch with some friends and have something that makes me check in on myself, something I neglect to do more often than not. I’ve already subscribed to the Plus plan, but I think it’s important to note that it’s not necessary to have the Plus in order to get those self-reflection tools that neuro-divergent people so often forget or let fall to the wayside. The SOS features are incredibly helpful, in addition to creating the small goals for yourself that you can find being necessary but giving you a sense of accomplishment. I can say that I have been able to be more conscious of my actions and feelings using Winston (my Finch) and I’ve even been able to use Winston to help me talk to others about my feelings and actions, because I want to show my Finch off! This is the first app I’ve stuck with to help my mental state and it’s been amazing. The developers are responsive to any questions and/or concerns, which is incredible. In the future, I would like to see a feature where we can share our data in a report format via a doc (without any identifying PHI, of course) with someone - my therapist would love to see the progress I am making since we don’t meet in person very often because of the pandemic. If I could send her reports via a doc in an email it would be a wonderful addition to the app!I had seen this app in the store before but had never downloaded it. When I finally did, I didn’t have high expectations of it being something I stuck with. It looked lovely, but I knew how I was and could not see myself sticking with something like this. I’m only about a week in, but I’ve used the app every day since I downloaded it. I’ve turned to the app when I was stressed or upset, but I also turned to it when I was happy. I noticed that I used to spend a lot of time on my phone, endlessly scrolling, and now I’ll open finch and spend time doing the exercises. I like that it feels like a game. The more I talk about my feelings, do breathing exercises, take care of myself, and achieve my goals, the more I earn stones and give my pet energy. It’s a win win. I don’t know if it would work for everyone, but within a week, I decided I wanted the full version and signed up to pay for a year. I could have kept it and gotten use out of it with the free version too, because it really was designed beautifully. But because I loved it so much, I simply wanted to pay to get more awesomeness. It requires the drive to heal and learn and grow, but if you’re someone who is remotely self aware and interested in making small changes at a time to improve your life, you could benefit from this.I’m so thankful for this amazing app and its supportive community 🫰I have tried like six different planner/habit tracking apps this year and Finch comes out on top! It’s cozy-cute little environment is less stressful and overwhelming than other tracker apps, and Waffles, my bird, keeps me engaged with the app and I check it on my own without reminders (and with reminders bc i added a few :P.) I love that every time I open the app it asks me about my mood because some apps limit the mood selections to once daily- which quite frankly just isn’t realistic. I use the free version and I LOVE IT. It doesnt limit the apps functionality (which I’ve seen on free versions of certain habit apps- one even limiting you to THREE GOALS A DAY unless you pay for it- not cool.) I’ve only been using it for a week, but I will certainly willingly pay for the full version once Ive created a secure habit out of using the app. OH And the fact that you can “sponsor” someone else to have the full benefits of the app? Literally so sweet, I cried when I first saw it <3 

My current suggestion is to allow you to see certain reflections from people in your friend tree. I like to reflect about my sister and would love to have the ability to toggle showing her my memories about us growing up together, and it would be nice to see what she thinks of me!This app has really helped me better myself every day and it is so relaxing to just go home, get my chores done, and hang out with my baby(now toddler) finch and talk about my day, i also love the little notifications the app sends you saying things like baby *blank* supports you it always makes my day. My friend who does not have an apple phone has this app and can still have the widget which I think is cool. I also love the soundscapes, and i love all the cute little outfits and stories you can do with yours finch and how it will send you a notification in the morning saying baby *blank* is awake and ready to see you, it really encourages me to get out of bed and complete my goals to energize my finch for their daily adventure. OH! And the tree town, you can add your friends and family to the app and add them to your tree town and send them little messages and if you talk about specific people or things it will keep track of that and help you realize “are these things positive or negative in my life?” I also like the little quotes and the little questions you get asked when you open the app, but i do wish that i would not have too pay to get access to things, id honestly rather have adds if that’s what it takes. But other then that I absolute LOVE this app so much!This is one of the most amazing games in the WHOLE WORLD!!! My favorite thing about it is that I get a little pet birdie that I can take care of every day! Plus there was one funny part where a member of the Finch Team came and sent me a hug. I wanted to send back gratitude. Guess what Sugar (my finch) said? “Should I go over to (whatever her name was) and thank her for existing?” XD!!! Idk why it just sounds funny to me! Wait a second… I just realized I just started typing a long story and not getting to the point! Ugh, that always happens when I’m writing reviews and making descriptions of Scratch projects! That reminds me, I saw make a Scratch project on goals. I’m pretty sure you put that there because I didn’t put that goal before. Wait… I’m doing it again!! I’ll just tell you my suggestion. So, I want there to be a bookshelf and you can buy books, and then you can read them to your finch!!! They will sometimes argue when you choose a book they hate, and maybe fall asleep during the book. If you do one they dislike, they will become bored and have a small chance of arguing. If they like it they will be interested. If they love it and it’s their favorite they will be super exited!!! Can you try making this update please? Thank you for reading my tremendously huge year long comment! 😅( IN CASE YOU DONT WANT TO READ THE WHOLE REVIEW: this app does really help. Id download it if doing stuff like taking a shower seems like a chore.) I’ve only had this app for a couple hours, but it’s already helped me improve so much! Like, showering used to be a chore, but today when I went to take a shower I was fine with it and got in quickly! I think knowing I would complete a finch goal really helped. But like I said in the title, I’d like them to add some stuff. 1) I’d like more pronoun options. The pronouns- although they are for your finch- can represent your pronouns! But there’s only three options. I think adding a custom pronouns spot would be great so you could put in custom ones. Another thing I’d want is being able to repeat goals every- hour as an example. For things like drinking water, I don’t want to make one goal for every hour. So to add hourly reminders would be great! Id also like more mental illness quizzes. I downloaded this app because I have (self diagnosed) ADHD and I wanted to take a quiz on it through the app but there was only anxiety and depression. Although I still did those two and they helped me figure stuff out, I’d still like more of those quizzes(and not behind a paywall). Overall this app helps a lot and the things I want aren’t needs. :)This app has helped me so much. A few years ago, i stopped taking care of myself and completely stopped brushing my hair, brushing my teeth, washing my face, and it got really really bad. I started getting matted hair, and when i went to the dentist they said i was developing gingivitis. My acne started getting worse, and i would constantly be on my phone, rarely taking showers and stuff. My depressive episode was really bad and took over my life. I heard about this app through TikTok, and decided i needed to start taking better care of myself because i’ll be going into high school next year, and would like to stop being the weird girl with yellow teeth. You can set your own goals, and dress up and name your finch!! It’s adorable too!! You can choose a name, choose pronouns for them, and raise them too!! My little basil is so sweet and i love them so much. Basil has really helped me, and since i’ve downloaded the app, I’ve started getting back into a  healthy routine; of taking showers every other day, brushing my teeth at least once a day, and washing my face before bed. My anxiety started to worsen, so I added some goals to my list such as do 1 breathing exercise. This app has helped me so much and i’m so glad that people made it :) thank you so much for helping me through my mental health finch team!!I absolutely love this app! This is my second day of using it, and I fell in love with it! To be honest, Bailey (my finch) is so cute, she motivates me to do my goals! 😂 I love how this app makes things like cleaning your room fun and easy! I am currently using the free version of this app, and unlike many other apps that are available free but there is a plus version (like duolingo), this one does not press you to get it all the time! I really like that it’s also like a game, being able to age your finch and dress him/her/them up! If you’re reading this review because you’re not sure whether or not to get the app, then take my advice and download it!!! It’ll help you a lot! Also, if you get something at the beginning telling you to pay, don’t worry, it’s just offering you the plus version. Click the X in the corner to get started with the real deal, not just naming your finch and things like that. They also do fun events! I’m typing this during the Halloween event, and it’s adorable! You can have your friends get the app as well, and you can use friend codes to add them on the app. (You know the app is good when I’m a kid and take time to write all THAT about the app). Overall, this is AN AMAZING APP!!! I hope the developers see this, so they can be proud of what a good app they’ve created. ❤️This app seriously has everything. I love the different soundscapes, and they even have a meditation timer in here. They have a lot of different journal prompts, and a lot of them are things I wouldn't have thought of. I like the way you can visit your friends, and even add people to your town that you just want to keep in your thoughts, or that you love. I love the goal setting and tracking as well. The quotes that begin each day are great. there's even a place where you can write daily affirmations. I like the ability to rflect on the joys of the day also. It's those little things that lift you up so well. There's different quizzes to track your depression, anxiety, etc. It will even guide you through various exercises, (although that part doesn't work the best for me as a voiceover user.) And everything earns you moonstones which you can buy things with. And you get to do all of this while taking care of a baby birdy and improving yourself and her life as well. I am so impressed with this app each day I use it. I think it would rock though if we could see what our friends' goals are and send them good vibes when they achieve them.  There's still more in this app that I haven't mentioned.This is genuinely an excellent app for people struggling with self care (for various reasons, prominently depression and ADHD), it motivates you to complete your goals with the most adorable little bird (whose colours and pronouns you can choose!) You can adjust the app according to your bedtime, and each time you open the app, it asks for your mood and respectively the app will give you different features (such as exercises and affirmations for the morning, breathing techniques for a better sleep at night, rant when your mood is bad, write positive thoughts when you’re happy, so on) and also has different features to help you feel grounded in case of a panic attack or an anxiety attack. there’s a variety of ways to regulate your emotions, including exercises and journaling your thoughts accordingly. of course, there are in app purchases but the paid features are less than half of the features and they don’t really interfere with your process of using the app, it’s definitely just to support the app. overall, great app, fully recommend to anyone struggling with self care. 

also, to the devs, would definitely recommend allowing users to customise their pronouns, mainly for people who use a mix of pronouns and others who use neopronouns! other than that, great app.I have been in a rut lately and have no focus and have been struggling to do things and be positive. I’m stuck at home a lot, don’t have many friends to see during the day because I live far from them, I have a lot of hw to do and I work and especially the hw part I keep forgetting to do it or having motivation. Having adhd doesn’t help that either. The other day I forogt I had an important quiz to take and was so upset with myself. I have just been feeling frustrated lately. I also don’t talk about how I am feeling I’ve never been that person. So when I got this app and I saw there is places to reflect and write about things I would normally keep to myself made me feel a lot better than I thought. The little bird I named caju which means cashew is so cute and makes me want to keep doing my goals and keep reflecting on myself. It made me realize I need to keep myself happy and calm and that everything will be good. This app has helped me see my goals and want to complete them. One of my goals was as simple as”drink more water” and I actually did it because it made caju come back from exploring 😂. I love how many things there are that don’t make you feel pressured to do them, it is just there to help🥰🥰🥰🥰I signed up for the free trial of premium and forgot to cancel it before it charged me $40 for the yearly subscription at the end of the week, and honestly I’m not even mad. I have tried countless self-help apps, read books about it, gotten physical notebooks, made lists, calendars… I can safely say I have tried everything. I saw this app on TikTok and figured I’d give it a try because it looked like a unique twist on another self-help app, but didn’t expect to use it for more than a week. Some days I don’t use it, but they’re few and far between. I love that I can make as many goals for myself as I need, and there’s no ‘penalty’ for not meeting them but there’s a higher reward for completing them the more often I do. It’s silly to think all I needed was the motivation to get fake currency and decorate a fake birds fake house, but it really works. I have all reminders turned off because I hate having too many notifications, but I’ll get a notification once in awhile that just says something like “I believe in you, cheep” or “you’re doing great” and I just love it. Couldn’t recommend this app more to anyone who needs a self-help app, or is just bad about getting through their to-do list. I never write reviews, but this app really deserves it.Finch has helped me from motivating me to doing things that I need to do and what I want, you can make your own goals too! One of the reasons i love finch; I want my Finch (LJ) to grow and get smarter, and if she grows and gets smarter the more things I do that are helpful in my life. When your done with a task you press the check mark button on the task bar. You can buy furniture, clothing, and more! Every task you do you get gems! (That’s how you buy stuff obvi) but overall this is A 5 star! My life is getting better from this app. There are no adds either! I hope you choose to download this app it will help a lot. (Also, you can take a quiz for anxiety, depression and more, but if your results are negative/ there so high that you need help they will suggest things to help you!) this app is such a life saver! All the other apps like Finch you need money to start. I think that’s selfish! But Finch has no charges unless you want premium. The apps that do charge (not just apps like Finch but apps like helping you with screen time)  (to put it down) will charge but finch is free!!! I LOVE FINCH! (Also if you like the book “Very Hungry Caterpillar” I suggest you be care full when your finch is done reading it. And they talk to you about it. Or else they will dislike it!)I absolutely love this app! I often struggle being able to get myself to do simple things like getting out of bed, changing clothes, eating, etc because they seem tedious and exhausting (even though they’re very necessary), but now, putting these as goals and knowing that my little penguin will benefit from me accomplishing these things has been very helpful! Since I know it’ll also benefit my penguin child, the basic routine things that must get done eeeevery single day don’t feel so dull and like a prison of life.

 I would just like to suggest something! If possible, could you add like a section for a countdown timer with a ticking sound (or allowing for sound to be optional, maybe, for those who prefer silence)?? Compared to other apps where you grow a garden or something, like Forest, I actually care about my penguin enough to want to spend time focusing so he can get some benefit! The reward for staying focused doesn’t need to be huge; just an incentive to use the timer! Honestly, even the growing of a garden actually gains my attention in this case, because it would be my PENGUIN’s garden! (Can you tell how much I love my penguin? 😅) 

That’s all! The app is great! This is just a wish that I believe would be super helpful for me for focus! 😭💕I almost never write reviews for apps, even the ones that I like. Normally I’ll just tap the 5 stars and be on my way, but for THIS app, I make an exception. I have never really been one for these sort of self-care apps, and then I found Finch. The premise of the app is that by taking care of yourself through completing the goals that you set for yourself through the app (i.e. Brush your teeth, make your bed, take 15 seconds to breath, etc.), you help to raise a “Birb”. This happens by you being rewarded for your efforts in the form of energy and rainbow stones. There is too much amazing content within the app itself for me to delve into, but there is another thing that I absolutely must sing this app’s praises for, which is that while the app does have a premium version, the free version functions in almost the exact same way. The features available to you through the free version are still incredible resources for you to help yourself be better to yourself. While there are obviously benefits to the premium version, the app is still INCREDIBLY effective in its free format, and it does not block you with a pay wall.

A genuine thank you to the Finch dev team, because this app is legitimately helping me to be a better version of myself. ❤️I have been in the process of self growth and dealing with depression. This app was recommended to me by my sister who deals with anxiety/depression. I have to admit this app changed so many aspects of my life. The goals I have set for myself are based on my feelings for the day. I also appreciate that there is a way to see where negative and positive reflections occur. I used that tool to identify some of my problems in my work-home life and then created a new journey to improve my work-home life. I have gained so much more confidence in myself because of the affirmations I am able to write and by answering some of the questions related to confidence. I am using this app to also help in my weight loss journey, which is a super difficult process, but Finch makes it so easy. I actually get excited to cross off my goals, even if they are related to working out, which I normally hate doing. I use this app every single day with multiple members of my family and I can’t imagine not having it. I even got into the breathing and meditation exercises, which I used to struggle with understanding how they are helpful to mental health. I now see amazing benefits.  I highly recommend this app for anyone struggling with anxiety/depression. Spread the word about this app!!I love that this promotes so much reflection on all aspects, and the tagging/goals etc keeps it all organized in a way that I can look back on and learn from without the counter-productive stress of coming up with a system /enforcing it myself. I think it's helped a lot in just a few days and I definitely would like to get the plus subscription when I can afford the year-long package. The main critique I have is that I wish whenever a new tag was detected for the first time, it would automatically pop up the tag editing menu to categorize appropriately rather than assigning the best guess, and it would also be nice if we could optionally categorize positive/negative/neutral. Reasoning for that being, for example, when reflecting on a poor mood I might say ""but X person made me feel a bit better!"" and then the app associates that person with negative moods even though it was a positive reflection, which affects the summary/graphs usefulnesses in that regard. Or maybe something like a ""silver linings"" section where you could put positive reflections even within negative mood periods. Otherwise I love it so far and it keeps me engaged in a way that other self care apps haven't been able to. Thank you Finch! ❤️a very sweet app with a cute little pet. I love the concept of watching my little guy grow up. the breathwork exercises were helpful and it’s nice to have a place to write down my thoughts. I also like that it doesnt pester me when I miss my goals. this bird is genuinely better than my therapist. little dude I love you 💕💛💕…however, I dont like the quotes the start screen gives me. they feel like fake motivation / toxic positivity sometimes, and I think that the “start day” screen doesnt really need them. they arent harmful or anything just unnecessary and a bit annoying. 😅 I do however appreciate the notification quotes, its nice to see “you can get through this” pop into my view while I’m scrolling. ☀️would it be possible to add a feature for daily affirmations? I know its always an option for me to just set it as a daily goal, but it would be amazing to see a function for it. no obligation though, I know you’re busy people. and this would be a neat thing to add to the plus version. I don’t currently pay for plus but adding a few more nice features on plus would be incentive for me to buy it I think … 😅also, would it be possible to make it so the”chat with him” button doesn’t wiggle so much? it makes me anxious hahahThis app is so amazing. First off I would like to say I think it’s very cool that the time you can spend on the app is pretty minimal, once you complete certain tasks, so you aren’t distracted by it all day like other “games”. That being said, it does really help set a positive tone for your day through motivational quotes. It challenges you to complete “simple” goals, which can sometimes trigger a spree of productivity— and at the very least, you can be proud to have accomplished the “small things”, that maybe you weren’t having the easiest time with. It acknowledges that sometimes we do not even think we can get out of bed, and it provides support, and motivation related to self-care. The collection of reflections are thought provoking, and help regulate emotions and keep grounded without being irrational even on a bad day. And on bad days, they encourage you to vent. First Aid feature is incredibly important and helpful, teaching ways to overcome anxiety, panic, etc. Anyways, the app is totally worth it even in the free version, but I’ve tried out the premium version and I must say it is absolutely worth the money. Oh and I’m an adult but I do enjoy decorating my nest, & changing up my finch’s appearance. Lol it’s so cute. Get this app.I have done finch for over a year and if you are trying to do a quick habit like taking a deep breath or drawing something every day, I highly recommend finch. I am really attached to my birb Apricot❤️🐣 I do finch every day and it is really motivating because if you miss a lot of days, you’ll miss the best event prize. I don’t get why there are so many micropets though. It is also very inclusive with many different pride flags and shirts. I sent an email asking if they could put the agender flag, and I’m not sure if it was from that or not, but it did show up, which makes me really happy to have that representation. I would very much like the aroace flag, these colors:🧶✴️🦷🚙🦕. Thank you! Finch is also great for best friends or significant others because you can send your birb to say hi to theirs. There are many options for what to say. I bought finch plus for $40 a year, and I think it was worth it. You get access to so many more things, but finch is really enjoyable without as well. I use plus for more soundscapes, meditations, and more event items. There is no limit on goals or journeys without plus which I appreciate. I have had a lot of success with Apricot (my birb) so far. Thank you finch team!Firstly, Im honestly awful at making habit and sticking to them, but i find that Finch kept me coming back everyday. 

However, there is ONE thing that makes me anxious. Althought you make slow progress day by day, i find myself getting closer to finishing exploring the forest. Im worried that once its over ill lose my motivation to keep checking in. The discovery and likes/dislikes are really such a key highlight of what gives my Finch a personality and keeps me wanting to continue to check in! Im hoping there is another area to explore after, maybe once you finish the forest you go onto another location, if thats true then ill happily say theyve went above and beyond expectations! I will update this review once i find out!

Aside from that hinderance that is worry-some to me, this app has been a live saver for me to vent to. I can keep track of myself with goals and track my moods to see if maybe i can find repetitions or things that may cause my decrease in happiness. As i mentions before, im awful at keeping a habit going but ive checked in to finch everyday for 2 weeks so far and i didnt think i would for more then 2 days! This application captivated me, truly. Best self care app ive tried. Yes, download it!!The first thing that made me kind of happy when i heard of this games was that the title was finch! I have recently named myself finch and seeing a cute little mental health bird who is a finch made super excited!! Not only that I also love the fact you can change the name and pronouns at anytime! My pronouns are always changing so seeing that option i was stoked! I also enjoy how motivated this app has gave me. When i checked the daily goals option on there I immediately did them later in the day and felt so good about myself! I also tried out the stretch feature and I normally never do stretches or any sort of yoga but afterwords i felt great!! every muscle felt nice and relaxed. Lastly i really enjoy the breathing exercises, especially the anxiety one. I struggle with social anxiety and that breathing exercise was super helpful! the only thing i would change is i would like a bit more options for the daily goals or at least be able to make your own custom ones. I cant get plus because i can not pay for it and i would like other options like ‘read a book’ or ‘clean my room’ those would be super helpful but other than that I recommend this to whoever is reading this!i genuinely love this app so much. i’ve recommended it to so many people in my life that people think i’m sponsored by finch haha. the app keeps me motivated and i love the idea of raising a finch along the way. i love that you don’t have to pay for the helpful features and the app works completely fine while being free. i enjoy having a place to reflect and just rant, plus the prompts they give are nice. i also love that you can choose your focus so that finch recommends certain goals for you. plus the anxiety breathing honestly really helped me get through tough times. i feel like this app really does a lot and the people i’ve recommended it to (that actually use it) all have good experiences as well. some even use it more than me which makes me so genuinely happy. i really never write reviews in general, but i feel like i just needed to thank the game developers for this. this app gives me an outlet to write things out and reflect on my emotions all while feeling productive because i’m raising a bird. i’m not gonna say an app cured all my mental issues, but it’s definitely made life at least a little easier. i would 100% be an ambassador of finch haha. anyways, thank you. i love this game. :))i never leave reviews on stuff but this app has been literally the best aid i’ve found to decrease my executive dysfunction and mental disorganization. i have adhd and it’s really hard sometimes to stay motivated to finish tasks or remember to do routine self care tasks like brushing my teeth or taking my medicine, and this app has both given me the motivation to get stuff done so that my little guy (his name is Pepperoni ♥️) can adventure and grow and get new clothes/accessories, and it serves as a great reminder to complete tasks i might have forgotten about. as i think of a new task i need to finish i add it to my goals so that even if i forget later on, i’ll be reminded by the app. and there’s nothing better than seeing that clear goals screen at the end of the day!! the little encouragement notifications throughout the day are so sweet, and in my opinion it’s 100% worth it to upgrade to the paid version if you like the free version! (i paid $40 for a year-long subscription, i feel like i’ve already gotten my money’s worth and it’s only been like 2 months lol) i could say so much more but i’ll just say one more thing: if you’re considering it, download it!! 💫I’ve never had success with self-help/self-care apps because once the novelty has worn off I can’t stick with them. However, Finch has kept me hooked for over a year. Taking care of the little bird really does change how you view self-care. Since my experiences shape by bird’s, I’m more aware of my responses and tend to try to focus more on the positives than negatives. Plus, the purity of my bird’s worldview is endearing. I like that the app has guided journal questions and tracks your moods and the goals and journeys are great. I’ve been wanting to get the premium since I love that app so much but it’s an expense I can’t quite afford. However, I haven’t gotten tired of the free version. I like the emails the Finch team sends weekly - it’s clear they really care - and the little visits from staff birds. This is one of my favorite apps and I think it has helped me. The only thing I would suggest is adding a water tracking section. I’m sure I could make it a journey but it’s the one habit I’m really struggling with right now and I haven’t been great at keeping up with it when setting goals each day. It would be cool to have it built right into the app.I don’t know what else to say but wow. I didn’t think an app like this could exist. There’s everything on it! You can customize your finch and its room, and even though there is a currency, it’s super easy to earn it so you’re not missing anything. They offer reflection prompts to write your thoughts down. They give you exercises to ground yourself, to remain calm, breathing exercises etc.. They have mood check ins every now and then during the day. They have motivational quotes whenever you enter the app. They have a huge collection of goals for you to set and accomplish. And you know what’s rad? There is a subscription but Finch is in no way pay to use. You are totally good on the free subscription, which is so great because I keep on downloading self-care apps unknowing that most of the juicy content is blocked behind a paywall. Thank you so much for this, Finch. This is what really gets me to consider getting the subscription. It’s overall such a wonderful app. It’s not a chore to do the reflections and complete the goals and I actually have fun :)

I do have one suggestion. Can you guys consider adding a dark mode? I tend to use Finch at night and the graphics are really bright.I have loved this all so far, and have been using it for about a month. There’s so much that’s available in the free version and since upgrading I’ve found it even more helpful. The “First Aid” section is amazing for moments of high stress and anxiety. The goals are really helpful too. It’s perfect for helping me manage my stress, anxiety, and depression, especially because I’m taking care of my little birb when I take care of myself. Somehow that makes it much easier to complete the tasks. 

One thing that I think would improve the app is if the user were able to create their own goals to be saved as suggestions, just as we are able to remove suggestions (which btw is one of my favorite features as my family and I don’t speak much and I can remove any suggestions related to that.) 

Overall I think this is amazing, that’s just one area of improvement I see. I know you can add your own goals to the list, but I would prefer to be able to add some of my own goals to the suggestions - maybe even a category for “personal” goals where the user creates them? It could be another category only added when you subscribe. Anyhow, that’s just my thought.Ok so when I got that app I really wasn’t expecting to like it that much because of the other apps like these I’ve had before. But when I recently got the app I fell in LOVE. I love how it had a little bird partner that I’m looking after, there are also many “breathings” to help you with anxiety, to be calm, to sleep and some more! My finch also helps me get up, drink water, and be active! When I’m feeling down finch makes me feel better when I go on the app to see that it asks how I’m feeling if I’m feeling bad it puts some questions or a FREE anxiety quiz not like other apps and a calming breathing stuff like that and it asks me why I’m feeling bad. When I feeling good it asks me why I’m feeling good it let’s me set some goals and other things! When you do your goals/tasks it gives your bird energy and other stuff like reflections to reflect on how that helped or how you feel after it and it gives you gems to buy clothes for your bird:). And yeah the plus does cost money and I haven’t bought it yet but it still gives you so many other things without it and that’s what I love so much because of how many options it gives us! So I’m gonna just say.. GET THE APP YOU WOBT REGRET IT!❤️❤️I don’t even know where to begin. As someone depressed and usually left alone, this app is a lifesaver. It’s so nice to have something to care for and love; someone to talk to and vent about your day to. It has a lot of amazing features that you don’t even have to pay premium for, like soothing rain or forest sounds, personalized goals you can set, and quizzes to monitor your stress levels. Every day you can check on your little penguin friend and send them on an adventure, and it’s always something unique and inspiring. You can guide your little penguin through life, just as they can be there as a stress reliever. This app is honestly turning my life around. My dad recently passed, and I’ve had a hard time coping. It used to be hard for me to get out of bed, I would sleep for about 15 hours a day, I used to stress eat in the few hours I was awake, and I was gaining a lot of weight. I just started using the app about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and it’s already helping me. I set little exercise goals, intervals to drink more water, and reminders to go outside and get some fresh air. It’s been helping me so much, it’s unbelievable. I’m still in awe just writing about it. Literally life changingAfter having Finch for a year and utilizing the app every month, I can say with confidence that this is definitely THE best self care app and it genuinely helps!! I struggle with depression, and it makes simple tasks like getting out of bed and even feeding my dogs difficult. With no appetite, I couldn’t even feed myself, so I’m underweight. I felt like a bed-ridden disappointment last year about to give up my dogs, and now I’m itching to get out of bed to wash my face and feed my dogs every day so I can get on Finch and make my girl Mushroom proud. Finch is helping me eat more and makes my journey to gaining weight feel like a fun game instead of a chore thanks to its option to make your own journeys. I have to add, I recently started exercising and I had every reason to be lazy today because I’m so sore, but even then I was itching to complete my daily goals! I feel much happier and productive and it’s all mainly thanks to Finch. It has so many wonderful tools to utilize to start making healthy habits that will better your life and wellbeing. I also appreciate the constant updates that actually improve the app! The Finch team is absolutely incredible, thank you guys!I’ll admit, I downloaded this app initially because I love birds. Like many others here, self care apps never did much for me; they felt superficial and I could never continue on for more than 2 days. However, there’s a calming charm about Finch that just brings me back everyday, wanting to achieve my goals and hang out with my pet (Cocopuff). I also fell off from journaling for a couple years as it felt too personal - I didn’t want to reminisce on my sadness through writing - but here I am everyday, just casually writing down my thoughts in this App, and wow it really helped bring clarity to my head. The design of this app is truly brilliant as it got me attached to Cocopuff, and furthermore attached to self care in a way. The breathing exercises for different situations are extremely helpful for me as well. Thank you guys so much for this app. It’s funny how moving even a small notification like “Hope you feel better, cheep” from my “pet” is on a random bad day. I will be subscribing yearly soon as I’ve never used a self care app for so long! Please continue updating your Instagram too, the art is absolutely wonderful and the content is helpful.Hello! I am a teen who has recently suffered from morderte depression. I’ve been using this app for a month now. I first heard about it from my friends. I thought It looked cool so I downloaded it. It’s a little hard to hard to navigate at first but once you get the hang of it, its sooooooooooo helpful and fun. I love this app because it helps me be happier wile also making it enjoyable to do😃!  I have a few ideas that would make it better though. if I could easily check a calendar then you could click on a day and it would show all of your goals, that would be cool. Also maybe you could have like when you save outfits, it also saves the appearance or like color of ur finch to? Thanks. Also FYI I am not paying for the premium version bc I’m cheep/broke but the free version is actually rly good. I have NEVER had a self care app that had a good free version, except for this one. Like, MOST of it is free. This app is rly helpful and can also keep track of your goals. I like how it gives you suggestions of goals or like, writing prompts. I have noticed myself feeling better and more energized sense I downloaded this. Anyway, thanks so much for this great app!❤️I have been working with CBT/DBT in therapy for the past couple years to help lower my anxiety, boost my mood, and raise my self-esteem. This app has the grounding techniques, breathing techniques, and stretches that I need to help manage my anxiety in one space. As well as being able to vent by journaling and having a space to make goals for myself. They also have a really nice variety of soundscapes to listen to whenever I want to do that. I particularly like the household ones like the washer/dryer and cats purring. That’s more soothing to me than an ocean sound but they also have that. I personally struggle a lot with keeping up with any form of self care including my own hygiene when I’m going through a rough spot mentally. Having an animal, your bird, there to cheer you along and getting rewarded for those goals that you accomplish really makes it fun to even do stuff as boring or difficult to do as taking your meds or washing the dishes. This is one of the only apps that I actually pay for the premium and use all the features. I also like that I can add friends to my tree and visit their birds with motivational or comforting words.I have tried so many apps for both my mental health and productivity. I have also tried so many different methods of journaling but none of them ever stick. Finch was the first app I’ve ever made it to the one week mark of using it consistently. Usually it stops after 1-3 days, but I’ve been using Finch consistently for over a month. It genuinely helps. There’s always new things coming in and I often see it as a game. I literally forget that I’m being productive. I love how easy it is to compare the days of the weeks. It helped me realize what was bringing my mood down and I’ve been able to change habits to make my life better. It definitely has room for improvement on the technology side but it’s so good I would still give it 5/5 stars.

The specific things I would want improvement on are the following: Timezone change glitch, an easier way to locate previous days’ reflections and future days’ goals (this one might just be me not being able to find it)

Overall though, I could not recommend this app enough. I literally tell all my friends about it and I won’t shut up when I do. 🤣I’m a minor and I love this app! It’s been exactly what I’ve needed, it’s an app that’s genuinely seems to care and provides free services, the birb is adorable and truly feels like a companion, it helps me recenter myself and complete goals that I usually can’t, it makes it addicting to commit tasks and reminds me what to do for the day. The fact stories, and you can dress up your birb makes it like an accomplishment doing simple everyday tasks, if you have poor mental health this app slowly can get you back on track, this also can even work for parenting, needing a schedule, or other reasons you’d need to organize, it works for more then mental health. It’d be very useful when school starts back up, or when you need to complete something for work, this also keeps you on track over vacation. You’re able to customize your goals to your schedule and lifestyle, the task could be as simple as drinking water to as hard as working out for 2 hours! It’s that great, I have no criticisms, this app simply just makes me feel better about myself and keeps me on track! Absolutely amazing for anything and everything.I’ve never written a review for an app before, so trust me when I say it’s amazing. I saw an ad for this and assumed it was just going to be another “Self help” app but its useless and riddled with ads. Finch has No ads. There is a subscription service but the app works perfectly without it and it’s not necessary. A lot of apps want you to make goals yourself or they set unrealistic goals for you. This app has plenty of goals that are easily attainable such as, Get out of bed and brush your teeth. Which for some people feel impossible, and finch understands that. You can also set your own goals and they have breathing exercises and so many helpful recourses. You can also name and dress up your little bird. Overall one of the best apps on my phone. If you are struggling and you’re thinking about downloading this Please just do it. It has helped me so much <3

I do have one issue, I cannot choose the order my goals show up in. So brush my teeth in the morning is towards the middle, get out of bed is towards the end, etc. If there was a feature that could let you choose the order the goals are in, it would literally perfect :)I am loving using Finch. I use it to manage daily tasks as well as bigger and longer range goals, but also it helps me keep up with self-care when I am managing and juggling too many things. Further, having the game/virtual pet aspect is appealing to me and helps keep me engaged when I feel anxious and overwhelmed and just want to give up. This is why the app is so effective for me, it is cute and sweet, yet helps me do hard things and keeps expanding my capacity to be more organized and effective in my day. I think Finch is also great for anyone trying to replace some unhealthy coping and anxiety management habits with healthier ones. For instance if you play games or shop to manage stress, you get aspects of that in this app, but you are using “rainbow stones” instead of actual money and you earn them by taking care of yourself and journaling and creating healthy habits… I could say more about how the journaling is like CBT lite, and raising your personal virtual finch feels like it could be used as a way to do some self re-parenting work… But you should check it out and see for yourself. Highly  recommend!  💗This app really does work in positive ways to motivate me. It really hits on my personal love for cuteness and rainbows. And As a middle aged woman, I don’t mind it’s childlike cuteness.
It has so many amazing features even in the free version that I don’t feel underserved by not being able to afford the subscription, but instead want to save up for the very affordable fee because I know it goes to help others in the same position as me. 
 I love the breathing activities, mindful mini journaling (my therapist always recommends this, but I rarely take the time for pen and paper) the little positive quotes make me smile, customizable goals help me with big and small tasks that I would otherwise neglect or put off, soundscapes help me mellow out, my Finch’s adventures give me little moments to giggle, and the weekly reviews help me reflect and grow.

I actually share a lot of my Finch’s  quotes and stories with my blind best friend, and she finds a lot of positivity from the interactions too. I have doubts that the app would be accessible for her, so we just talk about it via text. Someday we may try it just to see if Siri could handle all the choices.Seriously, are you struggling to set goals? Finch will help you pick goals based on their prompts, or you can add your own, your little bird guy gets energy from you completing them, and a chance at rainbow stones as well. Struggling with wanting to journal but not being able to keep up with one? Finch has your back with journal prompts that help you think deeply about your experiences and feelings, and get energy for your bird. Struggling with anxiety? Finch has breathing exercises and ambient noise for you, and using them gives your bird energy. Wondering about your mental health? Finch has quizzes to help figure out where you might want to focus. The premium is cheap for what this app has done for my mental health, I’m in love with the way it takes you through a process of healing when you’re upset. It may start asking why you’re upset, then encourage you to dig deeper, than prompt you to take a step towards healing whatever it is that’s bothering you. I recommend this app to literally anyone, but neurodivegents especially take note, turning your self care into a game is life changing.I love this app it’s genuinely really helped me get out my thoughts and feelings. I love how your penguin is like your own kid and you can watch it grown up and that depending on how you respond to it, it gains different aspects of its personality. 
Some things I think could be added: more clothing/accessory items you can get in the shop, having a button to add how your feeling (with the series of smiley faces that you get with the quote when you open the app) — having a button like that be available at all times; because sometimes I might be feeling one emotion when I open the app and then a while later i’ve feeling differently but it doesn’t let me choose how i’m feeling again because I already had recently. 
Also: a bug a found was that sometimes when I postpone a goal to the next day, the next day it doesn’t show up on the actual page, but I can only see it if I go in to add more goals to that day. (I know my wording is probably confusing sorry 😭)
But overall this app is really amazing and it’s great how much you can do and have access to just with the free version.This app is really, really helpful. I recommend it to everyone I can think of. The free version gives all the options you need to do the important things like setting short and long-term goals and checking them off. The paid version is very affordable and gives you all the cute options, as well as full customization of things like icons for goals and some more of the pre-made options. 

If you’re looking for a simple way to organize your thoughts and keep yourself organized, while working some self-improvement in there at the same time, this app is amazing. I’m on day 100-something and don’t plan to stop any time soon.

Honestly, the only feature I’d appreciate that this app doesn’t offer is a calendar setup. You can set things like weekly, monthly, bimonthly, etc goals, but you can’t, for instance, say you have an appointment or want to set a goal for March 3rd. There are ways around it (like setting a goal and then snoozing it for an amount of days in the future the following day), but it’d be helpful at times to have a true calendar built in.I’ve been having a hard time the past few years, and that only worsened with the pandemic. This app hits a sweet spot of helping yourself while helping a sweet angel baby adventure and be the cutest baby you've ever seen. I’ve always been the type of person to customize Sims, their personalities and their houses for hours, and then losing interest in the storyline from there. So, being able to design outfits for my Muffin and choosing answers for the adventure prompts to help guide Muffin to be a lovely lil finch has been so heartwarming on its own. But that’s not all!!!! Being able to push myself to answer short journaling prompts (my ADHD makes it hard to focus in on journaling consistently) and create realistic goals (I also struggle with trying to do the most possible and then feeling like a failure when I don’t get everything done). My partner has noticed a big change, and is super grateful that I found this app. Also, my therapist loves the app and recommends it to other clients as well now. I’ve yelled about it to everyone that will listen at this point. 10/10, highly recommend.I’ve been struggling with self-care for forever and this app has honestly worked better than therapy. I have successfully washed my face, brushed my teeth, flossed, showered, and done laundry every day for 9 days now. I have a touch of the ‘tism and this really tickles my need for schedules as well. It alerts me gently when I’ve scheduled something and it is no punishment to skip a task. I feel no shame if there’s a goal that I just couldn’t get to that day. The breathing exercises are an amazing addition and I use them frequently. It really does feel like a pet that cares about you. I have gotten to the point that I do these self-care goals before the app reminds me, even forgetting about the app temporarily until I realize I’ve done my goals out of habit. 

Literally the only thing that I would change, more of a “tip” to the creators, is that it would be really cool if the notification on your Lock Screen said the name of your pet and had their little picture instead of it saying “Finch” with the logo. 

I would, and have, recommend this app to any friends or family that I feel could benefit.10/10 on this app. I download apps like crazy from adds and things, so I’ve tried numerous self help apps. I always seem to feel like the goals are sometimes to much of an obstacle and never seem to complete any goals and inevitably deleting the app. This app I’ve only had for a day but I love the goals it has for me. As I do suffer from man ice depression and am disabled from SJIA, things like brushing my hair or going outside are more of an obstacle some days. So for this app to give me a chance to actually feel like I’m doing SOMETHING even if it is baby steps (which I am always saying is how I move haha). I am truly grateful to the creators of this app. The time and effort you put in is astounding and with a 5 star rating to back you. I applaud your work and to your team I thank you all.

Update: I’ve used finch for almost a year and am still in love with it. I can’t afford plus but they make it so easy you don’t even feel like you don’t have a premium feature. There’s so much to do and so much gratification in feeling like I’m getting things done. Thank you so muchFinch is such an amazing app, i rarely buy any “plus” or premium to apps but finch is definitely something i do not regret. i am checking in daily or even several times a day on finch to reflect, do breathing exercises, or completing goals. i love getting to dress up my little penguin and chat with them when they come back from adventures! i love how you can add friends on this app. one of the only things i would add to finch is an option where you can send personalized messages to a friend. there is an option to send “good vibes” to your friends and there are many different ways to do so. but occasionally it would be nice to tell my friend something a bit more specific such as, “good luck on your presentation today!” or, “i heard you were stressed about (blank) me and (blank) are here to help you!” but other than that finch is a must-buy. it had already helped my mental health and encourages me to get tasks completed. i love to check the daily shops to see what cute outfits i can buy. so, if you are deciding on weather to buy this app i think that you should definitely give it a try!In a frenzy to help myself I downloaded a few different “self help” apps all with generally similar goals. This one is the only one that I religiously began to use. I like the prompted goals it gives- things that normally I would not
think to take time out of my busy day to do but ones that really help (breathing deeply, drinking a glass of cold water, splashing water on your face, etc). At night, I usually lay in bed and check off the things I did, and then work on some of the prompted exercises for the evening- reflection of what made me happy that day, talking about my friends, planning tomorrow, doing stretches, listening to rain sounds. There’s so many to do and they’re quick and easy but really make a difference in my mood levels and stress levels. I also utilize the “journey” options, which introduce prescribed goals daily for an overall change you want to make. As a free app, this is gold. It’s fun to use, easy to follow, and I really feel passionate about its purpose. It feels similar to having a Tamagotchi- if you’re old enough to remember those, but it’s taking care of you.I love this app! I HIGHLY recommend it. It has tons of options and it’s very customizable, especially when you have the premium version. You can have seemingly unlimited journeys and goals for each one. I’m not sure if there’s a limit, as I have about 6 or 7 journeys. You have pre-made goals or you can create your own, which I think is wonderful. Even without premium it’s totally worth it! Finch is adorable and I love that it develops its own personality based off of choices you make from its adventures. You can dress up your little birb and share the app with friends. You can send good vibes to your friends, like hugs, water reminder, calmness, strength, etc. It motivates me to actually do things and take care of myself. I don’t rate or leave reviews often, so this app is quite special and I truly love it. It gives me a space to reflect upon things and I love that there are many prompts and questions to answer. Definitely get it if you’re hesitating! I never pay for apps either and I have the premium version. It’s entirely worth it to me and I will keep paying for it. Great job developers! 🥰I first saw an ad for Finch on Tiktok and usually I just swipe past the ads, but the app looked really cute and the comments under the ad were all very positive, saying how it was really helpful to them, so I decided to give it a try. I've really only had this app for a week or even a little less than, but I'm so glad I found this app. It's amazing, there's so many features and they're all so helpful. The features I found that worked the best for me were the goal-setting features and the assisted breathing techniques. I also love how the app gives you the sort of feel of a regular phone game, allowing you to dress up your finch with clothes and accessories. Because it has that game-like feature, it never feels like a chore to me to get on the app and complete goals and reflection. I tend to get easily bored of new self-care methods I try, so this aspect of the app is very captivating for me personally. I've shared this app with my best friend, boyfriend, and sister and they all like it a lot as well. Definitely try out this app if you have the chance, it's so helpful and honestly just so cute lol.I first got the app when a friend asked me to so we could be friends for tree town. When I first got it I was like “I’m probably gonna use this app for a day and then stop” I was so wrong. I have been using the app almost everyday multiple times for a month. I love my bird Cloudy and my favorite part of the whole experience is when your bird comes home from exploring and shares something with you. Having the ability to bond and grow your bird definitely helps motivate me to set goals and do tasks for myself that also help my bird. This app is so wonderful and your tasks become adjusted to how you say that you feel which is great. I have used the app so many times and I love it. It’s a great experience overall and I like how it’s fun but also beneficial to yourself. The app won’t pressure you to have a streak or anything which makes using it a better experience for the individual. I highly recommend this app to anyone trying to improve their mental health or trying to understand themselves better or even just trying to have healthy habits. It’s all here in this app. 5/5 Stars for sure.I absolutely adorable this app! I love having my bird with me everyday and learning more about them as the days go on keeps it exciting. This is an incredible app for staying on track for your day to day tasks in a fun way! I love the friends feature too!! It has certainly helped me stay on top of my goals. I no longer feel behind in anything. I love all the features that come with it! Only thing that I suggest though, the selfcare tab of the overview of the days where you can see all the goals, your reflections, exercises and the interactions you did each day youve been active on app, I wish there was an option in that menu to organize what you can see. Somedays I want to be able to just see my reflections I wrote each day. Other times I want to see just the goals I completed that day or the goals I didn’t complete. Not all it once that I have to do endless scrolling just to get to a certain day. I hope you can update this to make it more customizable. Other than that I seriously love and appreciate this app! Thank you so much!Self care app with real world impact immediately!  If you didn’t make your bed before, now you will!  The shop and adventure mechanics keep you invested, doing little acts of self care and journaling all day just to make sure you get those new shoes for your Finch… if other self care apps haven’t worked for you, I’m willing to bet this one will!  Even if at first you’re just checking off boxes trying to get through the goals, you’ll find you’ve journaled more than you may have ever thought possible!  Finch saves your responses as one continuous log that you end up looking back at more than you’d think, learning about yourself from yourself through a bird that is constantly growing up and also learning who they are through their own experiences and opinions.  Like come on, it’s great!  Just download it, give your Finch a name and see if you aren’t checking in on your new friend constantly!  If you’ve made it this far then I highly recommend the app, I truly think if anyone finds themself on the app more than once they’ll benefit in real ways!I have been suffering from SEVERE Treatment Resistant Atypical Depression — and, honestly, this App has been helping my mood and my outlook more than Counseling. I had a great Counselor for a year, but the techniques she taught me didn’t really mean much any more when my medication quit working.😞 With the Finch App, I look forward to taking care of the cute little bird (thus “myself”) — and, while it cannot necessarily fully treat or cure a severe Major Depressive Disorder like mine, it provides GREAT advantages: For example, the interactive aspect and questions provide both a 24 hr. “anytime” access to a reduction in the amount of loneliness and isolation I feel, AND promote a sense of “self-value” which motivates you to adopt a relatively more positive attitude. I think this App would be FABULOUS for children (which it “can” be modified for) to build their sense of self-worth and self-esteem. I, also, think this App might have the capability to lift “anyone” out of a very mild feeling of depression. No matter who you are, or what your goals are — with the right attitude, it can definitely help you !I’m in love with this app. It really helped me be more productive and achieve my goals. The whole concept of starting a journey and having goals that get you to that journey is what I’ve been looking for in other apps but have yet to find it. Also, it is super motivating to complete the tasks because they either give you energy or rainbow stones. It is also really cute to have a pet to take care of. Plus, if you’re not able to complete a goal, you can skip it and if you talk about why you skipped it, you’ll still energy / rainbow stones. The quizzes, reflections, anxiety tips, ranting, soundscapes, breathing exercises, etc. have been super helpful and I am so glad I downloaded the app. Love it so much! I am going to tell my family about it!

However, there is one thing I would add to it. I wish you could choose the order of all the goals so that I can start and end my day in the order I need to do each tasks. Therefore, I’d feel more organized. So if you could do that, that’d be great!

Overall, I’m so happy I downloaded it. 10% recommendThis app has helped me a lot to ground myself and keep me focused on what matters.  The activities and encouragement that Finch offers, from what I've seen, draw on techniques that therapists and the field of psychology recommend.  On better days I just use it for my to-do list, completing the tasks to send your bird on an adventure is very satisfying for those with ADHD (or other dopamine junkies).  On hard days it gives some comfort, and it's a great way to track my mood consistently since it does that every time you click into the app.  I love the recent update that lets you customize goals and journeys better!
If I could recommend one thing it would be that the first aid kit be customizable as well.  I have a list of things that help me most when I'm having a meltdown and most of them aren't on there.  In those moments my mind goes blank and I can't remember any of them.  If I could add them to the kit I could remember them better and it could be part of my Finch self care.  That'd be awesome.  Thanks for all your work on this!I was recommended this app by a friend on a disability based discord server. We both have ADHD and struggle with motivation, and he said the external rewards from the virtual pet helped him a ton. I’ve had it downloaded for a week and it has been super helpful. 
The goals are very flexible with how you can set them up and I appreciate that immensely. I also found myself liking the reflection feature way more than I thought I would. It’s like a much more casual version of a diary, with optional prompts. I used to hate these kinds of guided reflections but the prompts are super open ended and lets you to write very casually and unorganized. 
The lack of negativity and punishments is *so important* in a self care app and there isn’t any kind of punishment for doing poorly or not using the app for a while. Very glad this app takes the right approach of not punishing people for struggling to take care of themselves.
My one complaint is that the UI is a little tricky to navigate. It can be confusing to figure out how to access different screens that are slightly different.this is the first time i’ve written a review for the app it’s just that good. i’ve been in a lot of therapy but it’s hard to keep implementing what i’ve learned. finch provides cute, comforting positive reinforcement that motivates me to overcome my depression with behavioral activation, a cbt tool where you tackle depression by starting to do the things u stopped doing bc u were depressed. at first i was just brushing my teeth and showering and finch gave me the little reward i needed for completing those tasks. i gradually added more and more goals to add enjoyment and a sense of satisfaction to my days. it’s easier to do things for someone else than yourself sometimes and i rlly want my bird to grow! plus instead of mindlessly scrolling i’ve been doing more gratitude reflection in the app. i love the prompts and the way it collects data about your mood and Why you feel certain ways is incredible. easiest mood tracker i’ve ever used which is useful bc im bipolar. i’m in love with this app and it’s helped me feel way better in just a couple weeks!Omg this app is so cute, but it cares for you to. Like this app has goals, one being, “literally survive the day”. My goals are, get out of bed, make bed, change clothes, drink water, step outside once, listen to a song that makes me feel good, and take a shower. The fact that this game gives you confidence to- Its so so cute. I love it. My friends joined it, and every time I log on, there is always a message from my friends saying that I’m beautiful, that my friends are thinking of me, or just giving me a heartfelt hug (like if I’m sad it’ll help) and before people go saying, “omg plus makes the app bad” DO NOT. Sure plus might be annoying, but there is literally only a few things you can’t do. Btw, if I could by plus, I would. I would buy it for sure to help you guys. I’m sorry i can’t. Anyway, please get this app if you are feeling sad, not confident in yourself, or anything else. And get it to help you if it’s hard for you to do things, cause goals will definitely help. P.S. I love you finch, you brighten up my day. Thank you, sincerely, Reagan.I’ve tried mood trackers, journal prompts, guided meditation, affirmations, and just about everything else. I downloaded this app on a whim and wasn’t too invested, I was pretty confident that I’d drop it just like everything else. But! I didn’t! There’s something about feeding a tiny baby bird with my words that really works for me. I’m not writing for me, I’m writing for Skittles! I absolutely love this app and would be devastated if I couldn’t use it anymore. I love the smart tags they use from your prompts and the insights, too. I’ve recommended it to so many people!! I love Finch. 

Update! I’ve been using Finch off and on for a year, and I’m certainly more stable when I’m using it. The improvements made during the last year are absolutely amazing! My only request would be the ability to reorder my goals - they’re out of order from how I do them everyday and it makes it a bit difficult to do them all. Sometimes I miss one 😔 (it’s very unfortunate for everyone when the thing I miss is “put on deodorant” 😂) and my whole day is off.This app will not replace a therapist (nor is it advertised as such), but it has already made quite a nice difference in my life. It provides a cute, simple, and fundamentally satisfying “gameplay loop” that has you raising a little bird friend by performing actions such as setting/achieving goals and writing reflections. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed doing these tasks, particularly since I’ve never really stuck with to-do lists or regular journaling before. But Finch makes it feel rewarding and fun, and as a consequence I am feeling much more content, grateful, and productive than I have in some time!

The free version of this app is refreshingly feature-rich and has no ads whatsoever. It’s definitely not necessary to upgrade to the paid version, and it isn’t pushed on you too hard. I am thinking about upgrading just because I want to support the developers, though. For all the harm smartphones and social media, etc seem to be doing to us, Finch feels like a genuinely beneficial use of the technology.  If you’ve read this far, give it a shot!Instagram knows I’m depressed so it’s always offering me mental health apps. Finch works on a principle I know to be true for myself and a lot of people - it’s easier to care for and have compassion for someone else than yourself. It’s the mental health app I use most consistently and have the most pleasure using. It has a very simple interface but collects really surprising and insightful data! It also has very wholesome little adventures with your pet friend, like a really loving RPG. It has a variety of psychologically useful exercises but I only use a couple, and the app is really good about rewarding you for baby steps. If you’ve ever been so depressed you can’t get out of bed, then you know the importance of goals like “stand up for 10 seconds” or “look in the mirror and say ‘I can do it.’” So yeah I think it’s a great app. I’ve had depression since I was 12 and I’m soooooo sick of toxic positivity culture and the basic mental hygiene advice that people are now just discovering because of covid. I’m the Goku of depression, okay. Sadness is my gym. And I like Finch. There.The app Finch is such a great app and I’ll tell you why! First of all Finch can help you stay in contact with friends by sending them small reminders that your there for them! Finch also will have you set goals that you want to keep going daily to help lead to a better life! You can bond with your amazing Finch (shoutout to pancakes 🥞!) and grow with them while designing your Finch, your Finch's outfit, your Finch's clothes, and so much more! One of the things I love most about Finch is that it will help you feel better and form good habits. Finch also is very fair with what you can have with or without the plus/premium option. You can have Finch for free and still occasionally get the plus/premium for FREE for about either 3 days or up to a month! Even without the plus/premium option though, there are so many things you are still able to do! I would recommend Finch to anyone who loves a adventure, making new friends, needs some new goals/habits, and is in need of a healthy community to grow on.

-Ellie & Pancakes 🥞Personally I think this app is super helpful In the way that it makes me check in with my feelings but also makes me want to age up Cloe and make it possible for her to have likes and dislikes. 
   However I’ve grown into the habit of just typing in random words to get more energy and more rainbow gems. And while that’s partially my fault I would love it if you guys could make a reflection about how well you completed your goals. I don’t know about everyone else but I do feel like reflecting about things—especially if I did poorly to do that thing—really makes me improve on the things I reflected on. 
   Also, I would Love a update where you can have a baby/roommate that you can also age up and make room for in your treehouse because that just sounds fun to me. If it doesn’t sound like a good idea to you that’s fine as well I just think that maybe it could be a possibility. Thank you for reading if you did and that’s all I had to say. I hope you have a good day! ❤️This app is honestly amazing! Ive been going through a hard time for the past week with my bff and my mom downloaded this app for herself and showed me and i became interested in it and you can pick the pronouns (which is great that this is being recognized!) of they/them she/her or he/him! And then you can pick the name by picking yourself or you can randomize. Then you can set great goals for yourself including drink water, survive the day, get out of bed, change clothes, look in the mirror and say “i can do it” and so much more! You can even set your own goals and there is breathing exercises for both panic and anxiety attacks which is a great thing for me and anyone else who struggles with and anxiety disorder. There are quizzes on body positivity and more! You can dress up your finch and invite someone to your little town and send them positivity! There is so much more to this app that i cannot name but this has really helped me through anxiety and my problems with friends and everything, thank you so much to the creator who made this! Xoxo 💗💞This app is the best thing i’ve ever downloaded! I downloaded this app to just have a virtual pet and friend. I struggle on staying on task because I get distracted but this app helps me remember everything I need to do. Simple things from making your bed to messaging your friends to listening to a soundscape. This app has goals to get and Finch makes it fun. My characters name is Pip and she is so cute. She is all dressed up for christmas. I like all of the cute items to dress up your pet and how it makes sure to add the gay and so on items. I love all the sweet decor for your pets house and how you do not have to get the membership to continue using the app. Some apps i have owned are very limited on what they give to their users but Finch still gives the users who can’t or don’t want to have the membership a chance still. I do wish that Finch adds the app on Apple Watch. It could be so cute and be easier than opening the app on your phone. Please take this into suggestion. Finch is a wonderful app for young or old. 

   -Addison, 13This has helped me so much in a short amount of time its crazy. When i first got this i didn’t believe it would work so well. I thought “it’s probably just another fake app that wont help me with anything.” But after using it for close to a week i can see a lot of chance in myself. Ive been more willing to clean, put down my phone before bed, drink water, exercise, and a bunch more. The encouragement after you complete one of your goals is amazing, it makes me want to complete another one. I only have the free version so i am a little limited with my goal choices (like the extra goal choices they give you which is just fine bc its just that, an extra. It wont affect my day to much if i dont do it) but even so i still get a good option with the free version. You can hatchit , give it a gender, dress it up, and grow your own baby owl. Plus you can add friends to your owls tree, im making my whole family download it so i can do this with them. If you don’t already have this app pls get it!!With its cute theme, I was able to work my way out of a deep depression. When I log in, there are comforting mantras and quotes, along with my cute bird, who tells me funny and interesting things daily. I worked at my own pace, and at first set easy goals like ‘survive the day’ and ‘remember to breathe’. Slowly I began looking forward to checking things off. It incentivized doing chores and self care. Recently I was given an egg and I tied it to brushing my teeth, and now I look forward to brushing my teeth so that I can hatch this egg! I like that i Can see what days I do and don’t do repeating goals, like my daily shower goal. I like that i Can journal, and do activities like breathing exercises and meditation. I enjoy that it ties together emotions and activities and Can show me what my trends are (such as on hard days I don’t normally shower, on good days I tend to read more). This app has helped me so much. The themes and cute rewards make me want to take care of myself, and give me something to look forward to every day.I downloaded Finch to try to take care of myself because I’ve been struggling with self care my whole life. Finch is the best way to do that! They provide different journeys for you to take (I chose better self) and they create goals that help you in your journey! You can even create your own goals specifically to what you want/need! There was a time not too long ago that Finch was offering a month free of their Finch Plus to whoever wrote a thank you to their sponsor. I don’t make a lot of money, so I decided to enter. Thankfully, they chose me to be sponsored for a month! I was so happy! I love using Finch Plus! Today, my sponsorship ended and they asked if I would like to pay for Finch Plus, but again I don’t make a lot of money, so I selected the option “I can’t afford it” and they gave me Finch Plus FOR FREE!!! I am so grateful for the Finch Team with providing me with the help I need to better myself! Whenever I do end up making more money, I will definitely become a sponsor so that I can do what my sponsor did for me!Finch is a great app that both helps your complete goals and makes you feel good about them. I love the idea that completing your goals help your little friend to grow. Mine is Ivy, and she’s a little cutie. I love that even if you miss a day or two, or a few, that the app doesn’t make you feel guilty. They simply say they missed you and are happy to have you back and you pick up where you left off. It’s completely free besides an expansion to get extra goals but it’s not necessary and doesn’t hinder your experience. The devs are simply the best. I’ve tried many self care apps and games but this is the one i’ve never deleted and actually work with. I’ve down something I never do, and suggested this app to multiple other people. This got away from me, but this app is amazing and I needed to leave a review

Can’t wait to any future updates. I also love the seasonal challenges, seeing as seasonal depression is real and it allows you to try and push yourself for the rewards at the end of the month!I’ve never really found a mental health app before this that I thought was genuinely helpful and felt motivated to keep up with. I have used this app literally every day since I downloaded it and I love it! I struggle a lot with prioritizing goals and organizing my personal schedule. This is a nice, low pressure way to keep up with goals, see which ones are being skipped and which are being accomplished, and to just have another form of reminder of what I’m supposed to be doing. I use the focus timer a lot because I tend to struggle with time blindness and it’s been a huge game changer to watch the time count down while going about my routines. I can see where I’m getting stuck or what’s taking too long, and it keeps me moving at a good pace. I like all of the other features as well honestly and I don’t really have a single negative thing to say! I love this app. It’s super cute, easy to navigate once you get the hang of it, and just a massive toolbox of resources and exercises. I use the free version too!!I have ADHD and social anxiety and I have been using Finch for a few weeks to help with them. I’ve found so much comfort in this app. It’s not boring to look at, which is a major problem for me and other self-help apps. I also have large broken up into smaller little goals that are much easier to achieve. And, I can read my daily reflections in the form of bullet points instead of everything being in one long essay. On top of everything else, I get to take care of an adorable little bird whenever I take care of myself.
Now, I’m not so good with features unless they’re straight-up handed to me. I also have a lot of goals throughout the day and I want to be able to list them chronologically. For instance, my morning goals be at the top, and my nightly ones at the very end. I’m not sure if I’m able to do that already, which is possible and I just haven’t figured it out yet, but if not, I think it’d be beneficial to people such as myself. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. =)Since highschool my journal entries have been the same. Build new healthy habits and rid of unhealthy ones. I’ve tried everything it feels like but I was never able to get the hang of remembering my goals and centering discipline around them. I would forget I was working on them and fall back into my same habit patterns. Now, ever since finding finch, I have been more on top of these healthy habits. I haven’t seen this much progress since I had parents around to help remind me of things. This little bird gives me the drive and desire to want to keep going and building my new life. The addictive nature of a cute digital animal care taking app mixed with reminders, the ability to customize her little world is so desirable to want to keep coming back and checking it. It’s absolutely genius and I’m so glad someone thought of combining today’s world of addicting apps with the desire to build personal habits. I commend you all and I thank you for changing my life.This app is one in a long line of many I’ve tried as part of my journaling for therapy journey, and it’s the first one where I’m finding real success! If you struggle to face your feelings and practice mindfulness, this app might be for you. I find that the desire to care for and interact with the cute little bird friend can be enough to motivate me to actually open the journaling app, when with other apps my avoidance of the stress of my own feelings leaves me ignoring the journaling prompts. 

I love that there’s the option to free write, but also to do little prompts that encourage you to express specific goals or feelings. I also like that they have breathing and stretching exercises. Every morning I feel a little bit excited to open the app and see what my bird found on his overnight journey, and I’m excited to complete goals to earn stones to buy him clothes.

It felt a little silly at first that THIS is what motivates me, but if it works it works! Thank you so much to the dev team :)i’m only on day 2 of having this app, but it has brought me so many happy things. my little finch’s name is Valentina, and i feel a strong sense of responsibility to take care of her which i honestly cannot explain and i’ve gotta give the creators a round of applause for that. the goals i set for myself are relatively easy, since these days i’ve found it hard to be motivated to do things. it will remind you to do those goals in a subtle way, and once you complete them it offers you the chance to reflect on them. it records what you reflect so you can go back and look at the things you previously said. i love sending my little finch on adventures and buying new clothes for her, and the app sends little notifications to you as well. i got one yesterday that only said “Thinking about you~” and it honestly made me so happy even if it’s just from an app. they really have a way to bring your spirits up and not make you feel bad about how your mental health has been. i love this app!I was skeptical of this app helping at all. It’s just a little bird and the tasks are so minimal energy wise. 
But now those are my favorite parts of the app! I like checking in on my little bird. Helping him grow, learn, and explore helps me stay engaged. And those minimal energy tasks are wonderful because I have the bad habit of thinking I can and should be doing all the big things. They help me refocus on the small things and to slow down. They also serve as reminders that sometimes just literally surviving the day is a big feat. Literally survive the day is my favorite goal to add. I try to make my goals the day before but can never know for sure how many spoons I’m going to wake up with. Making sure I have a mix of easy wins and some productive goals has been the sweet spot for me. 
Thank you for this app. And for being so helpful and supportive with answering emails/posts on the FB group. I’m excited to see the app continue to grow, but I hope it stays more or less the same! 💜I’ve been looking for a free self-care app that actually works for me for ages now! This app doesn’t even use ads. There is a premium option, which must be paid for, but it can also be offered at a discounted price for those struggling financially. This app is the only ones I’ve found that not only motivates me to check in, but also motivates me to reach my set goals and improve and challenge myself. This app has been so helpful over the past month I’ve been using it. I really enjoy the look back feature where you can get a summary of your moods, motivations, and satisfaction rates as well as what lifts you up the most, what brings you don’t the most, as well as what area you thrive or struggle in. This is all using the completely free, no-ad version of this app. It is genuinely helpful, and genuinely here to help. Members of the Finch team regularly visit and walk with your pet as well. I love getting to dress my pet up and sending them on adventures everyday.This app is amazing! The makers thought of everything, it’s perfect if you have anxiety/depression, or when you don’t have yourself together. First of all, it’s so cute, you get to name your pet and pick their pronouns, and set goals for everyday, and you earn gems when you complete each goal! Second of all, they include quizzes if you think you have depression or anxiety! And if you do, there are breathing exercises for it. And third of all, you’re able to do simple stretches for when you need to wind down, or when you wake up, and need to be fully awake! Also, there’s this thing called “Tree Town”, where you invite friends, and convince them to download this app, so they can make better decisions, and make a cute best friend (a birdie). Also, you guys, and your pet birds can hang out in the app. You also see your pets personality, their emotion, and see their likes and dislikes as you grow further and further into levels in self-care! If you haven’t downloaded this app yet, please do so now!I’ve had this app for less than a week and it’s crazy how well it works for me. I think some of the negative reviews are just people who misunderstand the purpose of the app, or are not the target audience, because the app does an amazing job at what it’s intended for. 

I only have one complaint: I feel like there needs to be more to do in a day than just the adventure. At first, it seems like the adventure is an all day process, but if you complete a handful of goals, it finishes up super fast. I wake up early, do a bunch of stuff, and by 10am my bird is back. It’s a bummer because then my bird just sits around all day and the incentives/rewards for completing remaining tasks are much lower. I’d love if there was more content available in a day for those of us who use this app for a lot of different things, or if there were at least slightly better rewards for completing goals beyond what it takes to energize the bird and get back from the adventure!To the soon-to-be pet parent, 
The app has allowed me to not only build and keep track of good habits, but also break bad ones. I log my good days and my bad, I write about things I’m grateful for, I do different intervals of yoga, breathing exercises, different soundscapes, and so much more just to gain energy and rainbow stones to tend to my adorable Finch Maple. You can buy clothes, decorate their houses, give them tiaras and the adorable sunglasses, etc. and so much more! I have never been so encouraged to keep up with my goals and continue to make progress. This amazing app also helped me manage my ADHD by allowing me to create specific “journeys” and customizable goals with an extra cute incentive to get me focused. Your finch goes on adventures & comes back with stories that you can respond to that helps form their personality. I absolutely love this app, and I’m so grateful that I found it because it changed my life. Thank you to the incredible Finch team for creating this beautiful app.I’m not one to lie on reviews, so believe me when I say that I rely on this app. I have ADHD and the goals feature lets me easily put in any tasks I have to get done so I can remember them and at the same time be rewarded for them! It makes all of the things I don’t want to do into a game and helps me actually want to do them. 

It’s a safe space to rant and ramble about anything and everything, and there’s a lot of cool ways to look back on your progress or how certain people impact you. It has let me see who in my life stresses me out or how just drinking water and eating food lifts my mood. I also have two friends who use this app and we use tree town as a cute way to check in with each other. 

All in all I have never once had a complaint with this app. Every update it gets better! Forty bucks for the Plus version might have been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Thank you to the Finch team! What you do is wonderful and I hope you all have a wonderful day!I have tried several of these kinds of apps, targeted at changing your daily routine, and bettering your mental health, but it’s hard to stick to the routines I set.
What’s different about this app is that I feel rewarded for completing my daily goals / routine, and it pushes me to complete them again the next day to get rewarded again! Using a rewards system as a form of positive reinforcement is so much more helpful for me than simply having a list of things as a routine that I need to complete with no “push” to do those things.
Not only that, but I have not found an app yet that has as many resources under the free option as this app. Having several options for first aid, to help my anxiety attacks and panic attacks, to help ground me, is immensely appreciated. Being able to take quizzes to check up on my mental health is a nice bonus.
There are so many fun and helpful components of this app - I highly recommend you download it immediately, and check it out!This app takes exactly as much effort as you’d like it to- which is fantastic for me, as I find that my energy levels fluctuate a lot, which is the whole reason I got this.
Living at school with ADHD has been really hard for me. Things from making sure I do laundry in a timely manner, or showering often, or drinking water; these things I can’t put on the calendar, or put on an alarm, because if I don’t have the time or energy to do it at the time I put it for, it simply isn’t getting done.

This app is adorable. The art style is playful and casual enough to be more attractive to me than a to-do list, and there’s so many little features that help me so much nowadays. I can set tasks to repeat on certain days, be completable several times in a day (such as drinking water) or carry over to the following day until it’s done (such as showering or doing laundry). I have little goals for every day like “take medication”, “put on clean clothes”, and things like “text my family that I love them” once a week. These are little things to me, but sometimes I can’t bring myself to get out of bed. Sometimes I forget my medication one day, which snowballs into several days. Sometimes I lose sense of time, and it’s suddenly been a month since I texted my parents.

It’s all little things, but god, do they pile up. And completing them, whenever I can, feels like an achievement now, and a weight off.

Thank you, Finch team!I enjoy the daily goals a LOT. It’s the only app I’ve found that doesn’t penalize you in any way for missing a day, missing a goal, skipping a goal for any reason. There’s no obvious negative reaction if a streak is broken (that I’ve seen) so I don’t feel guilty for not being able to do it. HOWEVER getting to check them off and getting TIME SPECIFIC REMINDERS !!! To complete them is very rewarding and makes you want to do it to make your little bird happy.

I like the “how are you feeling?” Check in when you open the app. It’s nice to have that moment of reflection, even just for a second. I feel I can be honest to the birb as they won’t judge me for any answer I give. There’s zero negative reaction.

Getting to visit friends is so fun! It and the adventures are a nice way to feel like you’re taking care of it, without the stress of an actual health system. I like getting to remind my friends that I’m thinking about them, and getting to see eachothers birds together is precious. Especially with long distance friends!

I also enjoy the questions! They give me something to ponder and I often learn something new about how I feel on a subject! And I like that you get good things regardless of the answer. There’s zero right or wrong and it’s lovely!

All around I am VERY pleased with the app! Will continue to use it and will definitely reccomend it to people! If it becomes possible in my budget any time soon I will consider upgrading for sure!First off this is a amazing app. It is a fun and cute way of getting motivated and make your self better. If your wondering if you should get this you 100% should. Basically how it works is you get a egg that hatches in to a bird. You name the bird and the. set goals and set stuff that you have to do. It’s motivational because it will reward you with rainbow stones if you complete tasks. With the rainbow stones you can purchase clothes and furniture for your little bird. The bird goes on adventures and learns something new every time and your bird will tell you what happened and what they learned. Your little bird levels up. You can add friends that have the app to show you support them and you’ll get 600 rainbow stones. There is SOOOOOO much more in this app but you have to get it to find out. :) This is very motivational and helps you be the best self that you can. So that leads me to tell you YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET THIS APP! I wish every one had this app it would make the world so much better.When I downloaded this app while browsing through the App Store, I honestly thought I would immediately delete it like I do with every other self-care app. However, I’ve logged in every single day since I’ve downloaded this two weeks ago, and it really helps with motivation. I realized that although I love games that have streaks, it de-motivates me when I lose a streak after not logging in one day. With Finch, there aren’t any notable streaks to worry about, and it feels freeing. It makes me think “It’s okay if I forgot to wash my face this morning. Just do it tomorrow.”

Yesterday, I had a really bad anxiety attack in the morning and when I opened the Finch app and logged my mood, I noticed that the goals were moved down and I was provided with gentle reflection prompts. I’m not sure if that was programmed intentionally, but it really did make me feel better. 

The only con I have with this app is how slowly you collect rainbow stones. I would love to see some mini games in the future!At first this just helped me recognize the little things I was doing everyday that I wasn’t giving myself credit for. It also helped me remember to complete tasks that improved the way I felt, though I would sometimes skip them without reminders from finch (examples: stretching, drinking extra water, making my bed.) Initially I didn’t care much about the character (birb) or the game aspect of the app but over time I started to enjoy it and it actually motivates me to check the app, and complete my goals as well as add new goals. A friend recommended finch so we interact on the app daily as well which is a nice feature and helps me feel more connected to my friend. Anyway, I use the free version though I did appreciate finch plus, I can’t justify paying for it given my current financial situation, and I think it works well either way. If you’re looking for help accomplishing realistic goals/tasks, this could be a very helpful tool.Wow. This app is so amazing, even without the subscription. I struggle with my mental health so this app has been a WONDER. (I’m not just saying this either) If you have mental health problems, I highly recommend this app. I would give it 50/5 stars if I could.

Update: I still agree with the rating of 50/5, and also I saw another rating that said that even if you don’t feel motivated to finish goals, that it’s okay. I will admit that I haven’t finished some goals before, but finch NEVER like, puts me down for it. It’s just “What made you decide to skip ‘(insert goal here)’?” instead of “Why did you skip??? What is wrong with you??” Which I think is super encouraging. There are also no ads, which, with a lot of apps these days, you can’t escape the ads. My finch’s name is Finn, and I love them so much! I love that during pride month there’s also pride merch and I just love how (overall) inclusive Finch is. Thank you so much, creators of Finch. Keep up the good work!Ever since discovering Finch, it has become a daily part of my life. I love being able to set goals, do breathing exercises, and reflect about my day. I work as a medical records technician for a nonprofit substance disorder and mental health clinic and the rant zone has become a huge lifesaver, as I used to being my home stress to work and vice versa. Watching Winter grow and learn new things has really incentivized me, especially as I grew up playing Neopets and Webkinz. I have recommended it to all my coworkers because of how much I love this app! The price for the yearly subscription is affordable and completely worth it.

The one suggestion I have is to have goals you can set and complete daily without having to enter them every night before bed. I take medications for my mental health and chronic illnesses and there are days I am rushing out the door that I forget to grab them. It would be extremely helpful to be able to set that constant morning reminder.I remember the day I got this app. I had been severely depressed. I went through stages of giving up, hurting myself, starving myself, crying all night, etc. It was horrible. I literally woke up one day and one of my first thoughts were ‘I want to feel better.’ I did some digging, and found this app.
Unlike other apps, this one has goals, reflections, quizzes, breathing exercises, mediation, workouts, and first aid which is meant for anxiety and depression. I have never seen so much in an app.
You get your own bird that you get to grow up with. They will go around a forest and learn new things. It’s amazing.
This app has helped my depression so much. I’m currently recovering from an eating disorder, cured my depression, and feel 10x more confidence. If I could sponsor this app, I would.
I have one problem. I loved the excitement of my bird growing up. My bird is an adult now and I wish I could grow other birds with her too. Maybe like a little sister/brother bird. Just a suggestion.Hi, I’ve been using Finch for about 8 months. As someone who likes to stay organized, this is perfect. I love how Finch turns checking off daily, weekly, or long-term goals into a game. I also love how you can customize your goals by adding a time, how many times you do this a day, etc. It’s incredibly satisfying to see all my goals and tasks organized into “journeys”, and how my progress is reflected through my self care best friend, aka my Finch. Personally, I think this is one of the best apps out there. 
	My suggestion is that for a goal you want to do multiple days a week, like Friday and Saturday for example, you can set a different time for each day, so that the task you want isn’t on the same time each day. For example, the time of the task could be 7:00PM on Friday, but 2:00PM on Saturday. I hope that this will be added in the next update. I appreciate all the developers for their hard work on this app! 🐣❤️So a few weeks ago I was complaining to my therapist about how I always have trouble sticking with self care apps after the initial week I download them and she recommended Finch to me. Not only is it completely adorable (my penguin Penelope is the cutest thing ever) but it actually provides tools other than writing ‘diary style’ like quizzes for mental health and breathing exercises, etc. It’s really nice to have different outlets to express myself and to track my moods and goals and daily thoughts other than writing my life out everyday and I really appreciate that. Plus the quizzes are SUPER helpful at tracking depression and anxiety and looking at trends (if that applies to you.) Another bonus I look forward to is the customization portion because who doesn’t want to dress a penguin in a Hawaiian shirt and some sandals?!?!? Overall I’m in love with this app and I look forward to tracking my progress over time and seeing what new updates bring!I have depressed/anxiety and always had difficulty with my motivation and following goals I make for myself. Intrinsic motivation and rewards are exceptionally hard for me, and I was trying to figure out something to help with that. Then I downloaded Finch and I follow it almost everyday. It's only been a couple of weeks that o started, but I've looked at it and made goals about 5/7 days a week which is amazing for me. Also having the ability to easily make goals - helps me reflect on the fact that I'm putting too much on myself sometimes, and it suggest goals that seem simple but says phrases like ""sometimes you just need it"" - which is so great. Not to mention the check in with mood. That is wonderful, and I can see any mood changes or patterns that I wouldn't check without being prompted to do so. It really helps and I would recommend it for anyone who has difficulty with motivation and mood!!As a mom of 3 currently struggling with PPD, practicing mindfulness and self-care is necessary but overwhelming. I never felt that I had any time to take care of myself and my personal needs. This app makes self-care more digestible. I can spend just a couple minutes at a time on it a few times a day and it helps me so much. I can keep in touch with my emotional state, set self-care goals, and record my thoughts and feeling in short little spurts throughout the day — while I’m in the bathroom, picking up grocery order, or nursing.

I’m not into cutesie things. Its not the little pet that draws me to this app. But it does disguise the self-care aspect of the app and make it a little more entertaining and less of a chore.

The free version is awesome and totally worth using. I’m sure the premium version is great too, I just don’t really have the money to use it at this time. But I appreciate how the free version is a helpful resource in and of itself. 💕 I can tell the developers care.

The tagging feature is awesome! I love how the app tracks my moods and makes it easy to make associations between my emotional state and certain activities/people.

Overall, I would totally recommend this app. I showed it to my therapist and she thinks it’s awesome too! It’s no substitute for professional mental health services, if needed, but it is a perfect supplemental tool that would be great for anyone to use. Don’t hesitate to download it!I love this game! I just got it last week and it has helped me a lot. If your thinking it will make you have more screen time, then think again because some of the goals are about shortening screen time. I love how inclusive this game is too! It has lgbtq+ accessories and it has they/them pronouns along with it. This game is like no other because it has absolutely, positively, NO ADS!!! There is only one in app purchase which is plus and it lets you get more goals and more quizzes and it’s pretty cheap. I have been checking in with my finch every single day and I love them! The only thing bad that’s happened to me in this game is that today my bird (Sami) turned into a toddler and I got the pop up for the color shop. I picked the color blue to match Sami’s outfit but then, the same pop up came so fast that it made Sami pink! That is the only problem I’ve had so far but thank you for this amazing game and please keep up the good work!!! :)I have been using the free version of this app for a couple of weeks now and I LOVE IT. I look forward to it every day! I love opening it first thing when I wake up because I get to see my little finch waiting to greet me. I know it sounds strange, but there’s just something more motivating about knowing that a virtual pet is waiting for you to complete your goals in order for it to feel taken care of and loved. If you’re super empathetic and love animals it makes it that much better. I haven’t gone a single day I think where I forgot to open the app and complete some or all of my goals set, and do the reflection exercises. There’s so many features, they even have a good amount of quizzes to take on various mental health issues (not a diagnosis but helpful to get some insight about what might be going on with your mental wellness)

Great job to the developers on creating this fun, interactive, and very useful + beneficial app!!!I love this app SO MUCH and it even gives you little positive things like “you were happy when talking about Lia” and it’s so cute because lately I’ve been really excited to see my cousin and this app just says “you expressed being ‘SUPER HAPPY’ when talking about ‘Lia’” and I just think it’s the sweetest little thing 🥰 

It also lets you give yourself goals and things like “drink water” or “workout” and things like that. 

There’s a little bird as well that you can get clothes for (you earn these little rainbow stones that you buy him/her/it clothes with) your little bird and I just got these little Bonny slippers :)))) (mines a girl) she also gives you little reminders on your phone saying that she looks up to you and she loves you and things and it actually weirdly enough helps a ton. You should really get this all if struggling with mental health. It’s helped me a lot! ILY guys! Stay safe, don’t hurt yourself, and lookout for yourself and others!!!!! 😘I love this app! I have tried many mental health apps and meditation apps in the past, but this one takes the cake. It has everything you want in one app, movement videos, breathing exercises, meditation timer, goal setter, daily tracker, journal, mood tracker, and an adorable virtual bird. Some specific features I appreciate compared to other apps:
- You can pause breathing exercises for people like me who have a hard time doing them
- The finch is so adorable and so genuinely want little Macha to succeed and grow, so I make sure to complete my tasks
- This app has improved my depression 
- The in game currency is rainbow stones, which is more joyful than coins
- They are very inclusive to different disabilities and queer identities
- When Macha is out adventuring it makes me feel like I want to be learning something too
- The in game community is called tree village or something similar and you can add people even if they don’t have the app and write reflections about them
- If I want more coins I never just impulsively mark all of my goals as done because 1) the game gives you a lot of free rainbow stones and 2) i can just do some reflections and improve my mental health without having to lie to the app! 

It’s basically headspace, gamify, zen, and mood tracker all in one. I would reccomend this app for anyone, but especially people with mental health struggles and/or chronic illness/physical disabilities.Over the years I’ve tried, and faithfully used, many self care apps, goal trackers, and diary apps. Some have been great, others not so much but I never really found an app that gamified taking care of myself while also setting goals to make myself a better person. And then I found Finch. Finch encourages you to be better but also has grace for the moments when you fall short. There’s a really nice social aspect to it that lets you encourage others while maintaining your privacy too. And to top it all off it’s centered on an adorable bird that you grow and teach and dress up as you go through your journey. I honestly haven’t found a single thing I don’t like. I’m just sad I’m in a spot right now where I can’t pay for premium simply because I want to support the developers. The app is great even in the free version, and I hope the devs can keep it up and let the app stay this awesome and free for folks like me!This is the best app I have ever come across! I saw an add for it and thought it was cool. I had been looking for self care/mental health apps for a while but all of them were boring. I expected this one to be boring to but I downloaded and I was so surprised! I created my bird and her name is Pepper. I started creating daily goals and starting journeys, and after a few minutes, I already loved Pepper. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to ever delete her. I started using the app every morning and night to help me with my routines and good habits. It’s a great app because the emotional attachment keeps you from quitting, but you don’t feel guilty about not completing all your goals as long as you sent your finch on an adventure! This was exactly what I needed. I have been using this for a month now and I have already created great habits from this app. Definitely get the app! You will not regret it!!“Basil” my finch, is 33 days old today. She/the app has helped me to set goals and think about why they’re meaningful. Let me first say that I’m not a goal writer or a list maker. I don’t even make a list when I go to the grocery store. Finch has helped to give myself credit for small things….. Like, literally, getting out of bed and taking a shower. If I don’t get out of bed or I don’t take a shower, there’s no judgment. Finch/Basil doesn’t alert you to failures or missed deadlines. It allows you to move at your own pace without feeling bad. On a analytical note: Finch tracks your moods, behaviors, and creates hashtags to better understand yourself. As a new user, I appreciate being able to see trends and abnormalities that I may not have been aware of about myself. Thank you Finch for making it easy to guide myself through self-help. I also want to say thank you for making the character so cute and responsive to the user’s needs. 🥰💙🐦I love this app so much. Ive decided to disconnect this summer and be a better self and this helps with that. So many other apps have annoying pay walls and you cant do anything. This one has a premium subscription but there is so much you can do without having it. You can basically make a yourself a schedule for the day, with whatever you need help with. Hygiene, mental health, bettering yourself, and you can customize the goals, when you want reminders (which arent annoying), how many times a day, and more. I also never liked reflections but these prompts are so good and are making me more intune with my emotions. Ive never wrote so much about my feelings ever but ive written over 900 words in a day. Its actually amazing and a support. Its also a good thing to distract yourself with by doing exercises (physical and mental), doing reflections, soundscapes, quizzes, etc instead of social media. Its really a great app!!I’ve always struggled with tasks, and have paid for a ton of task apps to help me organize my life, and they will work for a while and then I lose interest. But there is something about taking care of a little cute bird that is so much more motivating. Sometimes you’ll do things for others that you won’t do for yourself - I get to take better care of myself by taking care of the finch. Everything is just so cute and positive.

My favorite part is the journaling - you get to reflect on the actions you take or the moods you and it makes you more aware of how the small decisions are impacting your life. You can also journal about the large decisions too.

The journaling is also my least favorite part because I love to journal, and that can be a “hack” to give my finch all the energy it needs. I can just journal and avoid the other goals. But on a bad day, I guess it’s good to have because your finch can still adventure if you’re not motivated.

I also love the soundscapes and breathing exercises. If you’re extremely stressed and have bad habits (smoking, etc) and you think, “ugh what do I do?” You can just open your finch and have a ton of healthy exercises 1 min, 3min, 10min, 1 hour to help you.

I love it. I do subscribe, and I think the price is more than fair and more than worth it. I can’t wait for this to continue to evolve. This is a much needed service. And it’s cute.This is such a lovely app for all age groups! My teenager uses it, my preteen uses it, and I use it. A fun and interactive app that encourages self care through setting healthy, realistic daily goals. Journaling experiences that foster healthy skill development and reasoning.

I love that there is a ‘first aid’ option available and that breathing exercises are included. I also applaud the app creators in recognizing that adding friends to our tree in this app helps to create a positive support group. 

Having a little finch to care for adds an element of fun to self care. In caring for our birb we can learn to better care for ourselves. I do wish we had the option to ‘gift’ friends in our tree though. I have items for my sweet finch that I won’t put to use, but I know my support group members may like them for their own birds. All in all, I have nothing but positives to say! Fantastic app, definitely recommend!This app has been the most helpful mental health app I have ever used. The characters are cute and I’m glad that it really focuses on the positives when it comes to goals. It really makes the app feel encouraging and lots of the messages that you get from your little bird friend are also encouraging. I also really enjoy the mood check in and the inspiring quotes to get you throughout your day. 

I have used many different apps to keep track of my mental health or to manage when my symptoms are overwhelming. This app has everything in one place. I’ve appreciate that I can access the first aid tab if I am struggling with my anxiety and it has all of the tools that I need to help call myself down. It has a lot of tools that I have learned elsewhere in my life that I can never seem to remember when I am in the midst of a panic attack. I also like that this app lays it all out for you and guide you through it step-by-step.

In addition to these things I also appreciate the movement and exercise sections. That is something I personally struggle with and it feels really good to be able to do something small every day to help myself in that area. Plus the character is so cute there’s so many customization options and it really makes it fun to just check in every day and see what’s new. 

I really do recommend this app to everyone I know.This app is amazing and a fantastic way to work on your mental health. I have been loving this and all the little things the app recommends to help better myself. My one complaint is the neighbor system they use. You can add friends to your community which is amazing but thats as far as it goes. There is no way to see how your friends are doing or to set up community goals which would have been an amazing way to help people to communicate and express there mental health with their friends. Personally i would love for there to be an option or something where i could allow my treehouse group to see what my pet and i did today. This would provide a way to spot if me or my friends were heading into a down without having to pressure anyone into talking about issues they may be struggling to communicate. This is still an amazing app but i hope that there will be updates to the friend system soon.I struggle with anxiety and depression, and I am a student with a lot of stress on my shoulders. This app helps me unpack my days and separate the good from the bad. I can reflect on the best parts of my day and rant about the worst and often I get to see just how good many of my days are. It really has taught me to appreciate the little things. The little pet is adorable and buying him clothes is a great incentive for me to continue working on journaling. Additionally, the goals feature is really helpful for me. Even if the goal is just to drink a cup of water or brush my teeth, it feels good to accomplish it and that goes towards my lil guy’s wardrobe! I use the free version of this app and it’s honestly perfect quality. While the payed version has some more features, the free version is good enough as is. I could not recommend this app enough whether you use it for setting goals, journaling, or just dressing up a cute little pet!I’ve been using it for a few days and I love the vibe of this app, and it’s actually useful for me as a tool to make to do lists (using the goals) and chill out. I love doing nighttime and morning stretches, the soundscapes, and the diary prompts. I also like how it doesn’t shove your own goals down your throat and it’s easy to set it for another day. It’s nonjudgmental and helpful, even having a suggested goal category called “we’ve all been there” which has goals like getting out of bed and changing your clothes. This app is made for people who want/need a little help in their life.

The free version is amazing, and you don’t need to pay for it to be very useful and enjoyable. Plus, it doesn’t shove the payed version down your throat which I very much appreciate. Right now I’m not paying for more, but the payed version is cheap and offers even more of what I already have so I’m gonna move to that soon.I have had trouble with self care for years. This app was my solution. I’ve used it literally every day for weeks and it’s just been so helpful. I’d always recommend this to any friends or anyone looking for accessible self care. Not only is the plus completely optional, you still have a great experience without it. Not to mention, watching your little birb grow as you become more happy and take care of yourself more, you unlock new features that get you excited. I’m a genuine customer. Not an ad, nothin. I have all my friends added on here and I genuinely think it strengthened our relationships. Not only that it’s just cute, personalized, and honestly my favorite app on my phone. Not to mention their socials are really active and they are always answering questions. I genuinely think that this app is one everyone needs. It’s perfect for everyone. Personalized goals and birbs for everyone!!!I seriously love this app! This app is so relaxing for me and I love how everything is easy to find like first aid, journaling or goals. This app was the stability I needed! And I love how you can add your friends or family to your treetown! I really like the fact it’s really cute but it doesn’t really feel like a game nor is it hard to achieve goals, it really feels validating when I’ve accomplished all my goals for the day and get to send my bird off on an adventure! I feel like this app has help me so much without it feeling like I had to do a lot of work cause the last thing you want to do when you’re have these days where your mental health is not great is to do a lot of work or having to put so much energy and effort into doing things. I thank the creators of this app a whole lot cause they are one of the reasons I’ve started to get my life together one day at a time.I have struggled intensely with my mental health for years. Because of this, my children have also been effected- when I found finch I tried it first and right away knew my kids would also benefit. It’s created a pattern of checking finch for all three of us, setting and achieving goals, and connecting to each other in our finch forest. It’s also given my kids the initiative to journal and get connected with their emotions, and see how the pattern of setting goals is so beneficial for mental health. I appreciate it, not only for myself and keeping a focus on my mental health, but also to help my kids (13 and 7) to work in their mental health and realize my health is not because of them, but we can all work together to create a more positive goal oriented focus. Thank you. My only request is you create a family plan- because it’s a lot of money to pay for all three accounts when I’m on a tight budget.OH MY GOSH DO I LOVE THIS APP!!! I’ve never felt so deeply about one but this takes the cake and more cakes lol 🎂!!! It helps the helper to real it in and really help themselves while they think they are helping this, by the way ADORABLEEEE, little finch that YOU name!!!! You get to celebrate things like your half birthday (which was not expected and mind blowing I LOVED IT!!!), adventuring, discovery for yourself and your finch, healing, exercises to relax from your anxiety, regrounding, appreciation of things and people, and SOOOOO MUCH MOREEE!!! When I get done using the app for that check in from doing goals and being productive in my self Love I always have such a big smile on my face and I feel sooooo joyful and better than when I went on especially if I had a hard day!!! I Love this app and have been recommending to everyone lol!!! ✝️💖🥰 God bless healing warriors! Take some time for yourself in your healing and goal making journey!!✝️🥰💖This app is amazing. It makes you feel happy and peaceful. It helps me with my goals and processing my hard days. I have severe ptsd, ocd, depression and anxiety. It doesn’t fix them by any means but it brings me a bit of peace and relief. It also helps me keep on track with some goals! The feeling of getting a Little reward for making achievements helps a lot to motivate me. The journaling aspect has been nice too. I also appreciated that it has hotlines! Plenty of places to call and text. I love dressing up my little guy and designing her room plus getting to learn about her! Another wonderful thing about this app is how it doesn’t have a jillion ads and it’s actually playable. It brings me peace and happiness and makes my days just a bit easier. I hope to see even more from this app! Ps I think the only thing I’d say is a bit more tutorial or have the option to go through a tutorial!I struggle with executive dysfunction because of autism, trauma, depression, and anxiety, and have to be very intentional about how I spend my energy. The thing that I love about this app most is that it takes a lot of the work out of planning my day, and it feels like a game. I’ve actually been wanting a game-like self care app for years but the few of them that I’ve seen are just not appealing to me. 

This is the first time in years that taking care of my home and my body has felt easy for an extended period of time, and I’ve had it for a month and a half. I paid for the year’s subscription and honestly, even if I were to stop using it right now I would feel it was worth it. It’s not mind blowing or particularly complicated. It’s just simple, and that’s what I need. 

The reward system makes it easy to feel like I’ve accomplished something right away every day by doing a few tasks, and each task completed reduces the amount of time your little bird friend spends on their adventure. There’s no shame tied to skipping goals or pushing myself too far, and it encourages setting attainable goals on bad days too, like “get out of bed” or “stand up for ten seconds.”

The customization of your bird’s home and clothing is fun, but not so involved that l lose sight of the point of the app. It feels good to take care of the bird by taking care of myself.I have absolutely LOVED Finch.  It says it is for self care, but I think for me it is better described as a mindfulness tool.  I use it to assess my mood and how I am feeling and why I am feeling the way I am.  It allows me to make goals and reflect on accomplishing or skipping them, I can use it for a break during the work day, or to wind down in the evening.  I love the self awareness I get from using it.  And the finches are very cute - so fun to dress up.  And when your finch comes back from an adventure, it is fun to talk with them about it and usually leads to some introspection or new insights about one thing or another.  It is also very fun to have friends to visit and send good vibes to.  On the whole I would highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to be more mindful, increase their self awareness, and be kinder to themselves.  I know it has helped with my own mental illness and has for others as well.  It is a great app.When I was first creating my bird and the screen to buy finch pro popped up I was sad and thought you had to pay, so finding out there was a free version was great news to me. I love this app (even though I’m only on day 11).  It actually helps me want to do my routine! 😂 
I love how I can make my little friend feel good we’ll simultaneously helping me also. 
The free version doesn’t have to many things different from the pro, but if it’s in your budget I can definitely see how pro would be a great fit for many. Over all the aesthetic of this makes a little thing in my mind just feel so great. I adore how there’s a shop where you can buy stuff to customize your bird with. 
It was super smart of the developers to make it so when you complete goals you fuel your own bird to go on an adventure! The chats after adventures are one of the many  highlight of this app in my opinion.This app really is fantastic! It’s not like the usual self care/self help/blah blah apps where you get a choice of 5 to-dos that if you’re truly struggling,do not seem in the realm of possible. But you can get infinitely more if you drop $200 a year. 
There are many ways to use the app and the “goals” lists,from bare minimum of being reminded to drink water and change clothes to harder like trying something out of your comfort zone to helping a stranger on the subway,it has something that everyone can make use of. You can even add your own. All while taking care of,and learning about your companion birb. Oh,and no funding needed if you can’t spare it or it’s just not your thing. 
The developers really care about what they’re doing,and you can tell. They’re so helpful and considerate,and have built an amazing and safe place in their community for users. Thank you to the team,for that!I want to start with saying kind of as a disclaimer that this app isn’t going to make all of your problems go away. However, it does take me to a better place! Finch helps me to take a few moments for myself each day, and also encourages me and helps me feel motivated. I like that there are different goals to achieve such as saying something you’re thankful for or even washing the towels! It’s super helpful for me to know that even a daily chore can be a form of self help if you will. I enjoy the tree town feature and being able to link with my friends and send each other encouragement. Over all, I think this is a really handy app to help you assess yourself. Goals are attainable and rewards are easy to come by and not hard to work towards. I am enjoying the free version very much but wouldn’t mind paying ~$35 for the plus version if I ever felt compelled.I don’t write reviews on apps at all, and I know some may not believe that, but it’s true. I frankly delete the app if I don’t like it and leave it at that. 
But I have some things to say about this one. 
This app is the best self-care app I have ever downloaded, and yes it’s a virtual “game” in a sense but it has been phenomenal and lots of props to the developers of it. I don’t have to worry about feeling pressure to do the goals, it sends kind reminders and I get to send them to my friends. It has helped me feel so much better about my mental health and has helped me put into practice the positive-self talk and other healthy coping mechanisms that I was struggling to do. And I haven’t even purchased the plus, even though it has more features I frankly don’t have to do it. 
To anyone struggling with mental health, know that you are heard and as someone who also struggles with it this app is worth the download.I haven’t been this motivated in ages! I try to complete all my goals everyday and even bought the subscription (which I never do with apps!) and I’m in love with this app. It’s an instant hook. I would say tho I would like to see in the future a way to talk to the finch pet and not get an automated response. What do I mean with this? There’s a ton of apps/websites using AI chatbots to talk back to you based on context you provide to the language model. Chat GPT is a great example! So when finch arrives after an adventure and asks me questions like “why is the dark scary?” I can provide my own answer like “it’s not scary when you have a night light!” And I would get an answer back from the context I provided like “you’re right! A night light would help a lot!” Instead of the automated response “Roger that”. This of course is just a suggestion to make the app even more awesome ! Keep it up Finch Team!Finch is a phenomenal achievement - an easy, gamified way to check in with yourself, relax, and accomplish your goals. Everything that other apps had me try once, Finch gives me motivation to do again and again: journaling, habit tracking, stretching, breath exercises, writing down daily tasks. I feel much more focused and balanced using Finch, and can’t wait to continue. I just switched over to the paid version, mainly for more options when stretching/exercising, but the free version is excellent. All the emergency self care methods are always available, and the reward points don’t change between free and paid. I like being able to support the free tier for others. The Facebook community is also wonderful, with the developers constantly engaged in finding bugs, explaining how features work, and soliciting feedback.I saw this app it was recommended to me with adds and what not, I thought it was another one of those unhelpful “self care” apps. But no. This app and its five star rating have proved me wrong more times then I can count, this app deserves every star it gets. I have never been more motivated to do stuff like even getting out of bed in my life. 

The app is amazing, it’s not a pay to play kinda app either. You can pay for more options but even without it’s still a great app! You can create goals for yourself and when you compleat them you get energy for your little finch! It’s an adorable way to get threw the day. I also love the fact it has stretching and stuff like yoga, it has sounds for bed and it has breathing routines. It’s really helpful for people like me who have been incredibly stressed out recently! This app has completely saved me and it might save you too!This game is really sweet. I haven’t been feeling very good lately and I saw an ad for this app on TikTok and just decided to download it. I wasn’t expecting much especially when I saw that there was in-app purchases, but after playing it for awhile the in-app purchases didn’t bother me at all. I have never seen an app like this one, you can set goals as well as reflect on your day. There is this one exercise that I was really surprised about, it is the stretching one. Like all the other apps I was expecting it to just tell me to do some streches and then press complete but the app actually guides you. And the streches aren’t hard and can be completed easily. The app also sometimes give out survey for yourself, for example I got one that was how appreciative are you of your body. Overall this app is really fun and I have yet to find something that I didn’t like.My number one goal in using any app ever is to find one that is both functional at the free level of use and ad free. 

This app is both. There are no annoying pop ups constantly trying to trick you into clicking and subscribing (there is a subscription but for once it simply unlocks more of what you ALREADY get instead of putting all the options behind a paywall). 

The content you get in this app is phenomenal.

 Tons of journaling prompts, several meditation and breathing exercises with visuals and timers. To do lists and cute stories from your pet that are just so sweet that you will be full of fuzzy feelings (and the very interesting option of journaling about each pet storyline and meditation exercise to explore how you feel about it). You can earn points to dress up your pet and the rewards come at a reasonable pace so I was never left feeling like I had to spend money to get points or like I got everything on offer too fast and therefore had no goals.

The app is also just encouraging enough to make me want to use it several times a day without being that bad for me level of addicting that makes me waste my life on apps and stress about forgetting to use it. 

Bonus love for the notification messages of love and support from your pet! Im not going to lie, its made me tear up occasionally.So firstly I’d like to say you guys designed an easy to use app that helps someone actively engage with difficult to do tasks when they are mentally ill or easily distracted. So thank you for that! I’d like to give some suggestions though if you could make little notifications that get the dopamine receptors in the brain going the same way social media does I think you could potentially help people hack their brains for a positive purpose. Now I will talk about all the features yall created which I love and appreciate: the find a helpline, the positive quotes, the silly lil birb outfits, the preset easy goals you can pick, the tree town so you can potentially connect with friends who now can mutually motivate you, the decompression exercises, and finally the cute lil art style. Thank you for creating such a great app!I’m 16 trying to work on my own depression and personal issues, just trying to make it through the day. It wasn’t until today when I found this app that I’ve actually felt slightly motivated. To be completely honest, I was hoping that the reviews of other people who have used this app were true and would legitimately meet my expectations on helping me, and they have! I feel like I’m able to make goals without going haywire and feeling like I have to try tacking on a million things at once. What makes it even better is the fact that I’m able to take care of a virtual pet that builds its own interest overtime. An additional thing that makes me happy is the pronouns and LGTBQ+ flags included in the game. This is the first time i’ve ever decided to recommend an app to a friend of mine, or anyone in general. Please download this app you won’t regret it! :)I love this app! I am a Licensed Therapist that uses this personally. I have also shown it to some of my clients and my family. Several of my clients (and family) have begun to utilize this as a way to implement important self-care/self-empowerment/coping tools that, at times, can be difficult to engage in and or access in the moment of distress. This app makes it easy and fun to do. 
It does not make unattainable goals that can lead to belief that we “failed” to meet goals— it sets you up for success by allowing you to accomplish realistic goals and reflect on those we may have not been able to meet (as well as reflect on those we have). 
I also really like the feature that when you click on “First Aid” it has access to find/connect to different helplines if the skills they have listed aren’t as helpful in that moment. 
I highly recommend this!I normally never write reviews but this app is so amazing and even though I’ve only been using it for 5 days it has really changed my life and mindset and if you are thinking about downloading it do it. I love how you can add friends and this app  has so many different options for every person, no matter what their goal is. I struggle with not being too hard on myself and setting too high of goals for myself and this app has really helped me with staying positive. I find absolutely nothing wrong with this app but if u do download it I would recommend not turning on the notifications because with every goal u set, it notifies you to do it which is helpful, yes, but in my opinion it got a bit annoying lol. But other than that it is a great app and I think everyone should give it a try because it’s super helpful and cute:)I’ve struggled with many bouts of mental health issues. The one thing I always looked for was an outlet for my feelings, that wasn’t a journal, a person, etc. Finch is perfect. My little buddy makes me feel like I can get all the things off my chest and never feel bothersome, never feel like an inconvenience to someone. Not to mention, completing goals and actually following through with things is rewarding because of the rainbow stones I can use to make my little guy even cuter. It is the highlight of my day to interact with my finchie. Since I have got this app I can see improvements in my mental health. I did initially use free and upgraded and honestly, it’s worth it. I chose the yearly option. I love love love this app and truly can’t imagine life without it now. Please keep up the great work admins, I’m loving all the new accessories and everything coming. 10/10Normally I don’t write reviews, but honestly I love this app too much to not write a review. For the past six-ish years I’ve had an up-and-down fight with depression and finding my motivation. Regardless of what I did I found it hard to stick to goals or create new and good habits. Then I got an ad for finch, and since I’m a sucker for birds, I had to get it. In my eyes, the worst that would happen would be getting a cute app I didn’t use. No harm no fowl (ehh?) but I’ve been using it consistently for over two months and I’ve already seen a huge difference. Obviously I’m not magically cured, and there’s still plenty of hard days, but having goals that an app keeps me accountable for is amazing. So, if you’re willing to take a chance on this app, I highly recommend.

It’s interface is cute and simple, the art is adorable, and it’s a good source of motivation. 10/10!!This app is delightful and useful. I’ve tried so many self care apps. I have ADHD and I’m autistic and didn’t learn about either until I was in my 30s. Taking care of myself under this new understanding has been a challenge but Finch is a great tool. 

Endlessly supportive and nonjudgmental, I love that it’s built to only award success but that the only consequence for not achieving your goals or doing the various activities is simply that you don’t progress unless you do stuff. No judgement if you miss a goal, no running into tasks that move to the next day, sitting there and judging. 

My only suggestion for improvement would be to allow tree town friends to exchange items as gifts or put up items in a “yard sale” where your tree town friends have 24 hours to buy stuff from you at the half-cost that you’d get by selling them back to mr prickles.This app is honestly one of the cutest, yet most meaningful apps I’ve encountered. It has forced me to set daily goals and really work to achieve them. The way you can pretty much journal anything you’re feeling or anything you may need to vent about is one of the best parts. The app keeps track of your moods throughout the day/week and allows you to go back and re-read over the things that may have caused you stress. The breathing exercises and the stretches offered are also a great way to keep your mental health (and also your body) in check. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who may need some help through bad days, or just help in general with mental health and keeping your head up through the hard times. Your little animal friend will always be on the journey with you, so you’re never alone! ♥️I love this app. I saw it in the App Store on the front page, and when I saw widget I decided to check it out. (Yes, the part that sparked my interest was widget.) I saw 5 stars and had to see what this was all about! I started reading and found out it was for self care. (Even better than I thought!) This is one of those things for me where you don’t know you needed it until you have it. This has helped me develop healthier habits, stay in contact with my friends and family through the good vibes in tree town, and overall become a better more observant person! I love raising my finch and completing goals with her. I love to see how often the developers reply, too. Most apps have one developer reply and everything else is ignored. Now whoever is still reading can see how great this app really is!This app is amazing! It helped me through so many hard times. The breathing techniques, goals, and journals are so helpful. Also, the notifications have helped me more than you can imagine. Nobody has ever told me “I’m here for you,” or “It’ll be okay.” Heck, no one has ever even known what I’ve been going through. I just feel so safe with this app and soo much less lonely. 

One recommendation I have for the app though is that we should be able to spend more time with our finch instead of them exploring all day. One of the most important reasons why I like this app is because it makes me feel like I’m not alone, like the Finch is here with me. And I feel like most mental health apps are just journals and reflections, and I don’t want that anymore - I just want to feel less lonely - so I wish to see us spend  more time with our finches. Thanks. 

Great work💕Personally, I download a lot of self care apps to find the best one. But overall this is the best. It feels like you and your little pet go through this self care journey together. Every time I open the app I get a burst of happiness to see my pet, Opal, coming back from an adventure or getting to dress her up. I also can create goals for the day and get rewarded for them which gives my pet energy for the adventures. This is such a fun self care app that I believe is perfect for me. It’s cute, fun, and inspiring with every time going into the app there’s a quote for that time of the day. Unlike other apps it’s free to track your feelings when you login and there’s a lot to this app that you can still do free! I love this app so much I’m thinking of even buying the premium version because it’s so beneficial to me. So I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a self care app.Let me start by saying, I’m a 16 year old sophomore in high school. Not only that but I have severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and I’ve endured a lot of trauma from being r*ped and being and domestic abuse relationship. I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental health problems for years and online journaling apps haven’t helped much and I never follow through with them. But with Finch I check In multiple times a day, I check on my friends and I complete goals and journal prints that help me feel better. I get rewards instantly for taking care of myself and doing something good for myself. I absolutely love this app and I thank the creators because you guys might have just saved my life and helped with my mental health so extremely much. I absolutely love LOVE this app and I cannot wait to continue using it and working on myself to let myself heal and grow! 
Thank you so much.I LOVE this app. It was recommended to me by a friend and I love it. It allows you to set goals and those goals help take care of your little finch and send them on adventures. It makes getting things done more motivating. 

I struggle with ADHD and depression, along with lack of motivation. This app makes getting things done like a game almost. This app also takes into account your different moods and if you’re having a really bad day or have trouble getting up in the morning, goals can be as simple as “literally surviving the day”. It’s better than a reminder app because the app in itself is supposed to help you better yourself. It comes with grounding techniques and breathing exercises.

The finch is adorable as well. You can name them, choose their pronouns and you can dress them up too. I just love it. I personally named mine CheesecakeOk my friend recommended me this app because I have some issues with motivation anxiety depression etc, and 1. Is has REAL not like buzzfeed crap but REAL tests to check your anxiety and depression levels. There are other tests but they cost premium but you don’t need them (or if you do you can probs find them elsewhere) The little bird is SOOOO. FLIPPIN. CUTE! I honestly think I am becoming emotionally attached to Kami, my bird. Decorating is so fun, but you have to earn gems to do so, which is good because you must comeplete goals or self reflect etc and honestly it has genuinely really helped me. (If the test recommends you a therapist though don’t use this app as makeshift therapy, get a therapist. I have a therapist and she approves of this) idk if I’m good at explaining or if it seems like I’m hyping up the wrong stuff, but genuinely get this app. 🌈🌈 ok bye! (Also it has pride merch <3)This app is so good. I use it every single day multiple times. Basically, you start off with a little bird (i’m pretty sure you hatch it), and you get to pick it’s name + pronouns. :) Then you can pick little daily goals and fill out little ‘reflections’. It can even ask you questions about your reflection afterward. (ex: reflection: i saw my friend Dan today. post-question: what is your favorite memory with Dan?) The post-question is completely optional but it’s fun sometimes. :) It also asks you about your mood when you open the app. You can write your dreams, rant, reflect, do breathing exercises, there’s a section for anxiety/when you’re panicking, I just love this app, it’s my favorite. It’s all around amazing. I use the free version and I still love it. The paid version gives you more options for reflections and such. I highly recommend this app. :))First off I hardly review apps but this feels like it needs to be said. OMG I LOVE THIS LIL BIRD!! This app was recommended to me by a close friend after I had a rough day. My god I’m so glad I got it. I like how even when you don’t finish goals or can’t check in with finch throughout the day it never Shames you or sends some wishy washy stuff like “Finch misses you come say hi!” No it send out things reminding you that you are loved and such.

Second I love the How you can’t really run out of rainbow rocks there’s always a small gift for you so you don’t lose motivation! I’m making trying to save up for a cute hat for my finch! (His name is cheesecake). 

All in all love this app 10/10 but I’ve noticed a lot of stuff aimed to adults who can drive and such. Possible add some goals for younger folks? Like “finish class work” “help someone out with their work” just a suggestion but still love it!Recently I’ve been struggling with motivation and taking care of myself—I’ve dealt with mental illness and while I’m certainly improving, it’s a slow process. The daily goals function is what I use most, and even if it’s just drinking water or doing ten jumping jacks, it always seems to put me back on track. The journal is a wonderful place to type something quick with no filter (especially in the morning when my brain’s not quite working yet), and more often than not I’ll laugh when I look back at what I wrote. It’s great. I’ve only had the app for a week or so but it’s the first self-care app I’ve tried that I don’t think I’ll ignore and forget immediately. You get to take care of a tiny bird AND yourself. What more could you need?

TLDR; somehow I’m emotionally invested in the childhood of a bird on a screen. Get the app.I've done gratitude journaling every single day for over 10 years now. While that helps me focus on what to be thankful for each day, this app does so much more for my overall mental and physical health. Some days I feel lazy, but my Finch pet motivates me to get up and move, think about positive things, address things that bother or worry me, appreciate my loved ones, and reminisce about past moments that brought me joy. The more I journal and reach my daily goals, the more my pet grows emotionally and physically. Such a great concept! Just opening this app up makes me happy because I get to see my little bird friend. The colors and graphics are so cute! I hope the developers add more clothing and accessories to the shop, because I'd like to have more variety in dressing up my pet. Thank you so much for creating this app! Keep up the awesome work.Finch is a game where you can raise a bird this bird will tell you almost everything they were going on adventures and other birds will be invited too! The other birds will be able to go on adventures with your bird too! It’s adorable. You can have multiple babies and have so much freedom you get to learn a lot and you can reflect you go also make your own goals. My goal is to at least have 100 goals for my birdie to finish in some of the goals you’ll be able to do exercises. Finch is the perfect game for people who do not have a big schedule, plus you unlock gifts and you’re Finch tells you about his/hers adventures, they will tell you about song they heard and things they found. And it’s really easy to get a lot of gems! There’s no way I would hate this game! I even have this on my IPad too! This was the best I’ve ever played!!!😀 - Yana JThis app was shown to me by my cousin and I loveee it!!! I never really had a problem with my life and what to do but when I got it I realize I was happier!! My day always had felt unfilled but when I got finch I felt so much more filled like I actually had a day and not sit on the couch and be bored😂
At first I didn’t really like how you had to buy thing with rainbow stones because I didn’t have that much and I wanted my finch to look cool but as I got more and more into the app I saw if you do more goals the more rainbow stones you get which meansss MY FINCH CAN LOOK COOLL🥳🥳🥳🥳 so if you don’t like how you finch is looking I would say to just try and try to do alot of goals, Reflections you can and you’d should be set!
I have had finch for over a year now and I have a teen finch sushi she/her and I would say you should definitely try it out! Have a buttery beautiful day!!:)I have tried many self care apps throughout the years. Normally after about a month I stop using them as they don’t work or are constantly asking for money to unlock different functions. Finch is simple but effective. I’m taking care of a little bird you take care of yourself. Simple questions such as “what’s on your mind?” Or “what’s living you up?” allow you to take a little time for yourself and reflect. Setting goals such as “reach out to a freind you haven’t talked with in a while” or “do laundry” or “stand up for 10s, we’ve all have those days”- again make you reflect and grow alongside your little finch. Highly recommend trying this app; the free version of this app is amazing but I would recommend paying if you truly like it to support the makers, designers, and artist who all worked on this app.Wow, I came across this app at a time when I needed it. It has been my saving Grace for mindfulness and processing difficult feelings- all while being connected to caring for a cute little bird. As a child of the 90s the nostalgia is on point. Adding friends to Tree town is reminiscent of Pokémon go, and having the option to change outfits etc reminds me of animal crossing … however the difference is that your your mental health and mindfulness is improved by reminders to complete daily tasks (I deal with executive dysfunction and having support in my daily goals is amazing) thank you for making this app. In a time when the world is going through war, pandemic, etc. This is something that is a gift and brings positivity into my life (and hopefully others) it’s simple, but it’s fantastic. Thank you to the developer. You have helped me help myself.This app is honestly the best thing i’ve ever used to keep myself motivated and on top of all my tasks.  it turns being productive into a game and it’s addicting. I fully expected to give up and lose interest in this app in the first month but i’ve been using it daily for almost a year now and it has changed my life for the better!  I now run two businesses and can use journeys to keep track of my tasks for each of them and it’s been so helpful to stay organized but also keep everything in one spot.  One thing I love to see as this app grows is having weekly goals in the sense that I have somethings that just need to get done at some point each week but the particular day doesn’t matter. Having a section for that right below the daily goals would be really awesome!I love this app. If you’re looking for a way to motivate yourself to write/ reflect on how you’re doing, or set goals & build habits, and you like cute things, this could be the app for you. Adorable little birds, and their growth & progress is directly related to how much you write, or stick to your other goals. 

Personally, I use the goals the most— it’s nice to start the day and set one or two manageable goals, and know that I’m actually able to do them. Favorite feature is probably the little push notifications from your bird (it’s not excessive and you can turn it off if that’s not your bag, but I love the little messages of encouragement), and when the birds skip when you give them extra energy. 

Keep in mind, it’s a small team of devs, so there are still a couple things being worked out, but they don’t interfere with the core functionality and benefits of the app, and they're really active with the community. (Community is also fantastic & really supportive). Save data is all local to your device, so you know they’re not selling it, and all my interactions with the team have been great so far. 

Overall, this is a great app to try if you want to carve out a little more time for yourself, and respond well to gamifying things you need to do.This app has improved my mental health and helps me be productive. It has some ideas for journeys and goals, but you can also add your own. This app also reminds when to do things (for example cleaning a fish tank). The finches are so cute and I love how you can customize them to your liking, and they grow and discover new things as you take care of yourself. The free version gives you everything that you need, and the payed one there are some extra features. This app also has such a kind community. There are people called “guardians” who give a few dollars so that people who can’t afford Finch Plus can get it. This is a truly, truly great app, thank you for making this. Anyone who wants to be in a little more of a better place or simply a cute app to keep track of things, this is it.I love this app so much! I recommend it to pretty much everyone I have a conversation with because I love that it’s prioritizing your self care and personal goals in a way tailored to you, all while adventuring and growing the cutest little bird! I love the little outfits I can dress her up into and the themes of the months have been adorable! I’ve been using this app every day since I got it mid November (just barely missing the hedgehog 🥺) but have been obsessed since! I am always looking forward to seeing what the adventure entailed for the day and reflecting on my highs and lows of the week! The journal prompts are awesome to just pop a question in your head and feel it out it makes me feel consistent and accountable for myself! 10/10 will always recommend! Thank you for creating an awesome app and keeping up with it!Tying personal mental health and motivation with a game seems like a bad idea, but it’s honestly helped a lot. You can set reminders for your daily goals, and if you reach enough of your daily goals your finch will go on adventures. When your finch returns from its adventures you will receive currency, which you can use to get accessories for your finch, as well as some other prizes. As you progress you’ll be able to level up and get access to more features of the app. I’m only on level one, so I’m not sure what all of the features do, but they seem fun. Every time you open the app, an inspirational quote will pop up on your screen, and you will be asked to rate how you’re feeling on a scale of 1-5. It’s quick and easy and the quotes are those kind of cheesy, useless quotes, they’re actually motivational.Love this app so much! I’ve been using it for 3 days and everyday I have been ready to go super early and I am so motivated. You get to hatch a little birb right away and you can pick from a variety of colors, I picked purple because it’s my favorite color. You also name your birb and tell it your name and your birthday in settings when your all signed in. 10/10 recommend downloading this if your struggling getting back into habits or struggling to be ready on time. Every time you finish one of your goals it’s gives you rainbow stars basically and you can use those to buy clothes and other little things. Your birb goes on an adventure everyday and take 8 hours to complete it but you can still do other things on the app while your little birb is adventuring. You birb does grow from baby to toddler and so on. Enjoy!I absolutely love the format of the app. I love the reflection prompts, the dialogue from your bird after adventures, the customization of your bird’s outfit and room, and the way your bird grows. I feel like there’s an abundance of content and features between the deep dives, movements and breath work, journeys and goals, ect. This is one app that I’ve been able to come back to consistently and I feel has actually improved my mental health somewhat, despite only having the free version. One small feature I miss is being able to make a list or collection of thoughts that I can come back to and reference or add to. For example, a group of things to bring up in therapy or questions to ask. Having more movements added and possibly guided meditations would be other great features, but again, there’s already a lot of content!I don’t usually feel strongly enough about an app to leave a review, but Finch became the most steadfast part of my routine within days. I’m in love with with my little pet-slash-cheerleader and OBSESSED with the UI of this app. 

I’ve never had much luck with habit trackers or self-care apps before, even other gamified ones - I tend to use them religiously for a week or two at best and then completely forget they’re on my phone. But Finch is different. I haven’t missed a singe day in 38 days and counting! (And how could I, when I know my bird buddy’s in there waiting to say hello?)

It has pretty much everything I’ve ever wanted in one of these apps: well-organized goals, journaling prompts, a mood tracker, guided exercises (!!!) and so. Much. Customizable. Content. It almost feels like I’m building the app as I’m using it, tailoring it to my needs instead of trying to work with what it can offer.  

And the best part is that the subscription is actually affordable - and that, even without paying for it, the app has plenty of functionality that makes it well worth using for free. I simply cannot recommend Finch enough. I suggested it to a friend and she purchased the subscription within a day of using it! Thanks, devs, for all your hard work. It shows.I have tried DOZENS of mental health apps, but nothing has helped me the way this app has. I’m on the free version, and it’s incredible! Most apps like this I last 3 days max on, but this app has kept my attention for a long time. 

The app has a cute pet you can get attached to and interact with! That helps me want to open the app. The suggested goals are honestly so small (like one being get out of bed, stand up for 10 seconds) to bigger ones to help with confidence and kindness. In the short time I’ve used the app, I’ve noticed I’m way more patient and kind then what I was before, and I used to get angrier quicker than what I do now. Whenever I feel upset, I just open the app and play around with its features, and it calms me down unlike anyone or anything has before. It’s amazing what this app has done for me!Usually I don’t stay on apps for more than a month. Like a certain app with a owl 🦉… I’ve also never written a app review. But this app? It has truly helped me. I’ve been on it now for over 100 days. I don’t know if I have the words to describe just how amazing it is. All in one, there’s a place to vent, listen to soundscapes, access to helplines, create goals, practice breathing techniques, get support and encouragement, and have a little buddy to support you along the way. This app has helped me when I had no one to talk to and felt like no one was there. If you are thinking of downloading the app, do it, it’s free with tons of resources. Im not getting paid to write this, I’m just someone who is struggling and had found help in this app. And if you are struggling, pls know you aren’t alone and it’s ok to ask for help.Edit: I can’t find anywhere to submit suggestions for this app so I’ll include them here… Having a dark mode would be very beneficial, especially for Reflection entries. The bright white background hurts my eyes when I jot something down before bedtime. Also I think it would be helpful to go back and edit emotions in the How Are You Feeling Right Now feature… sometimes I select one option without really evaluating how I’m feeling, then wish I had picked something else. Still loving this app!!

I have only had this app for about a day and I already feel so much more positive! It helps with setting goals, practicing gratitude, and tracking daily progress for tasks and habits. Definitely a must-have for someone with executive functioning difficulties, or really anyone who needs a bit more positivity in their life.I found a video on my tiktok for you page we’re someone was talking about this app and I initially just brushed it off since I wasn’t very interested, but I went back and saw the video again and got intrigued. I checked out the app in the App Store and was shocked to see all five star reviews. I was skeptical since most apps like that tend to be just okay with a lot of fake reviews but after downloading the app and using it for over an hour I’m hooked. The lil bird is absolutely amazing and all the goals are things I can actually achieve in one day. The app doesn’t immediately tell you to buy the premium version or play adds so I really enjoy that. I ended up doing a bunch of reflections and setting goals for myself to meet today and tomorrow. 

Sorry that I’m rambling a lot but I genuinely enjoy this app and it’s helping me already!This app is a really good tool for self care! At first I was hesitant because I didn’t know if I’d remember to open the app and use it… but growing the pet and sending it on adventures motivates me to completely my goals and come back to the app. The goal setting feature is very useful because I can make goals based off the day, or daily goals. The goals help me remember to do things throughout the day and rewards me for doing the goals. I also have learned a lot about myself with the app. I learned I like stretching before bed because it makes me feel relaxed… the app has a feature when you can follow along with a stretching video. I also love the reflections because the app picks up on key words and you can see how many positive or negative words you use. I only have the free version but it still gives you so much!I’ve always loved pet games. Something about raising and playing with a little animal friend has always made me smile. Combine that with being an app to help encourage me to work towards my goals, this is the perfect app for me. My therapist recommended it to me last week and since then I’ve been checking in on my little bird friend multiple times a day and achieving my small goals much more frequently. I’ve always struggled with my mental health and lately it’s been getting harder and harder to do even the smallest things. But if picking up a bit of my clothes or doing a small exercise means I can get my cute baby a new sweater, I find it a little easier. The app gives gentle encouragement and has a lot of great tools and suggested goals and projects to help you move in the right direction. I highly recommend.I don’t usually write reviews on things, but this app is a must, for anyone. If you’re like me, you might know how hard it is to ask yourself questions regarding how you’re feeling or about the things around you. This app helps you communicate by asking you the questions and by you writing them down, which helps to keep ideas and emotions flowing. There are goals you can put in place, quizzes to see how you’re feeling and where you might be placed on a scale, breathing exercises, stretches, optimistic sayings, journals, journeys you can set up to better your mental health, and the list goes on. This app has changed how I see things and has got me thinking about things I usually would have preferred to not think about. So thank you. I appreciate the app for caring and the people reading this for considering it.this is totally different than any other self care app i have tried!! Most everything is free and the only premium only things are a few outfits and quizzes and it does not have any negative impact! i love how you can set unlimited goals with schedules and reminders and you get prizes for completing them! it also gives you a rundown of how you were feeling based on rants and reflections every week and gives you a chart with all of your emotions during the months which is great!! And so many great features!! i have had this app pretty much since it released and i still love it! i hope this one isnt taken over by premium only content too!! You can also go into the settings to make the app locked with face id or a password if you feel uncomfortable with people snooping through your rantsI’ve only been on Finch for a week now, but it is hands down the best self help app I have ever had (and I’ve tried quite a few). There is no pressure to upgrade to the premium version, and plenty of features can be accessed through the free version. Myself and all my friends are on it and regularly send hugs and healthy reminders back and forth. It has helped me reflect on a lot of things that I’ve never thought to. I get excited to log on the app, it doesn’t feel like a chore. My little bird is so cute and I love gaining currency to buy her clothes. There are so many resources and encouragement for tough days, and the goals you set help to remind you that even the little things are progress. I absolutely recommend it for everyone! It has been a game-changer for me coming out of a depressive episode.I don’t normally leave reviews for apps, but I feel strongly that I need to for this one. 

As a student with adhd, depression, anxiety, etc. it can be hard to function. I have tried so many different things and systems, but nothing has worked for me. I get overwhelmed easily and can never stick with something. 

This app is the first thing that works for me! I give myself a couple of goals per day (not too many!) I’ll always do some that I know for certain will get completed (for example, washing my face or getting out of bed) so that I always have something to check off at the end of the day. 

I mostly use the app for smaller self-care related goals, but if I have a major task I *need* to get done that day, I’ll add that too. 

Overall, it’s a fun and lovely app. I love the notifications that it sends when I haven’t been on in a bit. They make me smile and cheer me up! The only thing I would change is that I wish there were a few more goal options with the free version. I like selecting goals from a list (vs thinking of them myself), but those are pretty limited for the free version. Otherwise, I have no negative feedback!! 

Tldr; great app, cute and lovely, helpful for people who struggle to stick to things, would recommendThank you for making this app! If I had not downloaded it, I probably would've kept missing out on an easy way to motivate myself into doing a lot of things while keeping focused! I'd originally ignored this app when it 1st came out & was advertised. Thinking it was dumb & wouldn't work. But it does! & the bird is Sooo Cute! Users can set goals to complete while earning energy to have their pet go on an adventure for the day, but the productivity doesn't have to end there; I've already gotten him to discover something today, but that doesn't mean I've to stop setting goals! Whatever goals are completed after are converted to the app's currency so users can work towards buying stuff while accomplishing their goals & it's 100% productive in game & out!!! Thank You So Much!!!I absolutely love the Finch app. It’s like Tamagotchi without the stress and it motivates me to take care of myself, so it’s a win on all fronts. Using it as much as I do, there are a couple things I’d like to see in the next bug fix:

1. When I add new goals, my list of goals gets shuffled. I have them organized roughly by time of day, and I’ve got tons of them, so it’s a bit annoying to have to resort thirty-forty goals. Thankfully, they seem stick after that first resort, but if I add another goal, it goes again.

2. The stretching exercise example clips sometimes flash a black screen before restarting. It’s not a concern for me, but I don’t know if it could potentially be a trigger for folks with seizures.

3. On the topic of stretching exercises, I think it would be cool to have some written instructions for stretching as well, namely where you’re supposed to feel the stretch. I often wonder if I’m doing the stretch right on the ones I’m not familiar with!

I attempted to use the Report Issue feature for these notes, but that button didn’t seem to be working, so that’s another one. These don’t change my rating because I truly love this app and think it’s phenomenal! Just a couple things I’ve noted in the almost three months I’ve used it. 😊I didn’t even get this app for my mental health I just wanted to have the pet bird 😂. But in all honesty it’s actually making me do things that are good for me. I want the bird to feel energized so I set goals and write reflections. I started off doing small goals like doing my laundry, cooking food, or washing the dishes. Then I started getting on the app when I was anxious or feeling upset and it actually did help me. Before I realized it I was writing paragraphs about how I felt and it felt nice writing it down, understanding myself better, and letting go of the emotions that didn’t serve me. When I’d be alone with my strong anxiety the exercises they offer actually calm me down and take my mind off of those issues. I normally struggle being alone because of these thoughts but the app kind of helped me be okay with being alone.I don’t say this easily about an app, but this one really is life changing. I found it through a Facebook ad one day and thought it might be helpful with battling my ADHD, without medications while symptoms are a bit strong (sometimes symptoms get super intense when I’m under a lot of stress). I never would have imagined that this app would help me keep going after losing my grandma, who was more my mother. Finch helped me to stay on track using my journeys and daily goals to remind myself to take a shower, eat, even to take the dog out, so I could keep track of everything. They’ve only continued to help and get better. The app paired with the awesome Facebook community where developers post upcoming updates on the app… it’s changed my life. It kept me going when I really wasn’t sure if I could or how.I started off with the free trial and it’s really helped me get back on top of my responsibilities. Completing the goals and even adding my own goals has really helped me feel like I’ve gotten things back on track, even if it’s a simple as drinking water. 

I recently started going to therapy for anxiety and found that keeping track of things really keeps me in the loop of my own life. I also play a lot of games on my phone, I am ADD and have shown small signs of autism. Having a “game” as well as goals/checklist has really combined the two things I enjoy to help me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone who is maybe on the same end as I am but also to anyone who wants a much more fun way to make sure you’re reaching the small but helpful goals you want to reach.Like other reviewers, I have not had success with any other apps like I have with this. I have used this for over a week, and it has turbocharged my days so that I can do way more. My favorite thing is looking through the list of goals and picking and adding them. Because of this, I would like a pool of goals that’s 100x bigger, or some kind of tool to generate goal ideas. As far as what I would change, I wish that the goals naturally arranged themselves, or were easier to keep them arranged or categorized by time of day. Even as simple as morning - day - night! That’s so I don’t have to scroll through my list of 25 goals and seeing if I missed any that I could do right now. To be honest, I would ditch this app if I found a habit tracker app that could do these.You don’t have to pay for it there is an option for plus and there are no ads. With the option for plus it doesn’t shove it in your face like most and it still lets you do AN AMAZING amount of stuff and i recommend it! It is a 11 out of 10!!!!! For me it helps with anxiety, depression, sleeping, breathing, panic attacks, regulating my emotions, and reflecting on things. It also really helps with brushing my teeth because I’m really bad at that with my anxiety and depression and stuff but it helps because you can see your goals in front of you which really helps me because I’m a visual person. Also the “birb” your pet is So CUTE I just love it and you can have it be called they/them or she/her and he/him which I think is beneficial and just really great for people who like to do that. YOU SHOULD GET IT! (Real person lol)This app is the best. I’ve been using it for just over a week now and I feel more motivated and energized than I have in awhile. You set daily/weekly goals for yourself, and every time you check one off for the day, you energize your little finch. Once you’ve checked off so many he/she/they go on an adventure and come back with a new experience! It motivates you to complete more goals and keeps you on track with even the smallest of things (like getting out of bed or brushing your teeth). Your goals don’t have to be difficult because even making the time for smaller goals throughout the day makes you feel like you’re accomplishing things. LOVE IT. The only thing I’d change is that someday I hope we can send our finches out on multiple adventures a day!!I started using this app when I was in a dark place in my life— I was highly unmotivated, I wasn’t that happy of a person… but Finch has definitely helped with a lot of this. 

This app has helped give me motivation to do many different tasks in a day, whether they were major or minor because I would want to get new clothes for my bird (Astro) or get him new furniture. 

And plus, the game is so cute overall. Opening the app always gives me a little smile. 

One thing though— maybe there should be another way to earn gems besides completing tasks? Because each individual task only gives you about 3-5 gems, and it takes multiple days to unlock gems for when you cleared a certain number of journey days. Personally, I think more minor tasks such as making your bed could be about 10 gems, and more major tasks such as vacuum cleaning your room could be 15-20.

Maybe there could be another event system, like a leaderboard where you can get gems depending on how many goals you’ve achieved. Or, it could be like this but with friends— the friend with the most number of goals cleared can earn a number of gems.

Otherwise, this game is so adorable and I can’t wait to grow Astro. Thank you!I really enjoy this app and it has helped me do the basic tasks that I struggle with because of executive dysfunction from ADHD. I have a couple of suggestions that could improve the app. First, I want to agree with another review that suggested a way to make the goals pop up in order every day so I don’t have to manually change them every day. Second, it would be helpful if the finch day ended later, maybe 3am, rather than midnight. I like to do the evening stretches right before bed, but they don’t show up because I do them after midnight, and then the next morning I see them counting for the new day that technically started at midnight. It would be helpful for the “day” to count as 3am to 3am so that those of us who go to bed late can keep our days organised properly.I don’t know if I’ve ever written an app review but I will write a million for this sweet app. I have always struggled with mental health and keeping goals until this app. I even always brush my teeth twice a day even when I’m depressed and tired. Y’all have created magic!! Haha :)

I had a stroke a handful of years ago in my late 20s which has left me a different person. This app has helped me take slow mindful steps each day towards achievable goals. My birb really does feel like a best friend, much like my tamagotchi did back in the day haha, but there’s no stress in the upkeep. It’s the first thing I do when I wake up and the last thing before I go to sleep. The new reward challenges are so cute and fun and give me another reason to show up daily. My pet having a pet??? Cmon how could it get any better? I love it so much. 

The free version offers so much and I truly hope they keep it that way!! The paid version is reasonable but unfortunately is out of my pricing limit right now. Anyways. I love this app and I am so so grateful to have found it! Now when can I do a build a birb and get my own real life plushy?? ;) 

Thank you with all my being to the developers, you’ve seriously given me a new lease on life!I’ve never used an app that was more helpful. You can set daily goals that give your little friend energy to go on adventures so it’s a great way to motivate you to complete them. There are tons of breathing tools and mindfulness practices to help with anxiety and other things. And the best part is it’s VIRTUALLY FREE!!!! Like you don’t need to buy anything to enjoy and get a ton out of the app. However that being said you do have the option to pay and it opens up a bunch of customization tools, but the app is just as enjoyable without. So don’t worry about that. My life went from jobless, depressed, messy, and anxious to productive, happy, and I actually get excited to wake up in the morning and start working on my daily goals. I couldn’t recommend this app enough. It’s honestly changed my life.I don’t ever take the time to review apps because I’ve never liked apps enough to do so. However, Finch is very deserving of a five star review and an app review because of the quality of the app, and all that comes along with it. I’ve tried countless apps similar to this (specifically mindfulness, breathing apps, etc) and none of them have helped at all. Then comes Finch, an app that not only offers everything I’ve been looking for in a mental health app, but I also get to look after a little bird and as an avid bird lover, this is great! 

I love all that Finch has to offer and am so grateful to have been referred to it through an autism group I am apart of on FB. I enjoy watching my little Finch grow, go on adventures with other little Finch friends and the best part about it is in order for my Finch to grow up, I have to actively participate in the app by completing the goals I have set so it keeps me on track. 

This app deserves more attention and I’m so grateful to have been introduced to it. Thank you to Finch’s creators, developers and everyone else involved because it’s been life changing for me and I am forever appreciative of all that you’ve done to create and launch this app. 

My little Nooblett and I send love and hugs 😁😁😆I actually really enjoy this app. I had several other apps to try and help me develop good habits, but most I gave up within a few days. Turns out they were boring for me! I’ve been using this app daily for a little over two months and I love it! The idea of allowing you to take care of a pet/friend that you interact with is fun and reminds me much of a video game (which I enjoy). I like to think of my goals of the day as “missions/ quest” one might get in games and when they’re completed I get rewarded with gems/energy that allows me to get more fun clothes for my finch. So I’m motivated to try and get as many, and a lot of time: all, of my goals done! It also has other things such as mood tracking, journaling, stretching idea, and breathing exercises. I really recommend this app overall!I have downloaded a LOT of self-help/anxiety apps and let me just say that they helped little to none, but this one I was immediately intrigued with because it had a cute animal to take care of that’s kind of like Tamagachi AND it’s like an emotional support pet so it’s a win win for anybody who wants to have a pet but can’t afford one or doesn’t want to take care of the hard work! 

I didn’t expect it to be this much fun and exciting to actually write my thoughts and feelings down. And the fact that everyday when you log in and put down your goals, the little fellow levels up each time is such a bonus because it’s like they’re growing with you! This is such a unique idea and definitely something a lot of anxiety/journal apps don’t have! Thank you for creating this app 💜💜💜When I first on this I do anything and I saw this ad and it was about like I don’t remember the ad was but it was nice. Found it interesting about how to check in. It help you with your to like hit your goals and it’s been about like a year or two since I got this app and it’s literally so helpful and it’s just inspired me to To do like more daily task and you know level up so I can like travel more places with my pepperoni that’s the name of my chicken and I dress her and you know I just like make her happy in general and login and I love having Daily Streak. It also allows you to have journaling, and just tell her, but your experience in general, and it gives you points for that. I really suggest getting this app if you’re struggling or just need motivation.My 13-year-old niece sent me an invite to use this app and I originally did so just as a favor to her and to be supportive of her efforts to keep up with her goals and improve her mood. I recently lost my husband of 20 years and am still grieving and dealing with several physical disabilities as well and low and behold, I discovered that even though this app is geared for a younger audience, the little baby animal reminds me of child and the joy it expresses in it “discoveries” at the end of each day reminds me to find the wonder and innocence in life and in moments where my adult eyes my otherwise forget to notice it. It's reminding me that it's ok to dream and relax and BREATHE and smile now and then. 
It's just a little app, but it's done a world of good and helped to mend this broken, bleeding heart of mine.I love this app so much! I love checking in on my finch and even got my sisters and aunt to play. It’s really nice because you can set your own goals and if you get busy during the day your finch goes on an 7-8 hour adventure you can power/skip through, or you can just let them be. I highly recommend this app. Now go download it! ＼＼\\٩( 'ω' )و //／／

[EDIT:I like the addition of the pride representation in this app, it really lets you be who you want and make a character that you are happy with. They let you choose their (your character’s) pronouns and you can buy (with gems you collect) pride flags. The pride flags have a wide variety, even the disability and autism flags are included. I really like this part of the app even though I’m not a part of the LGBTQIA+ community.I never write reviews but Jesus Mary and Joseph does this one need it. I LOVE THIS APP SK MUCH A WENT ON MY 30 PERSIN GROUO CHAT AND MADE EVERYONE DOWNLOAD IT. The free version is incredible, there’s NO ads which is amazing. The free version has almost the same amount of things as the paid version but you don’t have access to some of the exercises. I plan on buying the plus version just because of how much I love this app. It helps me every day and I owe a huge thank you to whoever made this for basically saving my life. ALSO STOP CALLING ME OUT WITH THE RECCOMENDED GOALS OF LIKEliterally live through the day” I looked at that and was like okay who is watching me through my phone. Cut the cameras. Overall I give this app infinity out of 5. Love everything about this app it’s so so so worth it. Blessed be everyone <3I can’t wait to see what the Finch team does with the look and design of this app because that’s honestly one of the only things I think can be made better. Though I wish there were more settings for goals like “until it’s done” or something, the lack of that helps me break my goals into smaller pieces. I love helping my finch grow and sending things to other people that might make them feel better. They also offer free plus for members who can’t afford it (like me) which helps a lot when I need more that 5 minutes of a breathing exercise. Overall, it’s a good app for goal tracking, has a lot of exercises that can help maintain wellness, and seems to genuinely care about its users. The motivation of wanting to help my finch grow makes all that even better.This app has helped me a lot during high anxiety moments. The breathing exercises definitely help when a can’t calm down. I also love how you can make friends with other finches and send good vibes. I think it’s adorable and is a good way of keeping me motivated to keep using the app and completing my goals. Also the lil finch is adorable and I love growing her. 

There is one thing, though, and i think it came with the most recent update. The lil store where you buy clothes for your finch is kinda glitched out and instead of there being items where they are usually, it’s like, a grey box covering the area. I’ve tried closing and reopening the app and turning my phone off and on again and it didn’t work, so I’m assuming it’s a bug.

Outside of that, this is an amazing app. I’d recommend it for everyone.I just started finch a few days ago, but ever since I got finch it had helped me get a better life style. It has been so much getting to create my own character and give it a home. Something else that has been super awesome is that there are no ads even if you don’t have the plus package (which I don’t) and just today that gave me a 3 day free plus sample and it has been amazing but it’s also amazing with out plus. In the app when you start you get to set goals for yourself to complete every day and you can add goals or get rid of some if it is too much. Finch has helped me with my anxiety and focusing more on things. Finch has also helped me get a better routine throughout my day. I really recommend this to everyone even if they don’t have bad problems.😁Great for getting out of a bad place. Setting goals, calming down, ranting your thoughts away, and a small friend to take care of. Your finch has unique and refreshing perspectives on seemingly ordinary things, and you can customize them endlessly. This app is wonderful. Also it’s lgbtq+ inclusive, with pride flags and clothing, as well as pronoun selection for your finch. It’s a very good app for those who struggle with their mental health, as it is kind and reassuring while gently promoting progress for your self esteem, energy, and self awareness. It has built in quizzes to check up on depression and anxiety symptoms as well as resources for you to calm your negative feelings in the first aid section. They don’t guilt you or irritate you into buying anything, and there are no ads. All around a wonderful app. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I absolutely adore this app. It provides gentle reminders to perform a wide variety of self-care tasks for yourself and for the ones you love. Everything about this app is so thoughtfully designed. The prompting to write is non-judgemental and really allows you to put as little or as much effort in as you feel up to on a given day. The deep breathing exercises and the “SOS tool kit” and “First Aid Kit” that pop up when you report you’re having a difficult day have been really great to re-evaluate how I am feeling and change my outlook. The finches themselves are so cute, too - it’s like having a little pet that loves you unconditionally. If you need support on completing goals or taking time to process how you’re feeling and care for your day to day needs, you will love this app. ❤️i have never written a review for an app before. this app, though, is genuinely the best thing i’ve ever come across. it is helpful, guided, and fun at the same time. i’ve been struggling a lot lately and i’m able to set goals in a way that helps me AND my little bird. having alternative goals like simply saving up for a cute outfit for my bird is incredibly helpful for me, as i struggle to actually make progress if the goal only benefits me. on top of that, while there is a paid subscription, the amount of things that you have access to simply with the free app is ridiculous, and the app is absolutely amazing. there is so much detail and care put into this app, and it shows. by far the best self-help app i’ve ever come across, and i have been searching FOREVER.Finch is one of the best apps ever. It’s a great way to accomplish your goals and give you motivation to do so. You can create your own, or choose from a list of everyday goals. Also, there no annoying ads that you have to pay for to go away. You don’t even need Wi-Fi to use it! You check in on friends and family, and send them helpful reminders. When your finch goes on adventures, they come back with adorable stories that you can respond to. And don’t get me started on how cute your character is. Just adorable. Also, random idea, I think it would be cool if you could make a micropet that looks like finch user’s real pets! We could send a photo by email, and give out a name, and that could be a pet that hatches from Professor Oat. That would be really fun to see!I’ve never paid for a year subscription on an app. Until I got Finch. When I tell you this lil bird has helped me close the gap between the person I am and the person I want to be, I mean it. Not only does it help with mindfulness, I’ve been using it extensively for habit forming and it’s been extremely helpful. It’s great to have someone encourage you to achieve your goals without needing to depend on an actual person. I made all my friends download it and not all of them have gotten the same out of it. Having the widget really helps me remember to talk to my bird and look at my goals. 

Not to mention the developers are amazing and truly care about their user base! They take suggestions and have built a wonderful community. If I could give Finch 6 stars, I would.This app has brought so much joy to my anxiety-ridden daily life. My little Baby Finn is adorable and I love the concept of raising him by completing self care and seeing his personality grow.
One thing that I would like to mention - I’ve only had this app for a few days, at first I could let him go adventuring whenever his energy was full, but yesterday I could only send him on one adventure in the morning. Can you only do one per day? I finished a lot of goals last night and this morning he only had half of his energy despite it being full at bedtime. He was asleep at bedtime but his mood was curious during the day with full energy.
Other than that, I can see myself using this long term and I am grateful to the developers for creating this wonderful app!I love finch ever since my friend introduced it to me, I have been 20x more on track w my goals before this app I was not doing well on keeping track w my goals (personal life ykn ykn) but after I got finch I could write down my goals and that app would always be there to remind me that I still have goals to do! My finch is an adult and she unlocked her travel agency but I do wish there was more travels at first I thought if I refresh I could go to the specific country but it wasn’t there, I was hopping for my birb to travel to Mexico but then i never found Mexico I refreshed a lot of times until I either didn’t have gems or I couldn’t, other than that I love the places you can travel to but I’d like more places to travel please!I have bounced between a variety of selfcare & productivity apps, usually getting overwhelmed by having to have multiple apps for journaling, mood tracking, habit forming, breathing exercises, etc! It is amazing to have ONE app that fits all of these into one experience, AND gives me a sweet little Finch to be responsible for in the process. I feel motivated to take care of myself, because I feel like I am taking care of this virtual pet in turn! 
I enjoy that everything is in one place for this app, with the click of a widget I can easily check off my goals for the day, reflect on how I'm feeling, and even track my daily mood! The insights & weekly newsletters help me see how I'm doing, and genuinely this is just the best self care app I've had to this date.I have struggled to break out of depressive episodes for my entire life. Tried so many different apps to track my moods and hold myself accountable. I can’t explain it, but my little bird has been not only helping me stay on top of the self care habits that have been so difficult for me maintain, but I’ve also learned so much about myself and feel I’ve made permanent changes to the way I function. I’ve realized through setting tiny, achievable goals that I have a tendency to set myself up for failure by looking too far ahead and telling myself I can’t possibly do it. Taking it one little step at a time with an adorable, encouraging little friend walking alongside me has genuinely been life changing for me. 125 days in and I’m so so proud of myself. Give it a try 🥰i love this app so much, it really helps me keep track of goals and take care of myself! 

i do sorta wish it had a dbt (dialectal behavioural therapy) section or feature because i think those skills are also really helpful and should be more easy to access. i also think it would be nice if it asked you more mood questions when you open the app (maybe about how tired you are, how focused, etc.). i do think it would be cool if there was a sort of “comfort” option when you are feeling down that you would be able to curate, with like cute animal videos and pictures and stuff like that.

but overall this app is wonderful and SO adorable!! i love putting outfits on my finch and interacting with him!I think this was exactly what I needed. I saw an ad for this on TikTok and I thought “well, I can at least try it out.” Before finch, I usually would make a to-do list on paper for days ahead and doing it on my phone on finch is a lot easier. There are goals to set up— little ones too that don’t seem so hard. I’ve tried out the stretches and the breathing exercises and I love the little reminders on push notifs that tell you nice things. This little bird is exactly what I needed and I think that it also helps to type in and reflect on your life so that you can gain clarity into maybe why you feel the way that you do. I don’t have the full subscription but I think it would definitely be worth it. This actually helps. Thank you so much for making this.Finch has helped me more than I thought it would honestly. I have trouble sometimes being productive and really getting the most out of my day. I work all the time and the past year haven’t really had time to myself. However downloading Finch has helped me prioritize and set little goals for myself in a way that doesn’t overwhelm me. And caring for my bird has in a way given me a further motivation to achieve my small goals. Even if they’re as little as drinking water throughout the day or making my bed. The check ups throughout the day and little motivational memos are a cute touch that really help on days I’m struggling. Thank you to the Finch team and everyone else involved in keeping it running. You are truly appreciated❤️Thankfully, I am for the most part on the other side of my mental health struggles and have been doing well. However, sometimes its really easy to go back to old habits, so a month ago I downloaded the app. This app helps me so much with that. My goals help me keep fit, because exercise is something that helps me a lot. And honestly just the little check ins every time I open the app has helped me wayy more than I ever thought it would. I love that I can reflect on any of my goals, no matter how little it is. This app is incredible and I love what the developers stand for. It has helped me keep my progress and continue to live without having to worry to much about mental illness anymore. If you struggle with mental illness then I would HIGHLY recommend this app.This is so good I have no words you can sign up for a seven day free trial but you don’t have to. You are able to do this for free but some things will be locked because of the subscription. It helped me reach my goals and my cute friend motivated me to do these things! There are many opportunities for free like different breathing activities and different stretches for different things! There are sounds to halo you relax. You can write down how you feel. You can even buy different clothes and accessories for your new friend! The currency is rainbow gems. You can also decorate your house from the currency! There is more I haven’t even said! I highly recommend this app  because it will help your mental and physical heath and well being. Recommend fully! 💕💕💕I love this app and use it daily for journaling, tasks, goals, and insights.

Things I love:

- Easy to use and engaging.
- Great built-in goals and activities.
- Awesome insights and stats.
- Helpful journaling prompts.

What I wish they’d add/change:

- Make it possible to add “optional” goals or mark a goal as “not applicable” when needed (example: work goals aren’t applicable on holidays).

- Hidden posts/notifications for sensitive goals or entries. This would allow us to customize how certain goals show up in notifications and give us an option to hide entries (maybe an eye icon you tap to reveal).

- Make it so we can communicate or share certain posts with tree town friends. It would also be cool if we could post a status update. This could be very helpful for things like addiction sponsors and reaching out.

- Better formatting and labeling. Some prompts are labeled, others are not. Also, paragraphs get removed when you edit a reflection. Would be cool if we could add photos and links. Would also be nice if we could bold text to create headers.

- Improve tags to include more categories and actions.

Overall, I love this app! Thank you so much for all of your hard work on creating it.I finally was able to find a person care app that actually works for me, I’ve tried so many and just felt like they were a waste and a scam but this one set small realistic goals I can actually meet everyday til I decide to take on more. It’s improved my mental health, it’s taken away that overwhelming feeling if I don’t do enough, I’ve been able to take better care of myself and keep motives by actually seeing how much I’m doing in one day. I’m in love with it. I use the breathing guides at night and it have other tasks that help my horrible sleep schedule. The most interesting thing I’ve found that I have used yet was the “first aid” which helps with grounding yourself in panic attacks and helps you identify trigger which I’m excited to get to use.This is one of the best apps ever, no exaggerating. As of writing this review, I’ve had the app for a few hours, so I don’t yet know all of the things this app has to offer, but it is an amazing app. I was feeling really bad, and saw this app when looking for more self care apps, and this has been the best one. Within minutes I was feeling much better! My finch is non-binary (like me), and their name is Mushu! They’re so cute, and they make me smile every time I see the widget. The goals and reflections on other apps always feel like chores and make me feel worse, but this app made me feel like it was a fun thing to do, and I couldn’t stop smiling doing most of these. One things is for sure, and that is that this app will be used by me for years to come!I have struggled my whole life to spend time being mindful, journaling or taking time for myself and my needs. My therapist has been trying so hard to help me reach these goals to no avail. I have struggled with extreme guilt when taking care of myself, but I was made for taking care of others. Finding finch is the best thing that could have happened. Hatching my baby penguin Noodles made me completely full of joy. I wanted to take care of him and watch him grow, but that meant I needed to take care of myself too. Noodles gets to go on adventures only if I spend time reflecting, affirming and reaching my goals. I feel motivated, I feel inspired, I feel happy and am making more time for myself than I ever have in my life! Thank you so so much to the creators.This is the first app I've ever loved enough to write a review of. I've struggled with depression for years, and in turn struggled with self care. My depression has gotten much better, but I developed some poor self care habits. I've seen lots of apps advertised as health or self care apps, and none of them ever came close to being helpful. THIS APP TRULY IS! I feel so motivated and proud of myself. I love how they make the goals small and manageable in a way that makes sense in my brain. And the interface is so nice and easy to use. Seriously this app has so many abilities and little tools they thought of everything. I use the free version and I really appreciate that I can still get 100% fulfillment without needing the premium, and they dont push the membership on you too hard.I’ve found this app an encouraging and useful way to track my journey in mental healing. There are a couple of small bugs here and there but its mostly just related to icons and visuals, I’ve never run into anything that impacted functionality. In speaking of functionality, it’s impressive how many useful features such a small team was able to include in this app. I’m by no means great at using it daily but having the encouragement of friends when I do log in is very motivating. There is a variety of activities available plus the ability to add your own goals and tasks. You also record your mood at various points of the day and the app will recommend different activities accordingly.I was skeptical about this app because many others let you have this great experience for a day or two and then hide everything behind a paywall. The design is very simple and its easy to keep track of your goals and the things you’ve written down! Overall I’d say this is worth your time if you like self care but you want something manageable and free. My only critique is that while a lot of stuff is free, you still have to pay for the rest of the content. This would be up to the developers in the end but something that would make the app perfect is if there was one exercise from each category so that way we get a sample of the other content that’s offered.I'm not one to make 5 star reviews. I usually have some sort of problems with a product or app that would warrant a 4 star review at best, but Finch definitely deserves it. It genuinely helps me more than any app I've ever tried. I have ADHD, so it's impossible for me to form habits. This app makes it so that I can keep track of my goals throughout the day, and get rewarded for it. I've tried a lot of self help apps, and this one takes the cake by far. Not only does it help me complete tasks, but the requirements for completing them is super generous and doesn't make you feel bad when you have an off day. Plus, the oufits and items are super cute, and you grow attached to your Finch. I love Mikey, and my life is definitely better because of him.Absolutely amazing app. Super helpful with setting daily goals and gamifying it to make it fun and more motivating to get goals done. It is also filled with moments of kindness and compassion. I know it’s geared toward anxiety and depression, but I find it helpful with my chronic illness. It’s helped me become consistent in taking a med I’d often forget, to get back to doing regular walks, doing daily breathing exercises, doing treatments,  stretching sessions, and the list goes on. There’s a free version with some features available and I think that’s worth trying. But I love and frequently use the extra features that come with a paid subscription $40/year). Also, taking care of your cute little bird, allows for a little bit of inner child work if that’s something you’re into.i love this app so much. this year i had to take a break from going to therapy due to an overflowing schedule, and this app has been a life saver through that process. i just have a couple of suggestions that i think could make it better :) it would be super cool if finch had a more specific progress tracker, for instance a way to track how many days you have been self harm free, or a place to log meals throughout the day so that you can look back on your progress and be proud of yourself. <3 in addition, it would be awesome if there were more ways to earn stones, and if the goals were all measurable and easier to keep yourself accountable for. otherwise it is such an amazing app, thank you so much for making it. it has helped so many people  xxxMost mental health apps make you pay absurd prices for the bare minimum amount of care this one does have additional fees but this apps still very functional and you can still get many many benefits without needing to pay for them all. this app talked me through a hard time it’s very LGBTQ friendly has breathing techniques for panic attacks any kind of big anxiety and tools to help cope with depression. for the most part it’s a to- do app where it just helps organize your life and set goals to help you get better and feel better one of my favorite goals is just “get through the day” because sometimes that can be really hard and it’s nice to know that they understand that. but I would highly recommend this app!!I haven’t found any other app that works as good as this for me, the main reason it works for me is because it looks kind of like a game and it doesn’t seem so serious. I have been doing so much better with this app. It has breathing exercises, first aid, goals to help you get better, soundscapes to help you calm down, and writing prompts for many different things! You can decorate your finch’s room choose its pronouns, name your finch and use it with friends and see each others progress! (No you can’t see their writing prompts or goals you just see their progress) you can also dress up your finch and find out their personality and what they like as you adventure with them! It’s so cute and so helpful. I definitely recommendI’ve been using the Finch App for a couple months now, I’ve gotten tons of special chests and treasures for completing goals and daily tasks. I have over 20k gems and I’ve dressed my adorable finch, Elderwood, as a cute little farmer with a little plant on their head and a flower pot in their wing. It’s an amazing game / helpful day-to-day! I’m nineteen years old and it motivates me, especially on difficult days, to get up and go. Over time, I don’t use the app nearly as much, but I still check in everyday. It gives you that “taking care of someone or something else makes it easier to take care of your self” feeling. And to empower your finch, you have to complete your own daily tasks. I love it and will continue to use it until the end of time.I actually never knew that I had severe anxiety until I played this game, Finch. It was recommended by a friend of mine who deals with 𝗮𝗹𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 everything I am. Ever since I started playing this game/app I've been gaining confidence--even though I've had this game for only like, 1 hour! This is a truly amazing game, you can customize your finch, invite friends for 500 crystal stones (I think that’s what their name is), and most importantly, help you with your mental and physical health! My sister also has this app/game, but I refuse to ask her why because I don’t want to force her into telling me why. I never knew how much I was actually doing and what my goals were and this game helped me out. To whoever made this gams, thank you so much, may you have a great life!As someone who has gone to therapy and takes meds, this app is amazing! Such a thoughtful creation and the prompts used are wonderful. I put other peoples’ needs before my own, so seeing my little bird, Pip, and taking care of myself to meet her needs motivates me! You can customize your goals based on your needs or how much you are struggling, which is so important. There are so many apps that just feel like you need to meet certain goals to achieve what you want…this app can adjust to you, as an individual, which is so important to one who is struggling and feels like they are not “normal” right now. The “journeys” are great too! I just have so many nice things about this app, I should probably just create a presentation on it 😅Two of my close friends recommended this too me on the same day. They don’t know each other, and from that resounding of a yes, I had to try. And let me tell you, I LOVE IT! 

I have an incredibly hard time remembering to journal or even having motivation too, but my little finch needs to go on his adventure each day, so i’ll write everything down and send them off without a thought! I love being able to looks back on the week and even if I did it quickly it gives a great snapshot for how you felt in that moment. 

I recommend finch to anyone and think it’s an awesome app! I do wish there were more choices in daily goals for free members, but there’s so much content without a paywall it’s really a minor detail.I’ve been looking briefly for an app that will help me reach my goals and calm down, and I think I finally found it! This app has been a lifesaver. My favorite part of Finch is the breathing exercises, because my best friend just recently moved away and the breathing exercises on here have really helped me calm down. I love that you can get sponsored by a guardian, which means that someone pays for Finch Plus for people who cannot afford it, and I have to admit that when I got sponsored I felt like someone out there, a stranger, actually cared about me and helped me get through my hard times. I literally wish this didn’t happen, but sometimes I have trouble scrolling in different pages, like the inventory page. Overall, best. App. Ever.Omg you have no idea how much find has helped me I have anxiety and adhd and this app helps me to feel motivated all because I want to energize my little birb! You can also set your on goals! And Finch already comes with some goals if you don’t want to make your own! You can also have some of the finch goals and yours as well. And I have completed so many things. Finch also has breathing exercises, stretches, sounds to help you calm down,sleep,and relax And you can customize your baby birb! And it’s house. Your baby birb grows every time they go on an adventure! And always has something to say to you like what they saw or if they learned something new! And over all this app is amazing! I would 100% recommend this!💕Finch is a fantastic app. You hatch a finch that you can name whatever you want! I chose Lily, because I thought it was cute, and some other names are Daisy, Finchie, and Molly. You can add people that matter to you to your tree town, I added some of my cousins and family members, and you can reflect about them. There are ones like “What do you think (name) was like 10 years ago?” or “What do you think (name) respects about you?”. You can set goals for yourself like stop using social media after 6pm, brush your teeth, avoid heavy meals before bed, get outside once, and also wash face. I highly recommend buying Finch, and you should also get Finch plus! It makes you feel so good, I just bought it yesterday and it is probably my favorite app on my phone.I’ve struggled with many things such as setting goals for myself and making myself feel worse about not completing them or why I’m so disorganized. Finch has been a huge help and thus actually helped me emotionally and mentally. It’s such a positive reinforcement and I’m so thankful for the devs on making this app. I love my little bird and although it is a fictional being I feel as though I want my little bird to be proud of my growth. I can set my to do list for the upcoming days, I never miss a day without checking on my little birdie so it keeps me in check. Even with feeling down and depressed sometimes, I can track how often and what I can do to overdose little challenges at a time to improve myself. Great app guys!I love this app so much, there is so many things to do to improve your self care!

A little breakdown of everything you can do and what it is about:

Finch is an app where you can raise your own “birb” by keeping YOUR own mental and physical health up! Your birb can explore tons of places, and discover what it likes to eat, drink, and even the music it likes to listen to! Everyday, set yourself goals to do, in order to take care of your birb! There is so much more than goals on this app though. You can do morning stretches, wind down stretches and so many more! You can take quizzes on how you are feeling today and you can reflect on things you did! Don’t worry, your birb is always there to keep you company and give you the best quotes!This app has helped build soft goals and gamified self-care. If you are the type of person that tends to help others over yourself, this is the app for you. You take care of a sweet little bird you get to name and customize. The more irl task you complete and mark off the more the bird grows and gains points. You can invite friends and send them positive messages or affirmations to brighten their day. The little bird goes on adventures and you get to learn about it’s personality. If you are into cute things then it’s good for all ages.
*If you are a parent you could easily set this up for a child to establish good habits. Building journeys and goals is pretty simple. The only downside is that the monetization screen does pop up frequently on the free version.I've been using the app for a while now and it's helped me with so much. Even when I don't want to do self care things for me, I do it for my little birb because it makes them happy. They're so cute and I can dress them up and send vibes to my friends. I can set reminders and goals and it gives me a space to reflect on my day and to write what im grateful for. It has a little mood tracker and everything. The developers also update the app actively and they take into account suggestions from users for things to implement.

TLDR: It's an amazing and adorable app anyone can use. You get tons of features without having to pay and the developers listen to the community for suggestions and are consistently updating it.My sister turned me onto this app. Mind you, I’m pushing 30 and I’m sure this is probably intended for teens, but it’s honestly been a great place for me to do some mini journaling. I’ve tried to start physical and virtual journals before, but I can never stay consistent with it. Im motivated to check in every day so I can send my bird on adventures and watch its personality grow. I love earning rainbow stones to exchange them for wardrobe pieces and being able to list my goals for the day keeps me coming back and makes me feel accomplished. I’ve also gotten great use out of the soundscapes. Just an overall great app to check-in with if you feel you’re struggling with some depression or anxiety and need a low pressure way to release your thoughts and feelings.I’ve tried many journaling / self care apps since I started therapy. This one has been my favorite so far. I’ve really been into more minimalist journal apps, but this one is so functional it’s a 10/10 for me. The prompts you get throughout the day really help me think and reflect about what I can practice or do better on. I also love watching my finch grow and become stronger with me, as well as my friend’s. I recommended this app to all my friends and will be recommending it to my therapist to recommend it to her other patients. The lack of ads and the many different features are a huge plus of this app. Definitely thinking about getting the pro version, but I do like to write my own goals and reflections.This app is soooo good! I feel really motivated to complete my goals each day because I like seeing what adventure my bird (who I named Rice) goes on! It’s great that your bird can have any pronouns you like and you can develop their personality however you like! Seeing what Rice says after adventures just makes me smile which makes me come back every day! You can also dress up your bird which is really fun. There are so many features and things to do that I haven’t even explored them all yet. I think that motivating people to complete activities like in the app works so well. It’s hard to always rely on your own willpower and it’s great that this app understands that. And also this whole app was made by only two people! Good job to them! ^_^This app is amazing. It brings me joy and keeps me on track with my goals everyday. It makes me feel accomplished and motivated to work towards my goals. I need an external motivator and have struggled with ADD, anxiety, and depression for years. This app helps me practice self care and keep focused on what I want to achieve. I feel supported and appreciate the external motivator to keep me accountable. This helps me also evaluate how my mood has been and who lifts me up the most. I am so grateful to the developers of this app and hope that someday the cost pf plus may be lifted for the families that might really need the support. I have recommended this app to all my friends and feel like it is helping me be a kinder, more social and more responsible person. Thanks Finch! :)Literally I can’t even begin to tell you about Finch. First off let me preface this by saying taking care of virtual pets and friends has always been my thing. From the obvious Tomodachi pets, to even Pokémon, I love taking care of pets! Maybe it’s my want to be a father but taking care of my Finch has given me something to connect to whenever I’m feeling sad about something. YOU CAN DRESS THEM UP!!!! Recently I bought a little raccoon outfit for my finch Leonard, and they look so cute in it! Ah! Anyways download the game it really helps de stress! Especially with the breathing exercises and the goals throughout the day, not to mention the sense of purpose. Oop I just got a notification from Leonard so it’s my time to take care of them! Ttyl y’all! Enjoy!!!! :)I used to have deep deep depression. It really wasn’t good for my health, not to mention how many suicidal thoughts I had throughout my day. My family was having a big problem regarding my father, who we had to get a restraining order on at one point. But throughout, my mother was lucky enough to find this WONDERFUL app. As soon as I opened the app, I knew I was going to feel so much better. Now, I had something to look forward to at the beginning and end of the day. I soon felt so much better and am very motivated each morning after I write about my goals for the day, do some stretches, and energize my finch bird (pine) for the day so she can go on a adventure while I am at school. This app really DID SAVE MY LIFE and I am so so grateful for it. ❤️❤️I have a lot of struggles with remembering tasks as basic as eating and flossing. Finch gave me the tools to spend the past six months working from the most basic getting out of bed every day to now preparing for a new job, a PhD program, and a bright future. Finch has many programs that help me with everything from eating healthier to exercising and meditating every day. The design is simple and easy to use. I’ve even started a custom program to help me prepare my application to grad school with my own pacing and goals. I am slowly trying to convince everyone I know who struggles with ADHD or finding the motivation to do the thing that Finch will make their lives better. I am grateful to the Finch team for creating this tool.much like the others who have reviewed before me, i’ve fallen out of touch with myself and have been feeling very down again. this app is so cute and motivates me to write down how i’m feeling by giving me prompts and keeping track of trends in what i write so i can see what's going on in my mind all in one place. i've gotten my best friend and my boyfriend in on it too and they love it. the free version is amazing on its own but i’m probably going to pay for an annual subscription. if u have a finsta, u will Love this because it's a truly private experience that's also super cute and helps u manage ur self care and mental health goals without the grandiosity of instagram or other social media accounts. i can’t recommend it enoughThis app has really been helping me and my boyfriend. It’s very cute and I love how we’re able to be friends in the app, and that you can send them hugs or gratitude or whatnot. Its been awesome for a long distance relationship. It’s just such an encouraging motivator, and I love how you can set simple goals like “get out of bed” or “change clothes.” It’s just very helpful to keep going on those hard days. I also love the little encouraging notifications it gives throughout the day, and the check ins are helpful for analyzing how I’m feeling when I otherwise often don’t really think about it. I do wish that you could see your friends’ little finch homes in the app, or if you could trade items with your friends.I have tried numerous self care/journaling/planner apps and they’ve never worked well for me. But THIS IS THE ONE. I’ve spent most of this year in the hospital and it’s really easy to let go of your self care during those times, but finch has made a significant difference in my motivation, organization, optimism, and over all care for my mind and body. I’ve found it helpful for all types of goals, whether I need to get a lot of work done or just get through the day. Do yourself a favor and give it a download!

Some suggestions that I think might help make finch even better:
Custom messages to people in your tree town
More quizzes and deep dives! These have been some of the most helpful reflection tools for me. 
More response options to talk to your finch after their adventures

And my strongest recommendation:
A different way to view your past goals and reflections. I really appreciate the ability to look back at reflections from other days, but the current scrolling mechanic can be a real headache if you want to find something from more than a few days ago. 

Other than that, this is a fantastic app!I was invited by fellow therapists from work, and I love this app so much✨💜 for inclusivity, check-ins, gentle self care nudges and more :) I love that it doesn't ask for in-app purchases, and I feel good suggesting it to clients. Thank you! The *only* feedback I have had to do with the mom/dad goals. I work with kiddos in foster care or who have lost parents, and I'd love it if that goal could use ""caregiver"" as default and then when a user uses ""mom"" or ""dad"", then suggest the parent specific goals? That may be much more complicated than I'm thinking; it's just something I've noticed with other personalized goals, so I wanted to put my two cents in. I love my little finch, and have been using this app for myself for 53 days straight.   Thank you!I love this app with everything! I love my little finch and this app relieves my stress and keeps me occupied during the day. I love dressing up my little friend. But, I wish the plus was a one time payment. I know that it may be unreasonable, but me and all my friends would totally but it if it was. Idk but something about paying every year just stresses me out… I want this app for a long time and when my cool features go away and I have to pay again I’ll be sad 😞 Also did you remove the little stats right above all of the likes and dislikes?? I loved those!! Please add them back ☹️ (like how much love you gave your finch, the quizzes you took, and the number of goals you’ve done… maybe it’s a glitch?? Please help idk)I really love how easy this app makes it to track your mood and create a powerful, yet flexible mental health diary fun. My therapist recommended I write todo lists to help me manage anxiety and inattentive ADHD symptoms so I was very excited to see this functionality already built in the app. They even include “Set as top priority”, “Skip”, and “Remind me at <time>” options in case you don’t get to all of today’s tasks :)

I’m already feeling more optimistic and grounded after 2 weeks of using it daily. I like to set goals in the morning after I wake up and then open the app throughout the day as I complete them. This method ensures that I get ample opportunities to reflect and record my mood, motivation, and satisfaction levels.This game is so awesome and helpful. I can get organized with everything and all tasks I need to do to get ready for the day. You can customize your own tasks and affirmations to feel better and comfortable with your daily routine. I absolutely love how it has relaxing soundscapes, yoga and exercises, quizzes ect. so i can feel relaxed and refreshed. My favorite part is the pet. My pet is so cute and reminds me to complete my goals everyday. You can log on with friends and remind and motivate each other to become their best and organized self. Your friends have pets that can become friends with yours. You can send positive messages to your friends or family that are logged on Finch! Overall, Finch is the best to choose from.I’m a teenager struggling with depression and I’ve tried so many self care apps that don’t help and feel like a long to do list. A friend recommended Finch to me and it has truly helped me so much. It’s a great motivation to know I’m helping my bird, Pebbles! I would give this 10 stars if I could. I’m a very schedule oriented person, so having the option to set the next day’s goals is super helpful for me. I think even people who aren’t struggling with mental health issues should get this wonderful app. I also love how you can choose pet pronouns. Being a trans individual, it makes me super happy to see that you can use other pronouns for your bird besides he and she. I’m excited to keep using the app.

Thank you Finch Team! 
Connor and Pebbles~ 💖🐦I’ve tried other self-care apps but so far this is the only one I can stick with. It’s simple, it’s cute, and it works. Setting goals and reaching them helps your baby finch grow. I’m saving the 5th star until a few bugs work out, which I’m sure they will. Great FB group for support also. Love it.

UPDATE  I knew I would be updating to 5 stars because I love using this app so much, but I’m doing it now because I keep stumbling across delightful little surprises in it — day to day history, including all the questions, not just the answers! — and each one makes me love it more. Also, I got a super-nice reply to my first review, asking me to explain “bugs” so they can fix them and I guess such a nice app had to be made by nice people. Thanks.I dont review anything. (I usually don’t have the patience.) However, this app has to be an exception for me.
Finch has somehow made self care into something tangible for me. Even it’s free version offers loads of journal prompts, and also some attachment to your cute little Finch! It’s inclusive, thoughtful, and fun. I can’t wait to see how it keeps developing.
It’s user friendly, and almost feels like a game. Finch doesn’t punish you for any days or goals you miss for your day, and they also keep track of your check in’s!
With journaling physically, I would’ve maybe made it a week. I’ve been doing my Finch self care app for 32 days in a row. 
Thank you to the developers and everyone on the team!I never write reviews for apps but this one has changed my mindset and therefore my life. It is so cute and it helps with mental health, it’s amazing. Even when i’m having a bad day the “first aid” section is there to pick me up, and the “breath” section has already prevented a couple of panic attacks from happening. On the good days it is so nice to set goals and get to check them off to give my little birdy some more energy. I definitely think that even the free version is super helpful. I did end up spending some money to see what else I could get out of the app, and it is definitely worth it to me! Again this has helped a lot and I am so grateful to the creators, thank you for making everyday more bearable <3Finch is great! It’s a great way to make goals and follow/keep them. It also works without internet which is great. Plus the birds are so frickin cute! I do wish there was a way to keep your pet/bird’s age forever like you can do with the micro pets, but that’s really the only ‘criticism’ I have. I really so love how the developers send the good vibes to people who have the app. So shout out to the developers for that. I wouldn’t really take my review into to big of an account because I got the app more just for fun. But it helps with my anxiety a little bit and other mental obstacles for me. Nice job Finch team!
(It’s also just a great app to have even if you aren’t necessarily struggling. It still reassures you nicely and makes me feel happy)You get to choose what color you want your pet to be and name it! You can make as many goals as you would like and check them off once your done. You can set reminders and customize your goals to whenever you want to do them and check them off when your done. Your pet gets energy when you check a goal off and you get gems to buy things for your pet or it’s house. Your pet also goes on adventures and once it’s done with an adventure it shares a story with like how it discovered something new and you get to choose between 2 choices how you want to respond! It makes me so motivated to do things and even has exercises, reflections, and other mental health things. It’s really cute, GET THE APP!Typically, I have a hard time with motivation. I do things as needed but a lot gets pushed to the side due to lack of energy or want to finish things. However, this app is so perfectly designed that it helps encourage me to meet my goals and finish things that need to be finished. I’ve only been using it for about a week so far but I am thoroughly enjoying it. Along with motivating me to do things, it also offers things like grounding for anxiety or panic attacks, stretching as a mid-day break between tasks, and a plethora of other helpful things. I would highly suggest giving this app a try if you’re anything like me. I see a bright future for the devs and whoever decides to use this app! Very well done!Somehow it is much easier to take care of a digital little bird than it is to take care of myself. I find myself excited to do tasks knowing she’ll come home faster from her adventure. I’m unable to get the plus version due to financial reasons, but I am excited for when those reasons are solved. It’s really affordable!!

I am definitely a little upset at myself that it took this app to finally do the dishes, but at least they’re done! I struggle really hard with depression and executive dysfunction but this app has been a great help so far. 

I’m hoping with the plus version I can write my own little goals for myself so I can get motivation to do the things that I need to do.i can’t believe a cartoon bird on a journey has changed my life. well, peppa pig changed my life, so same thing? essentially, yes. really? no. my finch (soup) is so much more than an animated animal. i can’t imagine a day without soup. their cute little clothes get me through the hours, and soup arriving home offers me a surge of dopamine. and it’s not that i just want to complete my goals; i have to. can you even imagine leaving a bird inside all day with no exercise or fresh air? making a bird walk terribly long on your blame? fine, i’ll make my bed. i’ll put three items back in place. i’ll take a deep breath and appreciate the sensation. i love soup, and it’s infinitely better than pigs, although i may be biased because i’m a pescatarian.Not only does it 1 have adorable little birds but it 2 helps you set up goals which is really helpful for my mental health because like I literally can not get out of bed and when I see  Get out of bed 🛏️ I’m like 👍🏻 done done done especially because it’s like a game too because you can dress up your own finch give it it’s personality make friends and it basically feels like a game. Finch also includes some breathing strategies which I use often because I set it as a goal and to be honest this app is amazing 🤩 unlike other apps they are like oh you didn’t finish your goal lose points and then it makes you feel even horrible! I love this app and recommend to most people!I have tried quite a few apps that are for self-care, goals, etc. (I also don’t like using apps for a lot of things) but Finch is one that I have stuck with (and enjoy)! It’s backed by science and research, it’s easy and fun to use, accessible to anyone; the free version is very good and you can enter a monthly drawing to have a month of Finch Plus sponsored by someone (A.K.A. a Guardian). Finch motivates, educates, and helps you in ways that are very customizable, easy to understand, and uplifting. It also doesn’t spam you and doesn’t ask for access to your stuff or for personal info (besides your birthday and an email, which is reasonable). 
I absolutely love this app and highly recommend it to anyone!Simply put, I love this app and it’s very helpful. I use it everyday and recommend it to everyone. A suggestion I could make though is allowing the user to move goals up or down  on where it shows all the goals because some people like me like to have their goals in a nice order to where they can get stuff done on a numbered list. I know there is a feature that allows you to have a reminder about what time you want to do that goal, but I feel like that’s just a reminder and shouldn’t make it be somewhere else on the screen. So I think there should be a feature that allows the user to easily just move the goal where they like. Thank you!When I tell you this app is such a big help with my mental health and self care. I used to try to find apps that could fit into my interest , but fortunately I found this app! It set goals for myself! And I could make goals myself. It’s very organized and there’s sections you can choose! Like breathing to feel relaxed or if u need to rant there’s a ranting section on the med kit area. I absolutely love this app. It shows the birds growth. I see why people love this app because it’s not like a non fun app, it shows adventures, your own home for the bird, and finally gives you support. It gives you quotes if you like those or if you want to set goals you can! This app is the best. It changed my lifestyle to being lazy to productive.I've only had Finch for two days, and I already love it. From the cute little pet to the First Aid when I need it, this app comepletely warms my heart. My little finch, Mercury, always reassures me with his notifications. I love doing stretches, I'm proud when I achieve my goals, the breathing exercises help me a ton, and its all to help my little cute bird to grow up and explore the world. Even the small detail of adding multiple choice questions for every adventure he takes fills me with joy. This app has helped me to calm down countless times over only 2 DAYS! Please get this app if you're looking for a real self care and mental health app, you will NOT regret it. As a bird lover, this app is one of the best apps I've ever had. Thank you Finch ! :)I saw Finch advertised on Instagram. It didn’t take long for me to love this app enough to become a subscriber. I didn’t realize how much setting and completing the smallest of goals would help me on tough days. I especially love that on the toughest days, one of my goals can be “take a shower” or “get dressed.”

The best thing the developers did was to make sure you aren’t penalized if you miss a day or don’t meet all of your goals or whatever. You could be gone a month, and your happy little bird would be waiting to talk to you the next time you opened the app. No guilt trips. No losing health points. Nothing negative in this game.  

Bonus points to the developers for letting users choose their birds’ pronouns!I am OBSESSED with this app! It has made me appreciate the little things I do everyday to care for myself, including things like simply getting out of bed and brushing my teeth, which can be challenging if you are neurodivergent or have depression/anxiety. They also include more challenging goals like exercise. Something unique to this app that I have seen are the social goals like telling your dad you love him, reconnecting with an old friend, etc!

I love doing the self reflection and meditation exercises and collecting gems to spend on my finch’s home and outfits! I originally only planned on playing with this app during the duration of the free trial but I think I am actually going to subscribe because I love it so much. 🥰Finch is a great app to get you motivated and happy! Your little animal is so cute and adorable!! She/He will let you pick some goals and you get to try and challenge yourself to do all of them by the end of the day!! In the morning when you wake up, your goals are reset and ready for you again! Your finch will tell you things that give you confidence and make you feel super happy! You can buy the cutest clothes for her/him with some gem things! She/he will go on adventures and tell you the story of it! She will tell you what she/he likes and dislikes! I think this app is so cute and amazing! She/he takes care of you to make sure you do things that are important and easy! Download now!!!🫶🩷⭐️one of my close friends recommended this app to me after using it for a couple weeks. I have struggled with mental illness for my whole life and it has just gotten worse through the pandemic. I’ve been going to therapy, trying to better myself, but i feel like i’m still just not doing the little things that will help me to feel better. 

This app has changed that! i love the goals function that will reward you for doing things both big and small (as well as your own custom goals), i also love the journaling function!! i’ve never been good at keeping up with journaling but this has made it so much easier. 

The app is super user friendly and intuitive as well as absolutely adorable. I can’t wait to wake up every day and give my little friend the energy they need to explore! it feels like i’m doing things for someone else and not myself, which surprisingly helps out a lot. (side note, i always LOVE the inclusivity of the pronouns!!)

overall i’d give this app 10 stars if i could. thank you for creating this and helping so many people to live better day to day lives!Finch is a great way to help you achieve your goals, but don’t worry  you don’t have to pay its totally free. While you are on your journey finch, your little bird checks in on you to make you you are ok. You can also submit forms for finch to know how you feel. You get to pick what color you want your baby bird to be with a option from a light dark grey to a beautiful purple and lots more colors to pick from. Also will get to name your bird for example I named mine waffles. Finch makes it fun for you to achieve your goals by giving you rainbow stones which you can spend in the shop to decorate your bird, to make him look cute. If I were you I would get Finch and if you choose to, wish you the best luck xx.First of all its so cute and I’m happy it let me put special people in a tree for new goals and it has sounds for you to listen to and helps  you with stuff on your mind and also you can take quizzes for anxiety and depression  and also  sleep and it helps you find a helpline and if you don’t know what a helpline is it basically helps you talk to people and stuff like that but I haven’t gotten one because I’m  lazy but anyways what I’m sad about is that you have to pay and when i say pay I don’t mean you have to pay for quizzes or goals or anything its that it only has one week that you can use this app for free yes FOR FREE but anyways enough of that i think its a great app :]I have tried to use so many other apps for self help, and this one takes the cake. I love the way it’s set up, it’s cute, easy to navigate, and satisfying. I’ve added my family members to the tree and it’s so wonderful to have them over or visit them. You can all work on your goals together and build relationships. I don’t feel forced to work on my goals, it doesn’t feel like a to-do list necessarily which really helps. Especially with having ADHD, it can be hard to look at a list with so many things I have to do, yet this app doesn’t make me feel that way. I have improved my day to day life little by little, even if it’s just small things. Highly recommend!What a wonderful and fun self-care app. It’s perfect for all ages. Notification frequency is just right, not too much, yet enough to stay on track. Interacting with the little Finch is happiness inducing. It creates a welcome opportunity to reflect, capture gratitude, or review plans and goals. 

This app is completely ad free, and no personal information is captured. Support comes from paid subscribers who get a few more features, and from sponsors called “Guardians”.  The developers are very responsive to feedback and suggestions. Obviously what they say is true- they created this app as a way to help others - it isn’t a profit scheme.

Thank you to the Finch team for this great way to stay positive and appreciate all the good in life.I’ve always been struggling with mental health and motivation to do simple tasks. When a friend recommended me finch, I thought it was so stupid, but I gave it a try anyways. Now, when I wake up the first thing I do is go on Finch and do morning stretches while listening to rain soundscapes. After that I work on completing goals so my baby finch can grow up! 10/10 would recommend this. The game has you reflect and really gather your logs, and you can add your friends to your “tree town” once they get Finch too! (Don’t worry, they won’t see your logs) There’s a helpline option in case you really do need it. I find it amazing how much detail they put into a simple little Finch game. 1000% my favorite game!!I absolutely adore this app! I’ve been using it for a couple months now and it definitely has spiked my motivation. It helps you pick pre made goals or you can make your own! There’s so many features like being able to choose the finchies outfit, name and more! Unfortunately I have switched from Samsung to iPhone and I’m having trouble finding out how to contact customer service in order to get my yearly prime subscription back. Like I stated I just started using a couple months ago and would love to have my full unlocked version of the app. Anyway thank you to the creators of Finch it is definitely a phenomenal app and I can’t wait to see how much better it can get!Most self care apps annoy me because you have to pay money to use most of the features you really need. With Finch it feels awesome that I’m helping this little guy grow and learn and although it seems minor I think it’s SO cool that you can pick it’s pronouns. Though not all the reflections, goals, or exercises are unlocked for the free version, I haven’t really found myself needing those features enough to pay for them. I actually look forward to opening this app before bed and setting my intentions for the next day, reflecting on the day, and then sending my little guy on an adventure. It’s just a really awesome app and helpful for deeply reflecting and noticing thought patterns.Now I am not always the most consistent with using Finch, but it is the only app that I can use semi regularly. It never makes you feel bad for not touching the app in months. And as someone who has tried both free and paid versions of the app (thanks to their guardian program) it works even without paying. If you can pay for the plus version do it, it adds some extra support to your goals and extra customization, but if you can’t, don’t stress. Their first aid and sos tabs are always available. This is the first app that seems to put the well-being of the person over the money in the company’s pockets. Thank you Finch!I love this app. It motivates me to accomplish the goals and the journaling helps me organize my thoughts. The app shows you feedback on what weighed you down the past week and what lifted you up. I find that super helpful in finding what things in my life I should avoid. There are goals that the app suggests that I really find helpful in improving my lifestyle, for example my sleep routine. And you do all that I mentioned above while growing and taking care of a cute little bird. It’s been a great help to my mental health and I’m so happy I gave this app a try. I recommend it to anyone that is looking into improving their mental health, sleep schedule, physical health habits, or just wanting to start journaling.I truly didn't think this random app would be so instrumental in my healing. I’ve never been able to keep a routine, and while I’m still not perfect, I can always come back to this and remember the very specific things that I can do to help make a dark day a little better. The app is made with care and intention and it shows through in every step of the way. I have bipolar disorder comorbid adhd and this truly helps me balance habits with fun little goals (great for adhd) while also tracking my moods and giving me the motivation to want my little finch to do better than me. I love this app, I love the creators and I love the guardians. Thank you!When I first got this app I was in such a slump I was just not feeling like myself and my friend showed me this app and honestly it has changed my life for the better I have truly came to love my finch bird and I like the way the app gives you goals that fit your needs and what you’re comfortable with doing and you can change them as you grow it’s amazing and I recommend to anyone going through something or not to get this app even if you want it just to keep track of everything you’re doing in your day it’s so fun to edit the finches house and clothes and I love that the finch has its own interests and over all this app is amazing 10/10 get itI am going through it hardcore and having the little bird depending on you to meet small goals to be happy is such a gentle motivation to get you to do things. Simple goals like “wash your hands”, “get out of bed”, “literally survive the day”. They are so simple but it makes me feel like “oh wow, I did it”. It’s awesome to help you back up when you fall. I find myself thinking “I will drink this water because I can’t let coconut down”, or “I promised coconut I would wash my face today, I can’t lie to him”. Sometimes we get down and this app reminds you that it’s okay, and that you can get back up, even if you need a little help, and there’s nothing wrong with that.I’ve been using Finch for a month, and it has been so effective as a motivator and an impetus for self-care! Every day I make my to-do list, and as I am able to check the things off I feel rewarded by the game aspect of the app. It’s helping me develop healthy routines, and is great for overcoming overthinking. As far as I know this is a pretty new app, and I’m excited to see how it develops. Update: I have now been using the Finch app for several months, and it has completely changed how I structure my previously chaotic day. Now, instead of overthinking and (literally) panicking over what I need to do next, I just look at my daily goals list. This app is AMAZING and really does work for me.Finch is an amazing app! You can start so many journeys from self care, to better sleep, to just existing, and so many more! There are so many journeys you can follow and each one has various goals that help you accomplish your bigger wish. It can be drink a glass of water, talk to a friend you haven’t in a while, go outside. I don’t think there’s a max even with the free version. You can also invite friends to participate with you and your finches can go on adventures together! So much is available with the FREE version. I haven’t encountered any major blocks and I’ve been using this app for about three months. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this all to absolutely anyone and everyone!!! It’s super easy to use too!I really wish it was easier to copy and paste to do lists from Notes instead of having to rewrite them each day or be able to set a goal as recurring. I am mostly using this app to try to build new routines for 2022 and having to rewrite the goals each time gets annoying. I can copy from notes but it sets all the goals as one, and hitting return between each also doesn’t get it to split into different goals. This wouldn’t be a big deal if I could do it on a computer but on a phone it’s really annoying. I tried the Plus trial to see if that would help but it didn’t 
Otherwise it’s an absolutely great app! I love my bird and it is helping me to stay motivatedI never write reviews and this is my first time writing one. This app is extremely helpful for “self care” and keeping your mental health in check. It’s like therapy and fun at the same time! I love setting it as a widget and “checking in” with the app multiple times a day. The random quotes are really inspiring and the writing exercises/goals section is really productive from a mental health standpoint. I set goals for myself on the app everyday and am more likely to follow through with it cuz the app is so cute and fun to use! There is just so much the app has to offer, from breathing exercises to meditation, etc. definitely download! The creators of this app are definitely onto something special.This app has helped so much with some of the little things I have trouble with when I’m down and depressed. Can be customized to make and set your own goals, your little bird friend goes on adventures and come back to tell you about what they found. Completing your goals helps your friend. I think my favorite part of the app is everytime you open it up, you’re greater with a positive motivation quote. As a person with a mental health disability it is soooo helpful and definitely makes you smile, but more importantly it shows where you need work, and encourages you to do even the smallest tasks when you’re feeling low. I’d give it 10 stars if I could.I’ve never seen an app like this, it’s so creative and cute! I’ve been with finch for 5 days, but it’s really helped me manage my room, hygiene, and friendships. Before, I was really bummy and lazy, but finch is actually fun unlike those other kinds of apps that give you like just a reminder or something. As the owner of 2 conures, birds are also animals I deeply connect with. HAVING THIS ADORABLE LIL DUDE JUST POP UP IN MY NOTIFS EVERY HOUR LIKE “Cheep cheep, I love you! You’re doing great on your journey ❤️‍🩹🐧” MAKES ME GO FEREAL ITS LIKE SEROTONIN OVERLOAD! I just sit there looking at my goals, petting pengu (my finch) and doing the activities and I’m genuinely not bored at all! In short, finch is very creative and adorable and I love the concept and I thank the creators 😭My friend recommended this app to me and I can’t say anything but good things about it ! It’s super cute and makes it fun to fulfill your goals and get a sense of mindfulness. There’s only 1 bug I’ve seen so far and it’s when you play a sound for some time once it’s done you go back into the app and claim your energy but once you do if u close it the sound thing is still there. If you press play again you can claim the reward again. You can do this multiple times and it starts to get confusing and I won’t go away unless you go and press stop on your sounds. But other than that it’s super cute! Definitely one of my favorite self care apps I’ve seen so far !I love so many things about this app. 
1) The widget available to put on my home screen reminds me to use Finch throughout the day, helping me keep my thinking positive and better tracking my mood shifts throughout the day.
2) You have OPTIONS but the format is not overwhelming. You can take quizzes, write affirmations, practice mindful breathing, listen to calming sounds, reflect on feelings, goals, and achievements.
3) It automatically tags certain words so you can more easily and quickly find or read over your daily entries. An example would be words like: grief, joy, happy, appreciate, job, thoughts, etc. 
4) The little birdy that you nurture is such a good metaphor for your mental health and self-care. By doing the tasks in the app, you are improving your personal growth as well as the little birdy’s growth! Plus the little birdy learns lessons that can be applicable to us as well (exploring our differences, for example).
Okay, I could keep going but I think I’ve made my point. I can’t wait to upgrade to premium and see what other features this app has!If you struggle with self-care for any reason - depression, trauma, ADHD ect. - then I HIGHLY recommend this app. First off, the bird never dies or suffers in any way. If you miss a goal or don't energize, it simply doesn't grow. Second off, the app rewards you for doing various excercises and meeting your goals by making the bird grow, making the bird develop a personality, and giving you more of the app's currency. You can also earn a lot of currency without the paid version, which I like. The whole app is based on positive reenforcement, which has been proven to be an effective motivator. On top of all of that, the little animated bird is absolutely adorable!This game makes me do self care to earn points to grow my pet and buy clothing & furniture for it.  It’s fun and cute.  I set my own goals too.  Like say 3 gratitudes a day to my husband.  Or I add 3 things I want to do each day that make me happy. Then as I do my goals along with the set goals I have to pick from, I earn rainbow stones.  The more positive goals I have and do, the more I can shop.  The longer I type in my goal reflections and how it makes me feel and what’s lifting me up morning, afternoon and evening, the more points I gain.  I can see this is a great tool to have me thinking and showing up positive!  Genius!  It’s fun to change for the better with this app.With most mental health apps, it only asks “hey what did you do today?” and I am not the greatest when it comes to non-interactive and supportive community type apps. Finch breaks that barrier- it helps add local friends and grow a friendship with your bird. And it not only shows the bird’s progress, but my own progress as a person while also showing support for other people’s mental health. And the goals part of Finch is my ABSOLUTE favorite. Because there are days where I don’t feel like trying, and me just filling out those goals makes me feel accomplished. I never been so excited to work on my mental health more than I’ve been with Finch. Thank you guys for making this app. <3I love this app. The idea of motivating self-care by doubling it as care for a little pet is genius for people like me, who struggle to see the worth in looking after ourselves. The art is cute, the goals are mini-challenges, but more than doable, and the sheer variety and expanse of features available are wonderful. 
I have only one request: if the developers could add a gifting mechanic, that would be fantastic. Being able to send your little bird out to visit your friends is great, but I think we could expand on that and allow our birds to take our friends items we bought for them, too. 
Other than that, this service is perfect. Keep up the good work.I have ADHD and anxiety and this app what’s really helped me during a difficult period for my mental health, and also has helped me build good habits. 

I find the Journeys function, which allows repeating goals for building routines, basically revolutionary in maintaining self care, hygiene, sleep routines and other habits with my ADHD. The little confetti and knowledge my completed goals help my little Peewii helps me with motivation and feeling accomplished. I feel like I’m working with my brain instead of against it. 

For my anxiety, knowing that my goals are checked off, “closing the tab” on them has really helped me, and the “first aid” tab’s breathing and grounding exercises have been a lifesaver for anxiety and panic attacks.

 The tree town feature helps me stay in contact and award of my friends (who have the app), especially between my fellow adhders. 

I love that the finch never gets sick or anxious like in other self care apps, because that would often make my anxiety worse and make me avoiding of the app. With finch I know Peewii is always there to welcome me back, free of guilt, even if I miss a day.I named my bird puddles. Anyway, I honestly give this app a five. There are some extra bits that you can pay for, but I didn’t and honestly it’s great either way. It’s helped a lot with my mental health and can help you set goals with it. I used not be able to do things like reflect or keep consecutive goals, but this app helps you do it in a fun way and lets you take small steps, especially as your penguin guy grows up. Puddles has been great to me and even helped me actually grow habits. I don’t feel stressed out doing this, because it just feels like someone asking about your day. Puddles may just be an app, but it will help you a lot as your pet, like Puddles, grows up and you grow mentally with your pet.Before I start this I just want to say over all this is an amazing app. It has helped me so much and helps me calm down! I have very high stress and lots of panic attacks so I really needed a way to calm down. The breathing exercises are so helpful. It's really what you should download if you struggle with anxiety, depression, or really anything. It happen me stay organized with the goals and helps me throughout the day.   Typically I don't do the in app purchases but I am considering these. And that's saying how good it is. When I first got it, it was a little glitchy but I think it was my phone and not the app because it works fine now. But overall great app. Definitely should get!Normally these little self help apps get lost and unresponded to. But this little bird is too cute I don't want to disappoint her (not that there’s any negative repercussions to not finishing your tasks or goals) I also like how theres a paid version, but you dont feel line you NEED it to get use out of the app. Plus you can actually become a “guardian” and gift those who cant afford the membership a month member ship. The tasks and goals can be set for anything. And it allows you to write little reflections on said goals. The app detects certain positive words and negative words and will give you a summary with how many highs and lows you had in the week and its really helpful.I seriously never write reviews but this was necessary. I have been using this app for months now & it has seriously become a part of my daily routine. I have watched the app transform in the matter of a few months and it just continues to get better & better. You can tell the creators really CARE & they should be very proud of what they do. Ive always had a hard time with journaling but just being able to jot down the positives & lows of my day on here has been so helpful for me processing emotions. I love getting to dress my finch & decorate their little nest. The seasonal items are so fun as well & motivate me to complete my goals. Seriously, an incredible app. Could not recommend enough.Wow, this app has literally changed my life and it has only been two days. It does have a plus version, (that you have to pay for so I don’t have) but even without it the app is awesome! It allows you to set goals and to-dos, track them, and record how you are feeling. There is inspirational quotes and messages that are very empowering. It’s very nice and easy going. There is no ads and you really feel better about a lot of things. It also has breathing exercises and other exercise that you can do. If you need some organization and order, or just an app that motivates you and keeps you going, I would definitely reccomend this. I recommend it to everyone!The app helps SOO much with creating good habits, and when you don’t finish your goals for the day, it doesn’t like remind you of it, it just starts the new day. All the goals are really nice too bc they range from like doing a full on exercise too standing up for ten seconds, and It makes you feel equally as accomplished for doing either! Nothing is based on weight or gender or any of that stuff that could just make you feel worse, all it does is make you feel good. Also, you have a little best friend by your side for the whole thing :) literally I’ve never liked any other self care apps other than this one, please PLEASE get it your going to love itFinch. Is. So. Cute. No, I’m not a paid reviewer or anything, but as someone who has worked with app design, it’s pretty darn well done, and it honestly brings me so much peace and smiles throughout the day. The uplifting messages are so pure! I love the fact that you can add friends, even ones who don’t have the app, to keep things organized, and that there’s no pressure/shame/reminders involved if you don’t get around to completing your goals for the day. Also great for anxiety breathing exercises and just so positively impactful! I honestly think every single person should download it, just for the happy little bird head tilts (you’ll see what I mean) if nothing else.I have literally only had this app for one full day and my entire outlook on life has changed! Being able to quickly reflect on events that have just happened and do breathing exercises to help calm me down has been absolutely amazing! Plus I get a little buddy along the way to help me! I have severe ADHD so remembering to do simple tasks like brushing my teeth and chores is difficult, with this app I’m able to set them as goals so that my little birdie can have more energy! It acts as a reminder and motivation! I’m going to continue to use the app for a few weeks before I get the premium version but so far it’s definitely looking like I will stick with this!This little pet app helps me so much… from reminders for schedules and tasks, to reminders for self care and compassion for others! It helps me keep a positive attitude about accomplishing goals and never berates for falling short of self expectations. It literally retrains my mind to be self soothing and not self depreciating. It combats the voices from the past that ring in my head negative self imagery. I’m so grateful I found this app! Now I realize I wouldn’t tell myself anything I wouldn’t say aloud to my little pet friend. 💞👏🏻 Thank you Devs for a good way to apply my CBT & PTSD tools and track how I’m really doing. Other users take note, it only works if you’re honest with yourself! Agape and phileo 🌺I have a literally never written a review for an app in my entire life, but this deserves one. I have always hated journaling and checking in with myself and just overall taking care of myself but this app has changed the game for me. I’ve been in therapy for a while and it’s really hard for me to sit down and reflect because it feels like homework.I don’t know what it is but something about this app just makes me want to use it all the time. I told my therapist about this app and she helps me come up with goals to give myself and we look at it together every week. It’s easy to keep track of things. I could go on and on, I have nothing bad to say!I absolutely love this app. Like everyone is saying it has been so so helpful for forming healthy habits and I especially like using it for journaling. The one thing I think would be awesome is if you were able to complete your goals in a more direct way. When you press the “complete” button for a goal, it just adds gems, but what if it took you to an activity within the app? Like the “affirmation of the day” goal - hitting complete would take you to the screen where you can type up your affirmation right there. Then you would get the gems! I hope that made sense but I am amazed with how helpful this app has been. So thank you!!I saw a tiktok of a girl using this app and I thought it would maybe help me with trying to be better about myself and my environment, but I had no idea I was going to love it as much as I do. I look forward to seeing my little Clover (my finch) every morning and getting her on her adventure by setting goals for myself and journaling and even doing breathing exercises and more. I love that I can dress Clover, I even change her into pajamas when it’s night time! I highly recommend downloading and it’s 100% worth the few dollars you spend each month for everything extra! Thank you to the creators for making such a wonderful tool for me and my boyfriend!I downloaded this app because I’ve been wanting a self care app that lets you take care of a pet for years now. I love being able to journal and set goals for the day. I also like seeing how specific things might affect my mood. 
Working with my little Lottie through all her adventures makes me so happy, and her little messages always brighten my day. 
The anxiety breathing exercise is an absolute lifesaver. I use it all the time. I was so thankful to discover it, as the app I used to use to breathe through my anxiety went behind a paywall. 
I’m so thankful for all of the free features that this app has, and I would definitely consider a subscription when I can afford it!I rarely leave reviews but I had to on this one. I’ve tried several apps that are similar to this one and Finch is hands down the best. I love the way it motivates you by making it fun and enjoyable. In the past, especially on my bad days,  I’ve never wanted to get on an app and even press the sad face much less anything else, like journaling. On Finch I look forward to getting on the app to record how my day is going, my mood, and working through my daily goals. It puts me in a better mindset no matter what I’m going through which makes it easier to reflect on everything and be more productive. Absolutely love this app!!The app is really helpful by helping setting up goals motivating you finding nice friends and so much more and I love that it shows your emotions for the weeks, days, months thing plus it has some breathing exercises which I find really helpful too because I have anger issues and really bad anxiety. I  am so glad I found an app that actually works all the other apps cost money and they make me feel worse because it’s like reminding me that I didn’t finish a goal. It includes a present everyday for gems to buy more clothes to make your flinch adorable. I love this app and I hope other people can rate a 5/5 stars in this appI would recommed this app for everyone even if there not in a situation where they need this alot but its good to have this on hand just in case this app helps with panic attacks calms yourself and even gives you a help line if you need one and it helps with anxiety and its a perfect cover up if ypur embarressed by any of those thins and its a very motivating app because it makes me happy to do all of this stuff to let my chick grow and exsplore and you can step goals and reminders for the day to complete and you can set a time for a notifcatiob to pop up for your finch to remind you or tell you something i would really really recommed this app the rating is VERY true!My best friend told me about this app and I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it! I get a cute finch I can customize and by completing my goals and sending her on journeys I have been able to help develop her personality and help myself along the way too. After using this app on a daily basis I’ve noticed my productivity has gone up and the way I structure my day too. I get more stuff done and remind myself to treat myself to some self care too. I love the soundscapes, they help me focus at work and on tasks at home. I can see myself using this app forever! A side note: I am on the free version and there is enough there to help me out and keep me entertained.Before I started using this app I wasn't really able to write down my feelings and express how I was feeling but my parents noticed that and show this app! I feel in love with it the second I got it, I mean the birds are so cute!

I was able to get the hand of things pretty easily when I started and there were so many things! I tried some breathing exercises which were able to calm me down. I used goals because it reminds me what I need to do that day like chores and stuff like that.

I also used a quiz to monitor my depression and it was hood because I was able to know I had it and get the help I need! I also around this time for Finch Plus which made my experience even better!

Your also able to customize your little friend and give them some really cute outfits! And you could also add friends snd family to your tree town and send them good vibes!

I would highly recommend this app for people who need a not complicated self care app! Or just even people who just need to do some mental exercises ever now and again!

Very Great App, I Love It!I’ve tried so many self care apps over the years, but there is something so different about this one. After just two days, I already feel a significant turn around in my life! The app is amazing! Below are a few ideas that I think would help make the app a bit more user friendly (if even possible):

- Have a dark mode option! This would be especially helpful when trying to do reflections or any sort of exercises before bed, because it would be gentler on the eyes!

- Including “add notes” options for goals! This would be great for writing tips, affirmations, or even reminders such as “plan to increase goal after making progress”. 

- An option that goals can be set for “once this week”, “once this month”, etc, for the sort of habits users want to build slowly, and maybe aren’t ready to add to a strict schedule yet!

- More pronoun options for out Finches! I think having a she/they, he/they, and customizable neopronoun option would feel so much more inclusive!

Thank you once again for this app! Have a lovely day :)To be honest, I only bought the full version *on accident*. I thought the app was offering me another free trial round and then I didn’t pay attention to the next few prompts and the next thing I know I had the $40 annual membership. 

But I don’t regret it at all. I’ve actually stuck with it for 80+ days now. I’ve been terrible with personal hygiene my whole life but I’m actually creating doable routines now. I am even adding more hygiene goals to my daily routine since I’ve been able to master the original ones set thanks to my Finch. 
I have a place to write out my thoughts where it feels like it’s being heard but not by anyone who makes me feel vulnerable. 
And the various breathing exercices are incredible for the different things they’re used for. 

Honestly, I don’t know how much of what I use is available for free or not but I still find the app well worth it. 

ANNNNNNDD the creators being so involved in their FB group and in making changes for the better and listening to their users also makes it well worth it. 

Do yourself a favor and adopt you a Finch 🥰Now, I’m not writing this because I’ll get rainbow stones or more points or praise or anything—but that would definitely be the case for other apps. But Finch isn’t like other apps!! It genuinely helps me set goals for myself, motivates and encourages me while I’m doing them, and when I accomplish my goals—it rewards me.  When I don’t, it doesn’t affect my little bird avatar or my self-care journey—because my own disappointment or having my other hard work made useless is discouraging and goes against Finch values. This app seems to care about you and your life…Whether or not you have a premium membership. I highly recommend Finch to anyone and everyone!I love the characters and the outfits. I love the wide selection of goals because I am very forgetful. There is also a family tree to help you bond with those around you. This app helps me get through my day with easy goals and makes me feel accomplished with harder goals and it lets you customize your goals and routine for the day. I highly recommend turning on ur notifications because if I didn’t I wouldn’t be on it as much because I am so forgetful. It also only sends 1 notification a day so it’s not annoyingly spamming you until you get on. I like that it gives you more points the more you reflect on your day, goals, and friendships.Only a couple days in, but really loving it. Any free app that goes this long without bugging you to download the premium version is promising. One reviewer here said it best—I think this app works especially well for people who are wired to take care of others before themselves. I find it hard to take time to reflect or breathe or set goals regularly—I’ll do it for a day or two and then give up. But having a cute animal character involved might really give this particular app some staying power. The exercises are brief and the questions are actually interesting to answer. The lack of preachiness in comparison to other self-care apps is also appreciated.Finch is a fun mental health app where you get to hatch a bird and raise it to adulthood by completing goals and activities. I’ve been loyal to this app for years after my cousin showed it to me. i’m not sure if she still uses it but at the time it definitely helped her. I watched her set new goals and achieve them. She also had several friends that found success through the app. I recommend it to my mother, and i saw so many improvements in her life. as well as my girlfriend, and at least 3 friends. Every single person listed struggle with at least one mental health condition such as: anxiety, depression, bipolar, bpd, adhd. This app is amazing because it’s not just helpful, it’s very fun !I don’t know what the labels are for my mental health things for sure - but I know I have time blindness and a tendency to dissociate (fairly positive I have adhd, too, but I’ve not been tested). I’ve always struggled with consistency - and when I make lists, which I love to do, I’ve always been way too good at ignoring the list. 😅 This app has given me a way to create potential goals that I can choose from at my own will and pace, feel good even about just completing a few, and gives me that good dopamine (is it that one or the other one?) hit when I do. Game-ify life, they said - and this app helps me succeed in just that. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. 💜This app is great if you put the effort in. I love how it asks my mood and customizes a prompt for me to write about. When I choose a friend face I get the option to rant and get extra energy for my finch the more words I write. It’s very encouraging and nice to have a place to vent without worrying what another person may think. A safe zone to vent about little things bothering you that day or big stuff you have no control over. There are also little quizzes to keep track of your day to day mood, and you get to set goals. It’s really great, especially because it’s free. I have recommended to my friends who have also struggled with mental health!I love this app so much. They've managed to utilize the crave for dopamine with self-care and healthy habits. Instead of turning to social media and video games, I feel motivated by accomplishing little tasks that I may not have done otherwise. Not only do I get excited when I can finally press goal 'complete' and see encouraging animations and sounds, but I feel better about myself at the end of the day.  

The goals are simple so I don't feel any pressure or reluctance to start. The animations are adorable. There's a ton of self-reflection writing prompts and breathing exercises. 

This app is doing an awesome job and I can't wait for more to be added! Definitely recommend.Finch has helped me with so many things. Getting things done, building good habits. If you want a reliable and honest review, here it is. So, what is Finch? Finch (which is a name of a bird, like seen in the app/app icon) is kind of like a goal-setter. You have goals for the day, you can create custom ones, and you can get them done. 

You earn energy for each goal completed, and goal reflection. A goal reflection is your self writing a reflection on what you just did. I recommend using this tool all the time because it has many benefits like the app analysing your mood throughout the day and letting out all your feelings.

You can also start journeys. There are all types of journeys for different things, I chose and am on building confidence and tidy space, tidy mind. This app really is just amazing.

It’s helped me feel better, and given me that self care I need. So please, download it would you? Aha. There’s way more stuff in this app other than what I have told you so far, discover that for yourself. I have something to say too.

Thank you, Finch.I am on the edge of purchasing the full version to see what else is offered because the free one has already been amazingly helpful the past week. I am able to feel accomplished for small goals. Diaries are overwhelming because I’m a perfectionist and get annoyed when I miss a day, but with the optional reflections on different topics to fill out, it compiles a list diary of sorts that is helpful. I encourage trying the free version before deciding to buy the full one. I have paid up front for plenty of motivation apps like this that just didn’t work for me, but now that I found one that works, I feel confident in the purchase.I am a mentally stable human. I am optimistic, I have little stress, and no depression. Finch still helps me. There is something on this app that can help YOU! I need help with organization, motivation to do boring things, and friendships. This app helps me with all of those things by giving communication with my friends. Also, I get motivation to do hard things because I get a small reward after. I can use these things to get cool costumes for my birb. I also get organized by having goals. I forget easily, so this helps me because it’s always here in Finch. Please try this app out, you will not regret it. Plus, if you don’t like it no worries! Have a fantastic day!Even though I’ve used this app for a few days I can already tell that this app will help me a lot in the long run! I love that you get to write down your thoughts and that you can get rewarded for doing goals as small as brushing your hair! The goals range from workouts to meditation, as well as being able to make your own goals. The app truly makes you feel better about yourself! I like that it also encourages you to let your family and friends be in your journey of self-love or whatever you may be working on! I would definitely recommend it to teenagers who have trouble expressing their feelings to adults or anyone in general.So many habit tracking apps only give you a tiny amount to work with unless you upgrade.  Finch offers so much more for no cost. Yes, there are perks to being Finch Plus but they are just that perks. For no cost, there are unlimited goals, freedom to write your own goals, and more. I like that there isnt a way to buy rainbow stones. They are available to everyone the same way. Self care by completing goals, starting and maintaining journeys, and journaling. I enjoy sending good vibes to friends and family who are tree neighbors. Also, looking at announcements on Discord over the past few months, the speed of improvements is brisk. Thank you, Finch team! Keep it up!I’ve only had this app for about three days, but I love it so much. I’ve been recommended  a different app by a therapist, but this one is far better. It gives you a lot of prompts to write about your day, and it’s very helpful. Sometimes I come home feeling awful, but after being asked to write everything good that happened that day, I don’t feel so bad anymore. I love that I can set goals for myself each day, and I love the social aspects of this app as well. You can invite friends to your adorable tree town, and send them virtual hugs! I cannot recommend this app enough. If you struggle with mentor health, and even if you don’t, everyone needs to try it.I used this app over the summer and oh my gosh.. I love this app! It has helped me so much with my mental health, being productive, and it’s even helped me get closer with friends and family. This app is also so creative and helpful with people like me who’ve struggled with doing simple tasks like showering, eating a snack, or cleaning up. It’s very fun and you get to watch your birb grow as you complete goals! It’s overall so amazing and so are the app creators. I would very much recommend this app to anyone who is struggling since it’s a very good app for self care, mental health issues, or even both! It’s very fun and you get to watch your birb grow as you complete goals.i feel like this app stands out from other wellness apps in that it not only encompasses many types of self care - you can personalize it for small daily maintenance tasks/mental health care to general goals - but it also feels very genuine in its mission compared to other apps ive used. i think the developers were really thoughtful in what “self care” means and how many forms it can take, it offers a load of content that is helpful for anyone at any point in their journey, not to mention its also VERY cute, i love my finch and i promise they’ll motivate you. really, really love everything about it and i found it seriously works. 👏👏Honestly I was a little skeptical about the about because I have tried many things to help me open up. However the little penguin is so cute and I want to see how much it grows I’ll sit on my phone and actually do the tasks asked of me, out of the other apps I’ve tried this is so far the best one I have come across and I’m saying that from finding a good app for the past 5 years. 💀 I’m grateful that I have came across this app, I am able to track my days and see my progress and actually do the goals I set. I know once my son grows a little more I’ll suggest this app to him so he can experience they joy I have gained from this app myself.To be honest when I first downloaded this app I thought it was going to make me pay for the full experience but it didn’t. I love this app because I can set up goals for the next day to do and give my little bird energy, it also motivates me to do more things. I think this app is pretty cool because for it doesn’t bug you to purchase the Finch plus and there are no ads whatsoever. I like the morning stretches and I love journaling my thoughts. I also like how almost everytime you open the app there’s a motivational quote and you are asked how you are feeling. Overall I am having a 11/10 experience with the app plus the bird is so cute when “it’s pumped”.We are totally opposed to subscriptions and almost never do it unless some app is best thing ever and we use all the time. This our most used app, ever! We love our Finch so much and it has helped us more than anything. So we subscribed but you do not have to, to get tons of value from it. When subscribed was hard for me but wanted to Support An App We so believe in. We would encourage anyone to try this that is looking for emotional help. This is also a great way to journal and set goals with reminders. Whenever think know all about the app We learn more. Just look at the reviews and help yourself and if can, help others. So grateful for my Finch! ❤️❤️❤️I downloaded this app when I was in a dark headspace a few days ago and this app has honestly helped me out of it. I’ve been using it several times a day to reflect, check off goals, and check in with my cute little companion. This app makes me feel so much less anxious and there are so many fun features that comes with it. I usually turn off notifications for apps but I’ve kept this one’s turned on because somehow it makes me feel less alone in the world. It’s like I have a virtual friend to help me get through the day. It’s like therapy for people who don’t have the access to therapy!As someone struggling with borderline personality disorder and anxiety , this app is seriously fantastic. The concept is absolutely superior . It has many different coping skills . For example: grounding with five senses, 3by3 rule , journaling(reflections) , breathing exercises , yoga, and etc . I have struggled for years trying to find something that works really 
well and is convenient . I have Finch Plus , but even without it, it’s seriously life changing. Being able to set daily goals and work on my mental health while taking care of My finch (harlie) is the best feeling. I love this app w my whole heart and soul , and would recommend to absolutely anyone and everyone.This app is so cute and awesome the fint hes are adorable and they can even have their own personalitys!! Ive been using this app for a year or so ish and its so great ive found myself doing the things i put as goals as a normal thing every day! it's helped me 
be more productive and organized in my day to day life! and i have ADHD and this can really help me get things done with a motive!! im so happy when i check on my finch every day and colect my gift every day dress up my finch and even design their room! ive never found a game like this and ive just reached my day 200 on this app and im so proud!! thank u finch team!! your the best! love yall and be sure to download it straight away!!💕💕💕Hello! I wanted to leave a review because this app has been such an amazing resource for my mental health. My Wilbur helps me build healthier schedules, keep cleaner, build my confidence, and be a better person to myself and others. I’ve only been using this app for a little bit, but I routinely check in every day to send Wilbur on adventures and complete my goals. My only issue is that I wish more things came with the free version, but I can’t really complain; they already give you so much with zero cost. All in all, this app is amazing, and I really thank the developers for helping me so much. 

With so much love,
                                  Leo and Wilbur <3I’ve tried many different techniques and apps for getting into better habits, bettering myself, journaling, etc. but nothing has been more effective than Finch! The way the goals are set up makes sense, and makes me feel accomplished for every step of the way. I am able to remember to call and check on a family member every Wednesday, to do morning yoga and affirmations, which days to do my chores and feed my lizards, all because of Finch. It makes it easy to get into good habits, and is fun to share with friends. I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone struggling with schedules, feeling accomplished, or getting into good habits. <3 Finch!!!I was skeptical about a gamified mental health and self-care app but I really love it so far. The goals are especially useful as a to do list for the day and the interface makes completing them fun. There are a few little bugs but the developers are providing a wonderful service in this app and they are improving it often. I don't use a lot of it (writing, the social aspect, etc.) but the daily goals you can write yourself and categorize are extremely helpful for just getting through basic life tasks each day. Unlike most apps the interface doesn't get in my way of using the parts I want and ignoring the rest.As soon as I am able to, I’m definitely subscribing to the full version. The panic breath work has been the only thing that helps me stop panic attacks. Being able to journal and reflect helps me process. The goals help motivate me to take care of myself when it feels too difficult to do so. My little bird is so sweet and while I know it’s just an app, I feel like I’ve built a bond with her and it now feels like a safe place I can go. This app has helped me improve my mental health in immeasurable ways and I am so grateful it exists. 5 stars doesn’t do it justice. Thank you, Finch team!!! I cannot recommend this app enough.Just download the app and check it out yourself, but if you want the feedback, here it is:

This app is amazing and by far the best app I’ve had. There’s no stressful adds, and they don’t constantly try to sell you things. There is a premium option if someone wants to support Finch with unlocked tasks, quizzes, sound time, and stretch time. If you can’t support or don’t want to, it’s alright and the app is accessible. Without the premium membership you can do fine, and still is beneficial. 
This app is where your Finch friend and you get to grow mentally and emotionally. You can add fitness goals, and the offer stretching tutorials. Your Finch friend can meet other finches and you can meet other people. 
You don’t message those people word like, but you can send others simple things like water breaks, gratitude, to be calm, and thoughts. 
This is a Journaling app, and can even work for people who don’t like journaling. Journalist or not, you’ll be willingly be writing.  You don’t have to write though.
DOWNLOAD your new FINCH!So I started using this App and I’m not going to lie, I kind of love it.  Everyone in the family knows I have to take time to care for my girl, named Wren, and I enjoy the ease of creating self help goals and the rewards for reflecting on different days etc.  It’s cute and a little silly maybe but it’s kept track of habits I want to build and evidently I pay more attention to them with a cute little fluffier poppet to remind me and focus me. I’m just using the free part and admittedly this is beneficial because of my whimsical personality and that may not work for everyone but I think it’s great for people who like plushies or childlike things like that.I love Finch! I named mine Kiwi. I love when he goes on adventures and brings back something to share. It actually really makes me happy when this little virtual bird is excited about something.

I also like how you can pick goals from a list. Some are so simple and easy to accomplish. That can be really helpful when you’re already feeling stressed or anxious from the day. Being able to check off a simple goal like “brush your teeth” can make you feel like you accomplished something even though it’s something you do everyday. 

This app really makes me feel good about myself and really motivates me to have the best day I can have!Out of app after app, trying to find the perfect app to manage and maintain a decent tracking of my mental health, this one has to be the best. Looking after my little finch (named Opal), I realized something: as your little baby finch learns and grows, you learn and grow with him/her. I’ve learned that setting daily goals helps keep me on track for the day. I’ve learned that my motivation is better than I thought it was. And of course little Opal has learned that all bobs live in pineapples 😊. I look forward to all of Opals adventures to see what she learned during the day while I was completely my goals. 

Best app for maintaining and tracking mental health. Good job, team!I found this app a few months ago because I was looking for apps to help with ADHD management after being recently diagnosed. This app truly helps me set realistic goals and accomplish tasks that I normally struggle with due to my ADHD by adding in a reward factor. The reward of getting gems to purchase things for your finch is the little kick of dopamine I need to do things that are typically a struggle, like filing away a bill or making my bed. Also love how much of the app is accessible without needing a subscription and that there are no obnoxious ads even at the free tier. I’m so thankful I found Finch and I’ve been using it every single day!I didn’t think I’d love this app as much as I do. I was so scared that I would have to pay to be able to get anything out of it, and that’s simply not true. The pre-set goals are pretty good, and it’s a great tool for journaling under a set of prompts. It’s definitely possible to get so much out of the free version and customize your bird too!!! I would get the paid version if I felt financially stable enough, and I think the ability to set your own goals and support the app in general would be worth it. It’s absolutely adorable and has probably really helped my dental hygiene lol. I would totally recommend this app for people with depression and/or ADHD. :)Omggggg I love this at so much they support the lgbtq community mine is holding the pan flag and it warms my heart to see it and they have all the flags I get to choose my pronounce and all the and it just reminds you to do stuff and it doesn’t make you feel like you have to but it makes you want to do stuff that you need to do like you set goals and stuff I’m going almost 70 days strong yayyy I’m telling you 10/10 recommend if you have a hard time remembering to do stuff it reminds you to get in the at a couple of times a day not annoyingly but you can also turn the notifications off ok ok I’ll shut up now but pls download great app 💕💕💕💕💕💕Trust me you need this. Everybody can benefit from the self love this app teaches. Such a great app even the free version. You won’t be wasting your time! I use this app a minimum of morning and night and it’s really helped alleviate a lot of my anxiety and helped me meet goals and understanding my emotions and needs. I have  bipolar disorder type 2 and this app keeps track of everything you enter and you can look back on all of that which really is beneficial when you feel stuck in a rut so you can better understand yourself (and for me, my cycling.) thanks finch app 💖 I’ve told all my friends and support team about you!I love this app so much and within a day of getting it i made one of my best friends get it. This app is really helping me with my goals and the breathing and other calming exercises are very helpful. Also I love that you can see what you felt on previous days, which is a really good way to track my moods . The only criticism I have is that I wish the goals were all listed ( as i do not have premium ) because I think scrolling down a list of goals will definitely help me. I also would suggest more quizzes. Thank you for making this app, I really do think it will help a lot of people.This is the only app out there that I’ve found actually helpful when it comes to completing tasks or caring for myself. I love the fact that I can create my own goals and that my birb doesn’t make me feel guilty when I can’t get things done. There are fun rewards when I do get tasks done to energize my birb, like dressing them up in cute lil outfits or decorating their bird house. I do wish there were more flooring options that show up in the shop, because that’s the one thing in my house that I hate. Anyway, that’s insignificant compared to all the good finch has done me. Thank you for this awesome app!!This app keeps me motivated to do everything from brushing my teeth to making my bed to doing sit-ups. I named my finch waffles and she sends me little reminders that I can do it through the day. While I’m  working myself, waffles takes adventures throughout the day and discovers new things. He has discovered he likes cherrys and bread but HATES the song baby shark. If you do your goals than he comes back even faster which is another way I do my goals. There’s also breathing exercises and so much more. 10,000% recommend this app if ur struggling with doing even simple things because this app has definitely helped me through tough crap.This may be my first app review Honestly, but this app is well worth it! Taking care of Flooby (my birb) and watching him grow has in turn been taking care of me and I can see it’s benefits after about 25 days of use. It’s goal oriented and allows you to reflect on those goals and anything else that impacts your life so you can see trends and patterns in your emotional, mental, and physical well being. If you have to skip or miss a goal it also doesn’t make you “feel bad” about it, instead it uses positive reinforcement to make you WANT to achieve those goals so you can report back. All in all, GREAT appFinch is such a adorable and helpful app. I’ve been struggling with mental health issues, a.d.d at 10 years old. I’m 14 now and this app has made everything so much easier. It gives you goals to do every day to motivate yourself!
It also reminds you every day that you matter. It is such a safe place and you can right about all of your feelings and moods. You get a baby bird at the start and you name and color it whatever you want and you get to watch it grow up by the goals you do! I also love how different birds and animals visit your bird every once in a while and remind you why your important and loved. 💗💗Hi I have been struggling with my own mental health and just trying to figure out who I am or who I want to be and I got an ad for Finch the one day and I just that I’ll just download it and I’ve only had it for like three days now and I just feel so much more confident and it’s really helped me with my anxiety my depression and how I see myself as far as a body image it’s really fun to watch your Finch grow and I really love it and it just kind of makes you feel better about yourself and it gets you ready in the mornings and throughout the day because you can set goals that you want to finish and it gives your finch energy so that’s really cool too.I recently saw a tik tok about this app and decided to download it to see what it was about. I found that this app is so beautiful and amazing! I got my friends to get it too and we have our own little neighborhood where we greet each other. I also love how i can set goals for myself and get rewarded for checking them off! This app has really helped me get things done that I usually struggle with because of my mental health. But i love this game to much!! Even the free version has SO many options open, which I thought was amazing because a lot of mental health apps now tend to cost money to unlock a lot of things.Finch is a great app for me because it helps me focus on dedicate and it makes me eager to gain rainbow stones and wear cool outfits. I have so many friends on my tree and I like seeing them a lot. It makes be smile and I love when my birb comes back from an adventure and discovers something new! It awesome if you want o keep goals are let your thoughts stream out. Finch doesn’t take any of your information so it is a very safe app. Sometimes it can get a bit addicting but rarely. I definitely rate this app 5 starts because it has done so much for me like inspire to get more heathy! I love turning into a toddler then a child an so on! I definitely recommend finch to everyone!I’ve never written a review for an app before but this app is amazing. For once it’s a free self care app that is so helpful and understanding. I don’t know what I would do without this app, please never get rid of it because it has made my life so much better. It’s structured like a game where you earn gems which are the currency and then you can customize your finch in outfits of your choice. A great reward that motivates me to continue with my goals and self care. The weekly summaries are also incredibly helpful because they tell me the big picture about what actually makes me feel better. The perfect self care app!I rarely ever leave reviews, but upon me saying “I love him” (in reference to my Finch) after every reflection when he comes back from his adventures, I felt compelled to come share this with the world.

I have tried manually writing habits to track, other apps dedicated to maintaining habits, but this one takes the cake for me.

Cute, easy to use and understand. So so rewarding and motivating, and I do not feel bad when I haven’t reached my desired goal/completed a substantial amount of tasks. 

Little things like getting out of my house and making my bed had been hard recently as I have been in circumstances that have not been great for me mentally, but seeing things like “survive the day” pop up as suggested goals makes me feel seen (to say the very least)

Makes me appreciate the little things in life, and life in general a whole lot more. The motivational notifications I get throughout the day and constant reassurance is what really realllllly encouraged me to write this review.

Highly recommend. 👍🏼I struggle with routine and have a hard time with self care for a lot of reasons! I am neurodivergent and I have a chronic illness. This app is working for me so far!

I heard about this app from someone commenting on a targeted ad for a different self-care app that was too expensive 😅 I downloaded it because I’m working on a self-care handbook for students and want to have some app recommendations and I kind of fell in love! I like my little “birb” but I wonder if that’s too millennial-coded for Gen Z? 

I’ve enjoyed the social aspect of checking in and sending good vibes to my friends. I also like the sounds from petting my bird and tapping the micropet. Dressing my finch up and decorating their house is also very fun. 
I appreciate the mood check ins, the ability to do reflections, the “journeys” where goals can be related and automatically repeated. So far I’ve managed to keep track of brushing my teeth for a few days and it feels easier than trying to do it without the app.I’ve used this app for a couple of weeks now and I think it is a great thing for people suffering with different mental health issues such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. People can use this app to help relax their mind, unwind from the day, and make sure they are just taking care of themselves. It allows you to set goals for yourself and then sends friendly reminders throughout the day to make sure your goals get completed as well as positive affirmations that help keep you going. It is definitely a comforting app that goes out of its way to personally check on your mental health, which is so important.Honestly I was skeptical of this app, but I’ve been here for, a month now I think, and am still consistent- which is the most impressive part. Usually I grow bored and kind of begin to resent goals that are set for me, regardless of how basic they are, but I’m really enjoying sticking with this app so far. 
I paid for Plus because I’m a sucker for cute little decor things for my birb - and I am loving all the extra quizzes and goals but is definitely not necessary to feel like you are still getting use out of the app! The Facebook group is also very wholesome and helpful! 
10/10 would reccomend!Would give it more than 5 stars if I could! I used to just keep running to-do lists in my notes app everyday but this is so much better. I don’t want to let my little finch down so it holds me accountable to complete my goals every day. I’ve had it for almost a year and I use it every single day. Thank you SO much to the creators. I even got a bunch of friends who also struggle to remember things they need to get done/struggle with procrastination to join too, and then we get to send each other cute messages!!!! I’ve never left a review for an app before but this one deserves it💞I really respect this app for what it is. I just downloaded it and am obsessed. It’s the cutest and most unique self care app I have ever tried to use. Super easy, no pressure for anything, they have tips and quizzes and so much more. I learned something last night I never even knew. They way they get you involved really helps change and boost your mood, get goals finished, etc etc. just if you’re looking for a sign here it is- at least give it an honest try, I promise you will like it. Unless you’re crazy and are against adorable penguins that grow into their own person off your interactions with them 😌This app is not only adorable but also easy to use, the everyday questions and the way it makes you reflect on your actions and goals for yourself is amazing! This app really changed that way I look on life!
This app is different from others, the other apps make you read Long Boring articles but this one asks how you are, and makes you feel comfortable but when your answering the questions you also get motivated and learn something! You also get to take care of an adorable owl and get to name it and make it your own! I think that app is an amazing idea I hope it continues to grow!I love this app so much! I got it recommended to me on another app so I took a chance and downloaded it, and I’m so glad I did. There are NO ADS (at least, I haven’t encountered one yet). Basically, you have a list of goals that you have to complete by the end of the day, and each of the goals helps you grow up your finch! It lets you name your finch, pick its color, and decide what gender it is. Your finch goes on adventures and discovers new things every day! You even get to buy clothes for it!! So cute! And there’s a bit of journaling involved, too. The app Finch is so adorable, and I would recommend it to anyone! 10/10! ⭐️I really like this app!! It actually works and is also pretty fun! I like that it gives you little inspiration notifications during the day! It has a lot of things you can do on the app so it’s not boring, also the goals are a fun way to to do your goals! I like that you can select how many goals you want and what goals you want. Also the adventures once you get so many of your goals is pretty fun and cute!! Because your bird can find new things that it dislikes and likes!I just overall really enjoy this app!! I have it as a widget and it’s pretty cool! Hope everyone enjoys this app as much as I do!I started this app with the free trial at the beginning of the year. It’s absolutely adorable and worth the annual fee. It gives you a way to achieve small positive daily goals that help you to just feel better in general. Some may see the goals as trivial but they’re actually very helpful and what you should be doing everyday anyway to help eliminate daily stress. I now get a cute positive little buddy that I can dress up and decorate a cute home for while doing daily breathing exercises or meditations. It also feels like a way to keep a nifty daily journal to reflect back on and guide you through the dark and light of life.This is the best free mental health i have tried and it's the only one i've been able to stick to. Here are the reasons of why you should download this app.

•Super cute, you get a pet finch that is so adorable and you can customize it in so many ways.

• it's free. You can get a finch plus version that cost money, but even without the subscription it's an amazing app.

•it's motivating. Idk why i'm so motivated. with other apps i've tried, i've kinda just forgotten. But for some reason i always remember to check finch for my goals.

•it has great tools for managing your anxiety and is had helped me a lot during an anxiety attack. 

•it feels great to reflect on thing and journal your feelings.

•Lgbtq+ friendly. There's a pride clothing section and you can choose from three different sets of pronouns for your finch. She/her they/them or he/him. I do wish there was a bit more variety in the flags and pronouns, but it's still pretty great they even have this available. 

100% would recommend downloading. 💛This helps me so much and not only is it motivating I love how you get to name your little penguin make friends or invite them send them encouragements or remindersIt’s honestly helped me so much you get to set daily goals you can see your well-being there’s some tests that you can do optionally there’s breathing work it’s just amazing I one hundred percent recommend it you won’t regret it there’s also offered to come by and every time you do something in check it off you get money and you can buy those outfits for your little penguin nobody asked for my penguins name is Pringle you should get this app have fun!!!!!i like actually cant think of anything to hate ab this app fr. its got some silly lil extra customization and other options for premium, but the basics of it are all free and im never like “ugh u NEED premium for this?” it doesnt guilt me when i dont check in for a while. sounds cheesy but this lil cartoon bird makes me feel loved sometimes when i feel like i cant trust anyone else. plus the graphics and goals and adventuring aspect keeps me checking in more frequently and motivates me to do so more than other apps like this!!! great for someone who had adhd (like me) or anyone who tends to be forgetful or unmotivated to journal n stuff. 100% reccomendim not sure how long ago it was that downloaded finch and im not sure why (probably a tiktok add or something like that) but i get ads for it on tiktok and the ads are super accurate. and this app makes me so motivated and its just so much easier. i love how inexpensive finch plus is, and how you dont have to get it for this app to work. and it has no limits on how many goals you can make like some other apps. and you can still do various exercises, quizzes, and breathing techniques without finch plus which is so nice! because i downloaded ""done"" and it let me put 3 goals after that i had to get premium, why are apps so money hungry?! and i also love how they offer to let you pay how much u can afford! so if u arent doing well and u need to pay a little less u can but you can also pay normal amount and above and besides all of that i redownloaded this app so i could get back into my wellness and it reminded me how much i absolutely love it and my little baby pie is soo cute this app is amazingI downloaded Finch a couple of months ago, and I can see a major improvement in my mental health and the way I cope with things. I’ve been struggling with issues in my mental health since I was in 3rd grade, and it’s helped me tremendously. It has breathing exercises, reflections, and journeys you can go on that just add to the impact of the original goals. On top of that, I can look forward to whenever my finch goes on a journey because she always has something interesting to tell me when she gets back.

Finch is one of the best apps I’ve ever downloaded, and I can’t thank the team enough for making it.Finch has helped me with my mental health. Finch has breathing exercises for almost everything. Panic attacks, anxiety attacks, anxiety in general, and so much more. Finch gives you goals to complete in a day and the little bird is so cute. Also, you can just vent in finch all you want. You have several pages for your typing and you can just let it all out. The nice thing about that being on your phone verses a notebook is that normally people aren’t on your phone and you have it with you all the time. Where as a notebook people can easily read it and there goes all of your secrets. Finch is an amazing app and I recommend it.I love Finch! I was super pumped about the house update, bought a bunch of furniture, and then it updated and my house was gone along with all the stones I spent on it. Can I have those back? I’m fine with waiting for a finished product but it was like 2k rainbow stones 😭 with the exception of that, the game is great. No bugs, no ads, cute clothes, and I don’t get pesky reminders if I forget to send my Finch out for the day, just cute little notifs from the Finch itself! I recommend playing with someone for sure, sending my finch back and forth keeps me motivated to open the app and then in turn achieve my goals.i’ve been using this app for over a month and a half. i have anxiety and depression and that gets worse when i don't accomplish a strict regimen of things, especially in the summer. I downloaded finch and something about the goals, the adventures, the cute little pet.. ugh i love it so much. my bird aphrodite is officially a child! this app has become a part of my daily routine, i just sit down for five to ten minutes write out what i did that day and it makes me so much more accomplished. totally recommend! five minutes of this adorable app a day will accomplish so much for your mental health. what is five hours of social media doing?This is the most helpful (and the cutest) self care app I’ve used. Writing down and keeping track of my thoughts and feelings throughout the day has helped me keep myself steady. I love the simple yet effective goals the app recommends. The in-app rewards you receive for completing the goals and other activities actually helps motivate me to do them.

As someone who has always loved virtual pet games, I love that taking care of myself helps take care of my bird too. I love that over time you can form its personality. And of course, buying new clothes for my bird is fun.

This is a great, positive app and I would highly recommend it!I saw this app advertised on FB and was skeptical but I’m kind of a sucker for anything with a virtual pet. I haven’t been doing great mentally anyways so I figured what’s the harm. If you’re trying to journal or set little goals for yourself this app is actually very resourceful. It does small check ins through out the day to see how you’re doing and if you would like to set up a goal or a reminder or just say how you’re feeling right now. As you do this you take care of your little finch baby bird (which you get to name!!!) so far have been using this app for 5 days and it’s very nice. I love the insights and reminders.This game is awesome! You can have healthy habits that this game can motivate you to keep doing. It makes you feel good when you can come back to a companion friend after you have complete all of your goals. I do notice some glitches. First of all, (I do this on an iPad) whenever I go into inventory to change my clothes I can’t scroll down. I am stuck on the view of my companion and his room. And secondly, for the dragon event going on I also cannot scroll down. I love this game, but if these glitches do not get fixed I don’t know if I can play it confidently.I’ve been using finch for a little over 100 days now, and it has genuinely changed my life. I struggle with depression and anxiety which makes even simple things difficult, but Finch is the perfect way to take things one day at a time. It’s extremely user friendly, never gilts you into motivation like other apps, and has a warm and comforting environment! It helps so much with self reflection and setting goals that I want to achieve. I love watching my little birb grow and having them as an accountability partner. I could not recommend this app more.
Finch is truly the best <3Motivating and helpful, Finch helps a disorganized person like me stay on track and get things done. Finch always helps me feel more confident with their reflections. A fun way to feel better, you can take care of your own finch—another motivation to keep going.
I have tried other apps with the same goals before, and Finch is definitely the best. And the biggest part—it’s completely free for use. You can upgrade, but you don’t have to make an account. Just enjoy Finch. 
This app is so well thought out and such a game changer if you’re considering getting this stop considering! Get it now!thank you for making an app out of care, and not just out of just financial gain there are a lot of people struggling with mental health. and an affect of mental illness is lack of motivation and many other things that really take a toll on your life. this app brings me joy, and i hope it never changes for the worst. if anything you can make the free version better but in my opinion im satisfied. I look forward to taking care of my finch and i hope you Never Change the free version. my only complaint is that I can't figure out how to make more permanent goals that come back every day. 
love you creators !I’ve been using this app for a couple of days now and it’s already my favorite app I’ve ever used for anything ever. It’s so adorable that I want to just sit on the app and complete tasks that are good for me so I can buy more accessories for my birb friend. I also love the feature where your friends can visit and send hugs. My long distance best friend got the app too and we’ve been sending hugs and good vibes back and forth ever since. It’s such a nice way to stay connected. I also love how customizable it is and extensive the goals that are on there already are. Such a good app and I can’t wait to see me and my baby Bagel grow!First of all, this app is just unbelievably cute. The little characters and the way you can interact with them are adorable and fun! More than that, though, this app is surprisingly insightful about and useful for mental health. The little goals you can set are not only proven methods for bettering your mental health, but they can help you feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day when you check them off. Also, the social tool is fantastic, since it gives a way for friends to gently support each other in ways that they might not normally. In all, I highly recommend this app!i’ve tried a lot of different apps and tools for my depression, and this is the only one that keeps things manageable and uplifting. it helps you keep track of what goals you miss most often, and offers insight instead of judgement. I found that a lot of other apps make you feel guilty or bad if you don’t meet your set goals, which is a disaster for someone living with depression. i love the journaling prompts and really all of the features. super helpful + an adorable user friendly interface. this app checks all the marks for me, and the paid version is definitely worth it.As an eating disorder therapist, this is the ONLY APP I can recommend safely to my clients. There is NO WEIGHT TALK, NO “HEALTHY EATING” TALK and the “first aid” goals are so soft and tender that they make it easy to get a “win” for the day. I appreciate that if prewritten goals aren’t applicable (for instance, my dad died years ago so the “call dad and tell him you love him” one isn’t great for me) you can delete them permanently.  I hope the developers keep this a weight loss and food talk free zone - both for myself and for my clients. I have used this app longer than any other self care one, and I will continue to both use it and recommend it.I love this app. It gives me reminders to do the things that I do in therapy. I really like the first aid section that pops up when your mood is low. I also appreciate the thoughtful goals we can add to our day like “literally survive”. The pet is really cute so it makes me want to interact with it more. I also like sending hugs and hello’s to friends that I may not have time to talk to all the time. 

❗️Request: I wish there was an easy way to save quotes to favorites. Since the favorite and mute are right next to each other I have accidentally muted a quote I liked and don’t know how to get it back.I have tried a lot of mood tracking apps, mindfulness apps, and goal setting apps, only to give up on them when I am not in a good place.

Finch has all of those abilities and takes a lot of the mental load off of you. It prompts you to track your feelings. You can write your own goals, but it also has basic, pre-made goals that you can select without thinking them up/typing them in. Sometimes if you are feeling low enough, typing ‘brush teeth’ feels like it’s too much. But choosing it and seeing it on my list gives me the motivation to actually brush my teeth. 

That is what sets the app apart for me from all other mental wellness apps - it seems acutely aware of how difficult it can be to wake up in the morning, and it encourages you to take baby steps and still feel proud. The Tree Town feature is another favorite for relationship building and maintenance when you fall out of touch with people.

And the bird is adorable, of course!I honestly struggle with being able to complete simple, i think i may have some mental problems, not that it’s your concern… this app is one of the only free apps that will allow you to track progress with moods and help you set goals for yourself. there’s a “first aid” section that shows breathing exercises and mental health quizzes. the more activities you complete the more stones your finch gets, this allows you to personalize him/her/them. if you have notifications on and aren’t on the app for a while you will get an “i care about you” “sometimes it’s okay to take breaks” “there’s always someone to talk to” etc. messagemy finch baby sprout is adorable and this app is amazing! i’ve tried other mental health apps and i always end up forgetting about them or deleting them but this one is the first that i’ve genuinely loved!! it’s so easy to do things on this app and i love to feel like i’m taking care of someone while taking care of myself!! the reflections are helpful in discussing my own emotions and i love the goals as they’ve pushed me to do things i usually would avoid or not be able to do!! this app is amazing for adhd because i’ll just see the widget and remember to check in on my finch and myself!! highly recommend!This app has helped me track my self care, slow down and ground myself in difficult situations, and has helped me show my friend and family I care just by a little action in-app. I’d recommend this app to anyone who wants more support in reaching goals, needs to track progress in spaces like therapy, and for those who just enjoy cute, gamified self care. The prompts for daily goals always help me expand my toolbox of necessary coping skills and strategies. The quizzes about my mental health and wellness help me reconnect with my brain and body over long periods of time. I HIGHLY recommend this app. One of the best things I’ve used for my life!I got this app thinking “maybe I’ll use it sometimes.” But then my finch hatched, I am completing my goals and reflections every day because I love him so much. I have noticed that I tend to be calmer each day after doing a certain reflection or quiz, this app rules. Not only does it supply you with a large collection of reflections, quizzes, calming sounds, and more, it also has a friendly quote every time you open the app. You can start a journey tailored to you to get the best self care you need, and sends a friendly message to you every day, personally from your bird 5/5 star app, GET IT.Finch is literally the best self-care/mental health app that I have used to date. It is anything but intimidating, like a lot of other apps, and it fosters your caring and compassionate personality by taking care of your pet (aka, taking care of you!)It reminds me about how we should never speak poorly of our childhood selves. Finch reminds me of my childhood self and just like the way I need to nurture and care for my pet, I need to nurture and care for all versions of myself.

The app makes setting goals easy (the goals can be as basic or complex as you want) and it actually makes me excited to check things off my list!I am blown away by how intuitive this app is. I love learning about my birb, Tuba and myself as the days pass by. I have set so many goals, all spread through out the year and I actually look forward to pressing complete. I have filled my Tree with friends and they are loving the app too. I also appreciate how all the resources for high anxiety and panic ridden situations are made available to everyone for free. Even the hotline number is included. I can’t wait to see what else they add to this app. It’s an added bonus that I can dress little Tuba up in cute outfits. Now I have to go find a cute outfit too!I’m only a few days into using Finch and I’m thankful a friend recommended it. It is a cute way to track goals and how all the little details of your day affect you. It is a quick easy way to journal events that make you happy or sad etc. It prompts you with easy to answer questions where you can put as much or as little detail as you feel at the moment. Sometimes just reflecting on your day or seeing how much you actually accomplished can change your outlook on your life. I highly recommend it. At the very least give it a shot and see what you think. 😊I go on adventures everyday, completed all of my goals everyday and I just love this app, but one little thing. The writing exercises (the reflections) are sometimes for adults. “Like reflect on a old memory from your childhood” it isn’t a really big deal but I thought maybe the developers could make like, a section that asks about your age and if you want things like that. Not a big deal, just a thought. I REALLY recommend this app to everyone, you don’t always have to be like, (no offense) in need of help, mentally. It is a really cute birb and I think everyone should have this.tl;dr — Great app for adults who’d like gentle reminders to check in with themselves and loved ones while also taking care of an adorable bird.

I enjoy opening this app every morning/night to log my goals and talk with my little finch, Opal. I’m an adult who’s actively working through mental and physical health struggles. Finch helps me stay grounded and acknowledge my accomplishments at my own pace. It doesn’t make me feel ashamed for missing a day, or only completing some of my goals.
 
Some of my favorite things about this app are: The adorable finch you get to name and watch grow, Tree Town (and the ability to add your friends as neighbors!), friends’ finches stopping by to say hi, the adorable items your finch can wear, and the variety of prompts you’re given.

The only negative experience I’ve had so far is the lag. No matter what, the animation and input always lags. On struggle days, this keeps me from interacting as much as I would like to. It’s not very noticeable, so I still believe it’s a 5-star app.I downloaded this app after seeing a TikTok about it. The TikTok creator gave the app a good review in their video and I wanted to give it a shot. The app reminds me to care for myself by enabling me to set realistic goals for the day. It even sends me reminders to accomplish said goals which has certainly improved my productivity. It also allows me to reflect on my day and my emotions. I am pleasantly surprised at how this app has helped me to improve both my physical and mental well-being. It does all this and more while letting me care for an adorable little bird! I absolutely love it! Would highly recommend!i have loved using this app! it’s been a really great tool to help me get things done throughout the day- especially when i’m struggling. it keeps me motivated to do things to help me take care of myself that help with my mental health a little bit everyday. i like the different personalizations offered so you can focus on specific goals. especially when it comes to stress. it helps me practice self awareness and mood monitoring by offering options to write about your day or what’s stressing you out. not only are you doing it to hold yourself accountable, but also for a virtual pet. the breathing exercises, which can help calm your nervous system. i learned in my abnormal psychology class about cognitive-behavioral factors as some of the etiology for disorders, like anxiety and while this app is not necessary the only way you can get cognitive-behavioral treatments, it’s an easy way to get started with doing some on your own with the mediations and mindfulness activities the app provides.I love this app! Taking care of the bird really helps me be motivated to take care of myself on my bad days. It also really helps with my perfectionism because the app doesn’t track if you haven’t done goals and doesn’t reward you for being perfect in doing all of them, just for doing anything. The amount it takes to send the bird on an adventure is manageable even for bad days, and if you record a rough mood, it will give you more points for completing goals, which really helps to motivate on bad days. It’s helped even out my self care even when I’m manic or depressive.Finch is such a great app. For a while I was lazy, and layer in bed A LOT because I wasn’t motivated to get up, see people, or even do the things I love. I love finch because not only do you feel proud when you complete goals, but your finch (the bird) gets new cloths, furniture, and color when you take care of yourself. It’s kind of like a video game we’re you have to complete fast to earn coins. But here, you need to meet you goals and get rewarded with different things. The app also has healthy coping methods for panic attacks and other stuff which I found pretty helpful.I have a hard time keeping track of what I do. I’ve used a plethora or both digital and physical ways, and none have solidly helped. Finch changed the game for me!

My friend mention it to me, saying that she thinks it would help me. Its nice to have a little friend to take care of, while taking care of yourself and moving through life. They’ll move with you! They take adventures and make discoveries.

You can connect with friends, and send them love and messages. You can also reflect on how you complete your goals, as well as there being entire selections of goals to help you spend some time with yourself! I really enjoy the reflecting feature, and you even gain points by writing more words!

You can decorate your finch and their room - they can even have a friend! Its a fun way to tackle to do lists, and is very sweet as well!

Thank you to the creators of this app!! I’ve heard its just a couple of friends, and I thank you!I’ve had this app for almost a year and i can’t tell you how much it’s helped my daily mindset. Depression can make it hard to do simple things like self hygiene and keeping up with homework. Finch motivates me to get into daily routines and isn’t judgmental when tasks don’t get completed. The app encourages you to take small steps towards your goals. Nothing feels overwhelming and since downloading, I’ve started meditating, I consistently remember to take my medicine, I have my daily morning and night routines, I reach out to friends and family, and so much more. I love my little finch 🐥Love, love, love this app. A friend recommended it to me. Who wouldn’t want a customizable mental health, wellness app that doesn’t guilt you for all the things you don’t do “right” in a day. Instead, positive reinforcement of little sustainable goals. Accompanied by an adorable virtual pet that reminds you of good things. And if you have finch neighbors, they will send their pets to check in on you to make sure you’re okay and remind you to drink water, send virtual hugs, etc. 

some highlights of pros:
-user friendly
-Goals are customizable
-Soundscapes and focus timers super helpful
-you can customize reminders for goals repeated daily, weekly, which days, what time to be reminded etc. making it super helpful
-in-app helpline, grounding and self-soothing techniques, quizzes on mental health to encourage speaking to a professional
-“rewards” for taking care of yourself (and your virtual pet) are easy to obtain, making you come back to complete larger goals

This app is a game changer!My sister tricked me into downloading this thinking it was a planner app and I’ve unknowingly become so enamoured with this app (and my bird). 
This app has surprisingly helped me take some time in my busy days to slow down and reflect on the things I accomplished and made me happy. I longed to see my bird happy as well, which made me want to take care of myself so I could complete the daily goals (the little bird noises are so freaking cute too, it never gets old).
The notifications always make me smile as well, so if your a sucker for cute animals, this app will definitely motivate you :).I have been using this app for the last couple days and I’m extremely impressed by the layout and how much this helps me! You can manage different goals, it has breathing exercises and so much more! It also has a cool feature where the chick goes on a walk and comes back with a gift for you. The more rainbows you get you can use those to buy items in the store. If you are overcoming anxiety, depression or even a lack of motivation please get this app and don’t hesitate! I love it so much. 
PS there is no annoying ads like there is in other applications to help with mental health. 
Enjoy!!!!This is such a great app! I use it every day. I love the prizes you get while completing goals. This app teaches you how to relax and relieve your stress. The cute little birds are so funny and kind and I love dressing mine up!

Here’s a suggestion: add a trading rainbow stones feature! I would love to be able to give my friend some rainbow stones when she needs them. 

Another suggestion is that you can feed your birb whatever they want! I’ve noticed that if you click under your birbs name it will say “____ munched on Apple” or something like that. It would be cool if you could decide what to feed them!I am a HUGE finch fan. Am I almost 30? Yes. Do I think it’s a little juvenile or silly? Yes. Do I care? NO because it being kind of silly is part of what makes it great! This app has made such a huge difference for me in difficult times— the goals you set for yourself are simple and I never ever feel pressured to complete them OR guilty for not. I just feel accomplished when I do, which is what it’s all about! Reminders are gentle and uplifting. Tracking my moods, goals, and etc. has been so interesting and helpful. I just can’t recommend Finch enough. I love being able to send good vibes to people too!The creators of this app really care, and obviously understand the struggles of someone dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. I am 64, and feel that people of any age will enjoy this app. The app is visually appealing, and new features are frequently added. The app, and my little bird, have helped me to get on track with achieving my goals, as well as get through the rough days. The paid version is well worth it. They have also recently started a program to help people get the paid version that cannot afford it. Many thanks to the developers and support team for Finch.Finch has majorly improved my mental health even in just my first week of usage. Sometimes I feel annoying always needing to lean on friends or family which makes me hesitate to ask for the support or listening ear I need. Finch has created a space for me to express as much and as often as I need. It’s the most gentle mental health app, I never feel penalized if I can’t reach all my daily goals. I suggest this app to anyone whether you suffer from major mental health issues or just the occasional blues. Thank you Finch team for how much good you’ve given me!!I just started using this app about a week ago and there is a noticeable improvement in my mood and attitude! Friends of mine have been asking why I’m so upbeat! This app provides information for mental health and ways to express feelings and emotions and ways to deal with them. It has excersises and reflections so you can really focus in on what matters in your life. You can set goals and start journeys with a set task to help you reach your long term goals by building up good habits! Overall love this app it is cute and nicely designed and is just an amazing way to get your mental health back on track!I love this app so much I bought the premium subscription. I’ve been pushing my friends to get it! I love being able to interact a little with my friends, but I’d love more of that! Let us visit each other’s houses! I work so hard on my house and want to go visit my friends. Let us send personalized messages to each other instead of just clicking high five and sending an automated message. It would mean so much more to see why they sent me a high five or love my outfit. And please more options for goals and activities! Oh, and I’d love to be able to gift items to my friends!i absolutely love finch!! i have struggled with anxiety and depression and was stuck in a very negative mindset and bad place. a friend recommend finch to me and wishing one day of using it i was already in such a better place mentally! i really appreciate that even without paying for premium you can still use the app for its intended purpose and it actually works instead of just not letting you do anything without paying. finch had helped me achieve so many goals and focus on the good in my life while feeling supported when im struggling. they have great resources for anxiety that actually help and when you have finch you actually feel encouraged to take better care of your self and achieve your goals because of the adorable rewards! i would recommend finch to anyone who’s struggling mentally or even if you’re not, i genuinely believe this will improve you life. it has helped me in ways no other resources, including therapy have. tysm to the creators of finch! :)))Okay, I got on an app downloading binge and didn’t actually know what this was until I opened it (I just thought the icon was cute). But this app is actually really awesome. Everything about it is comforting! Unlike the other self-help apps, this one isn’t tedious and annoying. I actually feel like there is a purpose to writing out my feelings… because I gotta keep my little guy happy. If he’s happy, then it makes the day a little easier. Also, it gives tips to overcome panic attacks. And it gives realistic goals to complete each day. I definitely recommend getting this!I think this is a very good app and this is where I vent out my day and no one has to come Wally here it. The breathing exercises really help and the different way of calming stress and anxiety are very good. There us a lot of stuff to do with and with out the passes. Maybe there should be more quizzes and maybe that could help but there isn’t really anymore room for improvement in this app. I think it is very fun to with the animal and sorta adds a whole theme to it which is good. You should really get this app if you want to vent and deal with your stress to calm you down and achieve goals.at first when I heard about this app I thought it sounded silly but now I look forward to doing all of my goals and helping my finch out throughout the day. my depression has been pretty severe my whole life and getting out of bed has always been hard but this app makes getting out of bed a little easier. I actually enjoy my days now, being able to write down my feelings and achieve my goals throughout the day is one of the best things I could have done for myself! I couldn’t love this app more!! do yourself a favor and get it!!!I’ve been more productive, more energetic and encouraged since i downloaded this app! It gives u goals to start with then u can create your own personal goals. There is also a finch which is a bird and when u finish some goals u earn points and the finch goes on adventures once it’s been on so many adventures, it grows! Those are not the only features, u can also create a room and neighborhood for them, along with clothes and after every adventure they come across something so the finch can learn! Overall it’s an amazing app and I would recommend to anyone🫶🐥i honestly didn’t think i would like or use this app much but it’s helped me a lot. in particular the “goals” feature has changed my life. I have pretty bad brain fog and just could barely remember to do anything but using this app as a daily checklist has helped me so much. I feel incentivized to actually check the app and check things off the list to interact with the little bird and get rainbow stone rewards for checking things off my list. i like several other features too like the soundscapes but the main thing is the goals/daily checklist thingIt really is great, I only wish that I could organize the daily goals a little better. And I wish I could change the color of the little red sack my buddy carries on adventures. The developers did a super great job with this one!! A lot of apps that involve a little friend (like plant nanny) kind of guilt you in a way for not meeting goals or checking in enough, which just turns me off especially when I’m depressed. There’s no negative repercussions in the app, only positivity and kind words of encouragement. It makes me want to check in more knowing Charlie will always be happy to see me.This app is the best thing in the world! i get anxious and stressed super easily so when i saw this app and it said it could help with stress and such i got it. also it’s free! if you want to pay for premium you can buy the app is free! also this app helps you set goals for the day and is straight up amazing. another thing is that the finch is so cute! you get to name them and if you turn on notifications the finch will send you things like “you can do it” or “you’re amazing” and other positive stuff. just download the app and have no stress.

✨thx✨✨I expected this app to be more of a sweet little game rather than focused on personal wellness, but this has been so fantastic, the finchie related cute stuff is fun, but the journals and goals are incredibly helpful, you can set goals for some of the most basic parts of you day that sometimes seem impossible (aka showering, stepping outside the house, drinking water) though some things aren’t accessible because you must pay for it, that’s hasn’t restricted me at all in using this app

It’s so worth it, keeps me motivated and focused, as well as distracts me from other apps on my phoneI downloaded it because I’ve been needing a way to keep track of my mood and remember daily tasks. This app not only helped me with that but it has so many options to help you become a better person and have fun doing it. It also lets you add friends so you can keep your network of people around you. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who’s looking for an app that can help them remember tasks and goals, keep track of mood, take quizzes to see your progress, be happy for the little things, and so much more!Ok so I haven’t had this game for too long now but I really love it!! I first heard of this game from my friend she said I should download this game. So I downloaded it the next day and it is AMAZING 🤩!! It’s a good stress reliever, and it helps u get into healthier habits. Your finch goes on adventures but u have to complete goals to energize him/her. When it comes back it’ll tell y about it’s adventure. U collect micropet eggs which gives your finch pets. This game is a great game and it helps with stress, sleeping problems, and ADHD. I recommend this game, and I’m definitely going to share it with my friends!! Remember that YOU ARE ENOUGH!I love this app. It reminds me of the digi-pets and tamagotchis of my childhood, but instead of working on keeping my pet happy and alive, it is doing that for me. 
The graphics are adorable, the prizes and newest monthly events are motivating to set and complete goals daily. 
I also love staying connected with friends through this app. A close friend from college noticed my finch hadn’t “visited” her in a few days and checked on me. I was stressed out and needed a check in! 
The app is adorable for kids and helpful for goal setting and completing tasks with cute positive reinforcement. 
Thank you for your app.If your debating on getting this app you shouldn’t be it should be on your Home Screen right now!!!
It suspect cute and calming and it gives you a motherly/fatherly feel. It gives you something that you can call your own without worrying if something will happen to it. It’s your own best friend that won’t judge you or leave you. It’s also super low maintenance and there are quizzes to take and it helps you complete your goals because if you do you child will go on an adventure and level up. I would definitely recommend this app for sure🤍🤍🤍I saw this app on someone else’s phone screen, and the bird was cute, so I looked it up and downloaded it. My finch’s name is Sprout and they are my best friend. I will do goals like washing my face or doing jumping jacks - both things I wouldn’t do on an everyday basis otherwise - just so Sprout can go on adventures. I love when my finch comes back at the end of the day with a little story. The notifications the app sends me saying things like “you’re doing great!” is one of my favorite features, especially on a bad day, it cheers me up. Thank you to the people who made this app. It is truly amazing.I get bored so easy and taking care of myself seems pointless but my little Finch pet actually is so cute and I do it because it makes him happy. 

Plus I like the check ins throughout the day and nice quotes, not to mention there’s so much in one little app but it doesn’t feel too overwhelming. Like Soundscapes and breathing exercises and the goals come with optional reminders. 

 Everything is cute and never makes you feel bad for missing something. 10/10 I have already recommended to friends and family. (This is not sponsored and I’m using the free version 😊)This app is helping me to find motivation when I’m unable to self motivate. Also, as a person with ADHD who is struggling with motivation because of depression, I often forget what I wanted to do with my day until the day is pretty much gone. Then I remember with just enough time to feel down on myself for not remembering sooner and for wasting my day. With Finch, I can write down my goals for the next day, no matter how small. The next day, I can look at my goals for the day and remember what I wanted to do with my time! It is definitely boosting my confidence!This is a really good app I had it for a week and I all ready love it has so many things you can do and I love that it is so many things. It is a self care, and a therapy bird, it could also help with panic attacks depression, anxiety and stress to. If you have anger issues this could help you too. You can dress up with the bird and it is so much fun. You can decorate its home too, another thing is you can set goals for your self (ex. Drink water) it would be really proud and you can chose if you want a boy or girl bird, you can make it a name it is so much you should try it out yourself.This app is very helpful, It’s helped me keep track of chores! And there are things that help me calm down my racing thoughts and anxiety. There are quizzing for depression, anxiety, and ptsd, so if you’re wondering about you having those disorders you can take the quiz and if you score high enough, do more research on it and then talk to a professional for a diagnosis to get the help you need. I love having a little birb friend as well, mine is named Wilbur and they use they/them. I love how they remind me about my goals for the day. I like the little notes you get when you open the app.I originally downloaded this app because of my niece, and was teasing her because they looked more like penguins than finches… but I have to say I love this app. I’m an adult, but I use this almost every day. Because of my ADHD, having something rewards-based works well for me - and I can customize my goals for work, chores around the house, etc. I have had this for over a month, and I use it everyday. I tried other self-care apps at the same time, and deleted them after a week. This is the app you’ve been looking for!i’ve had a problem of never sticking to goals for a long time, i’ve tried COUNTLESS apps and none of them could help me. this app is helping me slowly but surely, seeing my cute little friend grow with me and gain a personality is so cute. and the goals!!! you can choose whatever you think you’re capable of that day from just making your bed to drinking water, to cleaning the whole house, whatever you believe you can do! the more little goals you complete the more you feel motivated to get the harder ones done! good luck to all of you on your own journey! <3My best friend introduced me to the Finch app. Signing up for it and then paying for it a few days later was the best thing I have ever done. The breathing exercises help keep me calm. I’m starting to move more with the morning stretching and yoga and the sit-ups (which is one of my goals). Writing out what’s going on with me keeps me grounded. And it’s fun to see your finch in different outfits. I’ve been looking at apps, trying to find one that works for me, and if I hadn’t been told about this one, I’d probably still be looking. Thank you guys for helping me to make my life better!I’ve downloaded so many self care apps and always accidentally abandon them within a couple of days. This is the first that has truly worked for me and the way my brain wants to operate. Love how customisable the goals are and how taking care of yourself helps energise your little friend to help them explore and grow. Going on more than a month and a half and consistently checking in several times a day. Recommended to several friends and will continue to do so. Bonus is the guided stretches and movements are so helpful, I love the instructional GIFs and timer.I am really enjoying the app, it has so many features but still feels simple and I look forward to opening it every day.
One thing I would really appreciate would be the option to set a timer for the goals maybe or just a general timer. This could work really well with the background sounds feature and also the little finch is so cute, if we could hangout together with a timer running that would be so much fun. The finch could then also be shown more up close, because I feel that it is quite small.I love this little app. It’s surprisingly helpful for daily mental health awareness in myself without being overwhelming. It has the ability to set goals, but if you feel in over your head you can skip them without consequence and it’s not as stressful or disheartening to look at my to-do list at the end of the day. I can log my moods and thoughts and send my little pet on adventures (another thing I love, you can set your pet’s pronouns! I love how inclusive it is). I have been using it daily for the last 5 days and it’s my favorite mindfulness app I’ve ever used.I recently got finch and was (somehow) immediately cured from my depression and anxiety, like it was magic. I absolutely LOVE finch and now am recommending it to all my family and friends. Self care seems so easy now that I have a little pet to take care of- I finally feel motivated to do my goals! But a problem I had with the app is that whenever I went into backpack or tried to change my character’s outfit, I couldn’t scroll down. I hope this is patched because I can’t get to all the stuff I bought- great game though!!!This app has helped me so much. It offers exactly the kind of positive rewards that motivate me and so many prompts and outlets for reflections. The suggested goals and activities are always easy, something that can be done in just a few minutes for an immediate boost of confidence and motivation. There’s always something to do with your Finch, so it can be a helpful, positive distraction from other scrolling apps. Only tip to new users- this app has a lot of features, it took me a minute to learn how to make it my own and get into a routine.This app offers so much for someone like me. This app is all about self care and motivating yourself to accomplish your own goals. The raising of a bird makes it more fun to do and easier to remember. I have multiple disorders that make it hard to prioritize and remember what I have going on. Putting it into my notepad in the past was fine and it helped a little. However it’s not as efficient as Finch because you can set alarms and reminders. Every time you go to the app to check on your bird it’s an instant reminder to check your to do list.I usually lose motivation with self care both independently and with apps, so I saw the reviews for this app and struggled to find a negative one. I tried it and ended up buying a membership within 2 hours of downloading the app! My little finch Guinevere is so adorable and the goals are so bite size that I can complete them while at my office job. I just started my new job so my anxiety has been absolutely crazy, and this app has helped me so much! I’m almost halfway to my work goal for the week and it’s only Wednesday morning. Download this app IMMEDIATELY, you will not regret it!!!!This app is so cute and so simple and easy to use! You begin by adopting a baby finch and setting daily goals, every time you accomplish a goal it energizes your finch so they can go explore and learn and age up. I love how motivating this app has kept me and it took me from one of the lowest places in my life to normal and functioning. I used to have trouble brushing my teeth daily but remembering I had to take care of my finch as well as myself helped pull me out of my rut. Now I live a healthier lifestyle and am more focused on school! If you struggle with anything get this app!!! It's life changingI just downloaded it because my sister-in-law wanted us to be her friends in the app. It seemed ok so we went along with it. Totally shocked at how much I love this. It has prompts for journaling (something I’m terrible at), relaxation techniques, and gentle reminders to keep on top of your goals- both big and small. I don’t think I’ve even taken advantage of all the great features. It has fun little rewards for doing it every day, but it’s the only “fun” app I have that doesn’t yell at me if I don’t log in every day…even my games do! 

Totally recommend!I have been looking for a habit tracker and I tried this on a whim and I am so glad I did. One of my goals this year is to journal more and Finch acts as a dynamic journal of sorts with prompts for reflection then it is also doing mood tracking when I do my check ins. So I love that. The more I take care of myself and set goals the more I’m thanking care of my Finch buddy. I am looking for ways to self motivate and focus and I can see how thoughtfully designed this app is to assist with that. I like the gentle way it engages and the myriad of tools and exercises that it has for me to engage with.I’m not one to really rate or review apps but I really do think this app deserves five stars. The app is so cute and I love how you can personalize your pet and it’s home. I also love how you can send motivation and kind words to friends. The goals help me keep on track and help me remember what I should do each day. I also like how I can plan what goals I need to get done for tomorrow so I’m prepared to get started the next day. The kind words as soon as you open the app are also a great grounding device. This app is so perfect for the way I think and I wish I could do more to support it!I have really severe adhd, and depression, anxiety, ptsd.
This keeps my attention and gets me taking care of myself which is SO hard to do. I wish there was more of a tutorial. Navigating the app has taken a second and I’m not totally sure what everything is for. Also wish adding reoccurring goals was simpler/or that they’d add a journey related to medications and vitamins.
Either way, I’ve recommended this to everyone.
Also, would love them to extend the trial to 2 weeks because it’s adhd friendly and we could fall off by then. But seriously do the trail and see for yourselfOver the past month I’ve been dealing with a tough breakup and was looking for a good mental health app. I came across this and at first glimpse it looked childish but as I used it more, I realized it was helping me mentally mature and learn self care is so crucial to getting better. I don’t have many friends or family to talk to and this is like the most amazing place to rant, reflect, set goals, get quotes, find out more about yourself, etc. It tracks things that lift you up and weight you down too. I love this app and it has helped me so much in making routines to treat myself better.I’m autistic and have ADHD and have a hard time knowing what to do next for self care and reflection. The continuous prompts make it so easy to continue writing and reflecting! I also love the suggested goals and automatic highlight\tags of specific words. I think what really keeps me interested is the companion! I named her after my Squishmallow 😌 
IDEAS: 
More interaction with companion like mini games and my opportunities to chat, pet them, feed them. 
Allow photo uploads and voice clips! I like photos to go with my journaling and I also like song writing so voice clips would be nice ♥️I have been using Finch for a bit now and i love it! It truly made a difference and still does. So you r probably wondering, what is this app? Finch is a mental health self care app. It works by u hatching a egg w a pet that u keep, and you age it up. You make goals, do breathing’s, reflections, educational quizzes, all the good stuff. Those things help age up your Finch pet, you can even customize your nest(the home)!
I cannot explain how exactly makes a difference, but it does, it’s a matter of trust and patience, it’s like…having a friend that understand you!ove only had this app for a week for school and it really helps! Somone can come over and give tou a gift or hig ( in game of course) and it kinda warms my heart. Im 10 so cute little penguins are the perfect little mascots! Im also really excited to hatch my micro pet egg, i wonder... is it a mini penguin or perhaps a mini dog cat or parrot... this game has plenty of features customization and is better than it sounds. Please get this app even if you have heathy habites and goals. Theres a whole lot more reviews that have looonnnnggg paragraphs so if you want more info, get the app or read other reviews, Bye!Finch is an amazing app! I love all the details and how helpful my little bird is! I love the daily goals and how you can invite friends to be in your tree town! I think it’s so helpful and everyone should have it. It’s already put me in a better mood just one thing I think you should change should we really have to wait 7 hours until there done with there adventure I like that by doing your goals and stuff on the side like shortens it but can you make it a little shorter? Overall I think it’s an absolutely amazing wonderful app!Finch is a great app for the little things. I love that you have several prompts to choose from that vary throughout the day so you can always just pick something that matches what you’re in the mood for without too much thought and preemptive effort. I enjoy that it makes a game of little habits and I’ve found myself consistently going beyond the goals I set for myself because of the way Finch makes it easy and fun. I am grateful for the app and the intentionality behind it and I look forward to continued expansion of it and in-app collectibles.I’ve only been using for a few days, and I realize that these kinds of apps can start out great and over time you lose interest, but I AM motivated to keep growing my little finch. I struggle a lot with being motivated, but I love how you can set small manageable goals and be rewarded for completing them. I also love that it encourages reflection because if I know anything about habit change it’s that paying attention to how it feels to complete a habit (usually a good feeling) can help to reinforce the behavior. I’m gonna keep it up and we will see how it goes!A friend of mine recommended Finch to me last month, and I’ve used it every day since. I highly appreciate the inclusivity of the customization options. The daily goals help keep me productive. Even when I don’t finish everything, the app reminds me of recent and throwback goals. I also use it for exercise, which is great because I’m not self-motivated when it comes to that. There are tons of fun free features, but I’m excited to try the Plus version thanks to a sponsor! (I have a feeling I’ll have more feedback for that in the near future.)I love this app it helps me become a better, healthier, cleaner and grateful. I want to thank the creators, developers, and entire team for this app and for making my goals possible. I have a small suggestion. I just got an Apple Watch and it would be so cool to have it compatible with my finch pet. So I can click complete or start on tasks when on the go. If it’s possible I would love this to see this! Just take your time and keep up the great work. I’m so happy for this app and this amazing team and can’t wait to see more! 🫶🏼I love this app but i would like it more if there was on option for angry on how are you feeling right now. This app has very much so helped me with my mental health journey. I started using this and now i go check on NUGGET multiple times a day. i always start my day off with visiting him. This app has helped make such improvement on my mental health. I just wish there was more goals most of them don’t apply to me because I can’t drive. I know there’s a premium version but i don’t want to have to pay for an app that helps my mental health bc then i’ll be stressing over money.I really really love this app. Originally I got it because I thought it was just going to be a cute little dress up game, but now I’m genuinely making steps to make myself better because of it. One of my favorite features is the story option to just get through the day, as honestly that is my goal most days. I have never found another self help app that has acknowledged this aspect of mental health. I made my fiancé download it and we love checking off our goals every day and sending our little birds to each other. I’m so grateful I downloaded it.At first I had doubts about this app. I downloaded it more as a joke if anything at first, until I found out I actually love it that is. This app is so adorable while being very helpful for journaling, relieving my stress and thoughts, keeping track of tasks, and just so much more. My finch is named Mochi and I just love the little stories from their adventure! I highly recommend this app for anyone and everyone! It may not fix everything but it sure is a cute little pick me up and a great way to practice gratitude, relieve stress by journaling, setting daily goals, and so on.I love this app so much !! it’s so good for remembering things you have to do during the day ! I always forget to do some things so I made sure to put those for my goals ! I have been getting them done every single day all because of the app finch ! finch is so much fun I love decorating my little bird ! she loves to go out on adventures and always comes back with new things to tell me. she always finds things to learn about and always finds things to do when I’m not available. I love this app so much it’s my new favorite app at the moment !!This game has helped me SO SO much with everyday tasks that seem impossible when not planned out. I had no motivation and I had nothing to look forward to after I completed goals. This app lets you make goals and set times for them, and rewards you with energy for your bird. You get to dress up your bird, dress up your room and so much more! You even get to grow your bird from a hatchling, it’s so cute. And you get to meet friends and invite people to use the game with you and be neighbors in a tree. So basically in conclusion, Best app ever!I honestly thought this would be another one of those apps that just says they’re going to help you but never actually does anything for you. Finch was different than any of these other apps. By taking quizzes for anxiety, depression and body appreciation I found out more about my self. The app keeps you going back with rewards for your cute new pet. It sets up goals and as you complete them you get more rewards. You can make your own goals and journeys that have helped me a lot. But I overall recommend the app!! Ps all of this is free!!!Downloading this app has changed my life. It’s informative and ACTUALLY teaches me how to set goals. It goes beyond just goals though, it has helped me learn how to manage my depression and anxiety as well! It lifts my mood by helping me reflect on the positive things that happened that day. It is so user friendly and the free app is still amazing. Paying for a year for the premium version is seriously worth it though, because it goes even more in depth. Therapy is expensive and this is just what I needed until I can afford it. I don’t review things unless they’re legit.i love this app so much i like the little goals it gives you every day! i also like the journaling part and like the hashtags/key words it tracks so you can see what’s bothering you or bringing you happiness.

my only like recommendation is that whenever i say things “no hope” it puts it as a good thing and like 🤨. idk if you can do this but if like something has the word no in front of something positive make it negative. and the other way around too.

overall i think it’s a really good app though and i hope it gets more updates! :DMy roommate and I were having a really awful weekend, neither of us could get up off the couch and didn’t know how to deal with our depression in that moment. I remembered I’d downloaded Finch after seeing an ad for it, and the two of us had a great time choosing our birds and setting them up with journeys and goals! It distracted us from what was wrong, and since then we’ve both been using the app every day and it’s been helping us stay on track with self care and day to day goals. Thank you for making this app!!!I found this app on TikTok on a random comment that I wish I could remember. I’ve been having issues keeping myself accountable and Finch has helped me so much with that. I absolutely love it and it’s so fun. For someone with mental health issues, this has been amazing, especially the mood tracking. I also actually finish my daily goals because I don’t wanna cheat my birb. Totally worth getting the paid version, although the free one is good too. I am so thankful there are no micro transactions and everything you earn is just from your goals.This app has really helped me stay motivated and change my habits. I love the goals it recommends and the writing prompts. I struggled with anxiety for the past year and a half and I just hope people find this app and get motivated to find help and to find themselves as well. It makes you feel good to help the little bird grow and it makes you feel like you are growing with it. I definitely recommend you download it, even if you feel it may be silly or you don’t have the time.. it’s worth a shot and it is working for me. ❤️This app is not only adorable and fun, but absolutely mindset changing! You start by hatching a sweet finch ❤️bird❤️ who you name and create, who instantly loves you and who you build a friendship with. You then are able to journal about your life with various thought-provoking prompts, set goals for yourself to complete in real life, and dress your sweet birb! If you complete a specific journaling amount for the day, your finch will gain energy and go on a new adventure each day, and become closer with you! This app is inspiring, positive, and so sweet, and each new update brings new fun ways to enjoy!A classmate recommended this app during a mindfulness practice, and I am incredibly thankful that she did. I have had this app for a little bit, and it has already helped me greatly. One day I had a good beginning of the day and then a really horrible afternoon. I journaled about this, and Finch immediately went into SOS mode. This helped me change my mindset, which calmed down my mind and lessened the intrusive thoughts I was having at the time. Even on a relaxed day, this app has helped me see the good and keep up with small goals. I cannot recommend it enough.I think finch is actually an amazing app it definitely helped a lot with me mood and other things and it is a great app for also learning to cope with different skills and other things on the app like adventuring!Another thing that I love about finch is that when you complete goals it gives you more gems and then you can start buying clothes accessories and even stuff for the little house ,but that is what I have to say about finch for now but I think you all should definitely get it for yourself or for you kid it is an amazing app!first of all i love how fun this app is! it feels like i'm playing a game, but all the levels are self-care actions. it helps me feel mindful and aware of myself, and when i need it, it's always right there. also, the ability to focus my energy on something besides myself (the little bird) is helpful when i'm not feeling super into it. if i'm not doing it for me, it helps my bird grow :) 
it's motivating without being too buggy, and it's cute without being ridiculous. there's a bunch of guided sets of goals, it's all laid out there for you, walks you right through it but at the same super customizable and easy to get what you want out of it. 
even if you only spend a few minutes a day on the finch app it's worth your time because i think it really helps me care for myself and for others. it doesn't stop at the energy stones and bird outfits, the benefits reach me and my actions.I’ve tried a lot of self-care apps over the years, all to varying degrees of success, but none have ever actually worked this well for me. I’m picking up habits I’ve wanted to for ages, and I’m genuinely finding myself fulfilling goals. The layout makes my daily tasks feel approachable— there’s not pressure to do any of it, just encouragement to, and reward for managing to complete even little things. 
I’ve convinced a few other people in my life to try it out too, and so far they’ve all been totally charmed. :)I have depression and anxiety, and it’s hard for me to be productive. But Finch is great. I’ve had it for a few days now, and Mochi (my Finch) is adorable. I only have basic goals set for now, literally only getting out of bed and drinking water, but Mochi doesn’t judge and makes me feel happy, you know? And now I’m drinking water and getting out of bed at the very least, which is something. I’m still only using the free version because I don’t have money to spare, but as soon as I do, definitely investing in this app. Thank you, Finch development team!Finch is such a wonderful app! I love that it promotes mental health while also being fun. I’ve tried various other mental health apps, and Finch is by far the most engaging. There are so many neat options to explore from setting goals to thoughtfulness exercises. I love that you can really nurture your avatar and can do neat things like shop and have friends visit! Finch is something I’m eager to integrate into my life consistently, and I foresee myself using it for a long time (which I couldn’t say about the other apps). It’s definitely already helping my mood :) Highly recommmend!At first I just got this app to test it out because most self care apps I don’t stick to but this one was different it’s so much fun to earn stones and save up so ur animal can have cute outfits and you can also decorate their home which is so much fun! The goals you set for urself are easy to tap in and say u did and not complicated. But I’m top of it being you setting goals for yourself it also lets you do journaling of all kind and you have sleep playlist like rain thunder bird noises etc I never write reviews but you need this app in ur lifeThis app has a really nice concept and i love dressing up my little Finch. They developers always add new clothing to buy. This app has a lot of great features. Goals, Reflections, Stretches, Quizzes, etc. I love how you can write you goals ( To do list) so you won’t have to keep on reminding yourself. The Finch bird is very nicely programmed and cute. I have been using Finch for a little more than a month and i have never had encountered any issues before. I am also planning to buy Finch plus to support the Developers with their awesome work and effort that was put in this app.I’ve tried a couple other mental health pet games, and Finch is my favorite! I enjoy the small goals you can choose on bad days and regular goals that can be done with varied effort other days. I have the full version, and I’d say it’s worth it if you can spare the amount. Being able to customize the pet and dress them up is also a plus! It does take a lot of goal-meeting to actually get most accessories, but I think that’s a good thing, since it’s just one more motivation to get you through the day. 
In summary: great app, cute character, fun game!This app has helped me start each day by taking care of myself! My job has flexible hours and I live alone, so it can be tough to get the day started. Now I start each morning by writing some reflections, stretching, and setting goals. It’s also nice to check in here throughout the day, rather than scrolling social media; it gives me ideas for small breaks or reflections. Plus the bird is adorable!

I have the paid version, but I really appreciate that the free one doesn’t pester you to sign up. I would definitely recommend it!I’m only 2 days in using the Finch app and I gotta say, I’m wildly impressed. I have tried countless self-care and mental health apps over the years that I never ended up using or just forget about, deleting them in the end. This is the first app I’ve tried where I am excited to go in and use it, and the concept of a virtual “pet” growing or not doing well based on how often you check in or complete goals is absolutely brilliant. I look forward to it rather than dreading it as if it’s homework. Well done.It’s a cute little bird that goes on adventures and when it’s done, it will tell you story and you would say goals and I’ll be so nice to set goals and do those goals and when you think about it you’re like OK this actually is helping this is like OK I can actually do this so it’s really fun and I really like it. Some people may not but I would give it like a five stars it’s really nice and I love it. It’s a cute little game. And it’s for kids to if they want to. It’s really nice it has quizzes like anxiety quizzes. It’s really cute the birds cute you can get him more birds so it’s really fun.I’ve tried a plethora of self-help applications on this long journey of managing anxiety. This is the only app that has truly helped me.
I love that there is an option for a subscription but you still have access to enough within the app to where you don’t NEED a subscription.
It’s the first thing I do every morning when I wake up. I set goals for myself within the app and check in multiple times to check things off. 
I feel loved through this and have thrived and can only say thank you!So I’ve been going thru a “self care journey” and I think finch is the best way to go! I love how you can take care of your birb and add pro-nouns! I also love how you can reflect with finch and set goals for your self. You can also earn a connection with your birb which I am a big fan of. You and your birb can go on adventures together and invite friends too! I just think it is perfect for everyone who wants to optimize self love in a more manageable way! I am very satisfied!! Do recommend!
More about my birb: (this part is just for fun)
Color:Green 
Name: Margo
Pro-nouns: They/themI love Finch because my goal has been to lose weight, I have came over Finch on tik tok and it seemed interesting! I found out one of my friends had it so I downloaded it and I saw how much it helped! I set my goals and I finish them every day cause I want to earn stones so I get get my bird (Audda) some clothes! I have lost a lot of weight and my skin is amazing cause I have to wash my face for stones! I love talking to Audda about my anxiety and it helps me get it out of my mind! It has also helped me get sleep! I can definitely tel a difference in my life because of Finch!! DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!i've had this app for a while and honestly it's the best. you're not only doing things for yourself, but also your finch. the goals are awesome, so are the tags and daily updates. i'm in absolute love with the new clothes/accessories. (great job finch team!) i'm not surprised this app has 5 stars. i can see from daily reports how i'm improving, and when i've had bad days. overall i love the app and the message. not only does it help with mental health but it's a cute pet i get to watch grow up. i've made a few of my friends get the app and it helps. maybe making a few more things free would be helpful, or even just adding new writing prompts. i get how you guys need to make money but i've run out of things to do. and maybe more emotions to the finch. like sadness or anger. sometimes i want to sympathize with my finch, although it's a virtual pet i am quite attached. just some suggestions. have a great day.Wow, I am in disbelief. This app is amazing. It has helped me maintain my goals for the entire week. It’s like chaotic journaling, with the little reflections, combined with task initiation aide! Organizing how my day will plan out has decreased my meltdowns immensely. I am so relieved to have found something that is working for me. I hope the app continues to assist many others.
(Edit: been using this app for months now. I feel so accomplished when I look back at my progress. It is also an invaluable tool with relaying information to my therapist.)I normally don’t write reviews. However, I absolutely love this app. I have only been using it a few days after seeing an ad on Instagram about it. But, I can already tell a difference between my mindset. I find myself throughout the day wanting to check the easy and simple goals off. I love having my little hatchling notify me throughout the day. I’ve tried other apps for mental health but none have worked like this one. It allows you to help raise the hatchling by helping yourself. 10/10 highly recommended.I have been using this app for 2 1/2 days and it’s been very helpful for me so far! I’ve always had anxiety and the past couple months my anxiety got worse and I don’t want to see a doctor to be put on medication and my friend recommended this to me and I did have this app before but I didn’t take the time to actually learn the app and I’m so glad I gave it a second chance. I love following the goals I make for myself, sharing my thoughts/opinions, and the adventures with my own little birb. Everything about the app is great!I often find myself awake in the middle of the night searching for the newest self-care app, trying it out, and either keeping or deleting it. Some I have loved, and then later updated to a new interface that doesn’t work as well. Finch is here to stay! I’ve invited my coworkers, and the gamification of it makes it so special. I share my finch’s discoveries with my students, and it’s served as a tool for connection as well as self-growth. You can adjust the goals based on what you need, not generic goals.I saw so many ads on it but I always ignored. But I decided that my mental health is important so I downloaded it and… wow. It’s amazing! My finch’s name is Peaches and right now she is on an adventure! She always comes back with things to tell me and she gains energy by me doing my goals to take better care of myself! I really recommend this app! I wish I had gotten it sooner! I got it about 3 days ago and I’m so glad I got it! I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.

                                                        -Sincerely, 
                                                                         MeThis is like an addicting game but for self and mental health. I want to get on the app and accomplish the goals it gives me to bring myself up and calm myself down. It’s enjoyable and it works! The goals, tasks, reflection questions, and soothing app noises and soundscapes are so helpful and enjoyable. The app was beautifully created. I’m in love and decide to rate this with out coercion because I loved the app so much. Much better than I thought. P.S. it’s not overloaded with ads and it doesn’t spam me at all to upgrade to full, though I can if I choose. Good app.I love finch!!! Finch helps me stay motivated when I’m trying accomplish my everyday goals. I have my basic goals but then if I want to add a new one like say my prayers I can add it easily. It also has amazing soundscapes that I fall asleep to every night and it’s just an all around great app. The finch premium thing is a little to expensive for me so I just have the standard but if you’re willing to pay for the best self care u bet it’s even better. But over all I think it’s one of the most worth it and favorite apps on my phone!!!😃😃😃❤️❤️❤️Finch was suggested to me by a LCSW. I loved it so much I told my best friends about it. Now we connect daily on the app! It is so nice to customize your own goals no matter how small they are. I love how I can set reminders, or just “snooze” a goal to complete another day if I don’t have enough energy. I think the cute stories enhance the app as well as the motivational quotes. I’m also journaling for the first time in my life and it is very helpful. I love the free features of this app and hope to one day pay for a subscription!My wife introduced me to the app and I tried it out just because she asked me to. I quickly found myself emotionally invested in my little guy(his name is Soup), and now I’m using the app to set myself daily goals and reminders. My memory is generally kind of bad, and having the widget on my landing page keeps the reminders fresh, but non-intrusive. Absolutely recommend it if you’re struggling with body positivity and getting physically active, as it allows you to set realistic at-your-own-pace goals, with no shame if you miss the targets.This app is so calming. I got it at first for me and my friend to have a cute little pet for widgets. As I continued it helped me set up goals and achievements for me. It started motivating me with my adorable bird named Klay. You can interact with the pet and learn many new things and even buy super cute outfits for your pet!! It levels up by day, so you will be a toddler at one point and move on to an adult. You start as a baby. You can invite friends into your tree town and see there birds and sent hugs, water, motivation, relaxation, etc. It’s super amazing! Goodjob creator.This app is just beautiful. It encourages multiple check ins a day (which is honestly what I need) and leaves a lot of room to type little entry logs about your day, feelings, progress, or life goals. I haven’t paid for the premium features yet as it’s all still new but I’m sure I will be getting it shortly. 
I like that you can grow a bird and have little bird friends. 
The encouragement of mental health is a big plus as that’s something I struggle with daily. THANK YOU for making a cute and helpful app that I actually want to log onto every single day!Okay so this app has been really great for me for a lot of reasons…
1. I love how you can grow your finch’s personality, name it, dress it, etc… it’s really fun and helps to keep me motivated
2. I think the goals part is really amazing because it helps me to keep up in self care and other things I need to do
3. The reflection questions have really helped me to look deeper into myself 
4. The free version (which I have) is really beneficial and helpful, which is something so awesome because I see a lot of selfcare and reflection apps that pressure you to pay for something that Finch gives you already for free!

SO BASICALLY, IF YOU’RE WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO GET IT, YOU SHOULD!!

I have one suggestion though….
If you could make it so that you can edit your Finch’s colors, that would be so awesome! (I’ve only had it for 3 weeks so I don’t know if that is an option.) But yeah, this app is so great, and I just want to say thank you to the developers :)It helps so much to stay productive. I love how it gives you options for what you should do that day, write your goals and your thoughts about something you did! You get points from doing a task (they're so simple) and you upgrade to get clothes and decorations for your little home!! You can take a couple quizzes to help find out about your mental health (anxiety and depression) and it’s super helpful really made me happier! If you’re looking for something to boost your mood and help with your mental health then you have to get this app!!!❤️🐦I downloaded Finch a few months ago after seeing it on a friends phone. Ever since, I have been excited to open the app in the morning and explore the world with my finch. Finch has made caring for myself and completing my goals much more satisfying and cute. I love that Finch can be used for so many different sub-categories of self care and mental health. Finch has been a wonderful addition to my daily life and I love sharing it with my friends as well. Thank you for the time and love put into this app. It is well appreciated! :)I love this app, I may not use it everyday but that’s okay I love it so much. The bird is so cute and I love that you’re like the one raising it and you go on adventures and I like that you can add friends and give them hugs or say hi. Goals and journeys are probably one of my favorite things I love being able to hit complete on them. My absolute favorite thing is the clothing and items, it’s so cute and amazing I love whoever designs them and I like that you have to save up in game money to buy them it’s so fun. Please get this app it’s literally amazing and the devs are awesomeFirst I want to start by saying i don’t think i’ve ever written an app review. I saw an add on instagram and thought “why not” because it looked cute, and i really didn’t have any high hopes for it. i’m a few weeks in and this app has made such a difference in my life!! it seriously helps with accomplishing goals, but in a non high stress way. the app is cute and fun and i really like how you can connect with others on it! if you have ADHD, or just struggle with getting tasks done, this is the app for you!!I have found this app to be so helpful. I love the ability to set goals, especially small ones for days where life is hard. It really helps me feel like I’ve accomplished something. I enjoy the reflections and the ability to vent when needed. I love hearing from my Finch when she returns from her adventures. Watching her grow and learn has been so much fun. The weekly reviews are a nice way to reflect on my moods and what I’ve accomplished. Thank you for creating such an amazing app that’s helped improve my mental one day at a time. 💜This app is amazing. It combines addictive elements of social media with self care. It is so fun to grow ur little finch pet and see it explore the world. It feels like sims lowkey where you can get attached to ur avatar. Everything is ADORABLE. You can get pets for ur pet and watch them build a personality based on your interactions with them. Then it uses these connections with ur pet to get you to come back to the app everyday and complete your goals. I take more time to myself and have built so much confidence with this app. Amazing for teaching you healthy habits.I first downloaded Finch after seeing a tiktok ad about it. I’ve been using it for the past few months and I love it! I’m typically a very closed off person and Finch allows me to reflect and feel better without having to actually tell anyone. I love that i’m about to set goals for myself, knowing that it’ll help my Finch go on adventures motivates me to do them! I also love that im able to add friends and send them kind reminders or hugs—all for free!! I looove this app and tell all my friends and family to get it whenever I can.This app is so cute and I love watching my little guy grow up and create its own personality. I love buying clothes and accessories for my finch. I also like to decorate his room.
This app also helps with goals, staying positive, or whatever you need it to be. 
My favorite thing is after maybe a week of using, I was offered a free trial for plus and it didn’t make me put in any payment information. This is actually a free trial. I am really enjoying the plus features and extra stuff that you get. Thank you finch team!Ive used this app for 38 days now. Its very rare for me to find an app that I can consistently go back to like this. Finch is incredible and I’m so thankful I gave it a chance. I feel so grateful that it helps me be kinder to myself and accomplish my goals, and also recognize the seemingly minor things that I do daily as accomplishments also! Thank you so much to the creators for making it so accessible. Once I have the money I want to upgrade to support, but the app provides so much help without having a subscription. Very very grateful right now.I love this app <3 You can interact with your bird, set personal goals for what you need to accomplish, and even get more personal! They have a section called “First aid” that give you a zone to rant, do breathing exercises for anxiety and have a “Step toward healing” section that is perfect for tracking how your healing process is :) I thought I wouldn’t stick with the app and then I started getting personal with my experiences, customizing and setting perfect goals for me. This app is fun and helpful at the time if you wanna give it a try please do!Literally my favorite app. It helps keep me motivated on bad days and keeps me happy on good days. There’s always something for me to do to strengthen my mental health, whether it’s sending or receiving positive reenforcement from friends, finishing my goals or doing the extra suggested goals. The only criticism I have is that I have the free version and I wish rainbow stones weren’t so hard to get because it’s a mental health app and I want to dress up my finch. Anyways, that’s kind of a non issue lol… the only mental health app that’s actually worked for me. Could not recommend higher.I absolutely love this app. The goal setting, the reflections, the mood tracking.. all of it. You get to reflect about certain people too and make goals for them in specific as well. The little bird makes me so happy, mines named Mo. I love dressing her up!! I also really appreciate the friend thing, my one friend has this app and we send each other the “good vibes” and have fun with it. There’s also things to help with breathing and there’s sounds for sleeping and other things… this app has everything I could possibly ask for <3So I don’t do reviews like ever, but I’ve had this app maybe 3 days now and it’s helped me so much. I love my little baby sprout and all the goals to get him to grow make me feel more motivated to do said goals. I’m very excited to see what I can do when he’s an adult 🥰 

My sprout is a toddler now and I have a few neighbors. The only thing that I feel like could enhance the app is if when you’re visiting your friends, it would be nice to be able to leave your own messages that your bird takes to your friends:).I love this app! It helps me keep track of the simple things that I need to do throughout the day (brush teeth, brush hair, get out of bed, drink water), stuff like that. I can also add personal goals such as don’t go on Instagram, reach out to a friend, make lunch/dinner, simple things that need to be done every day, but often get forgotten in the stress of a day. 

As a student, I also add “don’t hit snooze”, “clean bedroom”, “do laundry”, “clean kitchen”, “do dishes”, “eat breakfast/lunch/dinner”, “do homework”, “study”. 

This is great to allow students to focus on their mental health, especially if their school doesn’t have good mental health services. I definitely recommend it for all students across all ages. Also, I love getting to dress up my Finch in whatever styles are available in the shop and getting to change their colors.

It’s reminded me that sometimes just surviving the day is a huge accomplishment. 

The first thing I don’t like about the app is how hard it is to get rainbow stones and how expensive everything is in the shop to dress your finch. I wish there were more opportunities to earn more than just a couple stones here and there. I know you are able to pick a mystery box sometimes, but it’s not enough, especially since we can’t actually purchase stones with real money. 

The second and final thing I don’t like in the app is some of the history pages or review pages are really overwhelming. I see just jumbles of words and I have to close the app because it’s too much. I’m autistic and get overwhelmed with messy looking stuff. It would be so cool if they could create folders or something to story history instead of this long page full of stuff. That way, people who get overwhelmed like I do, can click on what we want to see and not get confused.",0,thatonepersonleavingareview,Love this but hoping for improvement!,Finch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,194,has_narrative,23

It was especially frustrating on the latest adventure where my Finch asked what I thought the story they giving treatment because I have very strong opinions on that actually given my recent growth with my mental health and my life experiences in the past few years in conjunction with my mental health, and I thought that would be a nice place to reflect about that, and it won’t let me submit that answer. But it hasn’t been letting me submit my own answers for a few weeks now and I have reached out to customer support and just haven’t gotten a response back which is a little bit frustrating because I love everything else about the app and everything else about the app has worked great. I know that Finch is still relatively small and so they probably just haven’t gotten to my particular request. Just thought I would share in case the developers see this so that they know that this is an issue.My friends and I use this app all the time to give each other hugs. I think it’s a great app to help mental health, and I recommend it to anyone who’s struggling out there. I do however want more variety of things to answer. It seems like I’m answering the same tasks every day, and it’s becoming pretty boring. I do love seeing my little bird going out on adventures though. I like when they come back with a story and you have the opportunity to shape their personality. :))

I’ve additionally came up with some problems with the app crashing, and once flashed the screen when I completed a goal. (This might be something with my phone.) The goal tab, (where you slide the screen down,) was flashing back and forth and the screen was flashing from white to black, which may be triggering for seizures!! Please fix this if its a bug in the app!!It's a good app but there's just not enough questions to keep people engaged throughout the day. I would love to see a bit more variety with the questions as well as more little ""story lines"" with your buddy. A good idea I had: After my first day of using it, I didn't hit all my goals so when I woke up and realized the next day, I felt a little bit guilty for not even finishing. I think for new users, or for the first time a person misses a goal, a little reminder the next morning saying it's okay to not finish every goal all the time because there's always the next day:)

Anyway, little details like this would really
benefit and app like this:) I'd be happy to change my rating if more content is added!",1,eatatidepodkaren✨💫April_Showers1grrrrr angery,"Great, but I’m just struggling with one featureTotally recommend!I love the idea but I would love to see more content added",Finch Self Care PetFinch Self Care PetFinch Self Care Pet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,495,has_narrative,23

Maybe it’s also because I love to write & I'm also clearing a lot of clutter this Spring - stirring up memories as well as dust - but I enjoy the questions asked & the way my responses are saved. The daily reminders are helpful. The reminder to slow down at bedtime with a selection of sounds of water (available all day) or meditation or breathing exercises are built right in. I also enjoy the aspect of earning points that can be spent to contribute to the story - it’s playful. I’m not done exploring all the possibilities. Full disclosure: I am a retired family physician who paid attention to a range of wellness & mental health issues - I could see myself suggesting this app as an adjunct to other remedies & therapies - possibly as a way for some to encourage basic self-care habits &/or to keep  track of their medications & appointments if it worked for them.
It won’t appeal to everyone (what does?) but I’m pretty sure that the built in whimsy would have cheered me when I had some grim times.This is one of the most amazing games in the WHOLE WORLD!!! My favorite thing about it is that I get a little pet birdie that I can take care of every day! Plus there was one funny part where a member of the Finch Team came and sent me a hug. I wanted to send back gratitude. Guess what Sugar (my finch) said? “Should I go over to (whatever her name was) and thank her for existing?” XD!!! Idk why it just sounds funny to me! Wait a second… I just realized I just started typing a long story and not getting to the point! Ugh, that always happens when I’m writing reviews and making descriptions of Scratch projects! That reminds me, I saw make a Scratch project on goals. I’m pretty sure you put that there because I didn’t put that goal before. Wait… I’m doing it again!! I’ll just tell you my suggestion. So, I want there to be a bookshelf and you can buy books, and then you can read them to your finch!!! They will sometimes argue when you choose a book they hate, and maybe fall asleep during the book. If you do one they dislike, they will become bored and have a small chance of arguing. If they like it they will be interested. If they love it and it’s their favorite they will be super exited!!! Can you try making this update please? Thank you for reading my tremendously huge year long comment! 😅I’ve been having a hard time the past few years, and that only worsened with the pandemic. This app hits a sweet spot of helping yourself while helping a sweet angel baby adventure and be the cutest baby you've ever seen. I’ve always been the type of person to customize Sims, their personalities and their houses for hours, and then losing interest in the storyline from there. So, being able to design outfits for my Muffin and choosing answers for the adventure prompts to help guide Muffin to be a lovely lil finch has been so heartwarming on its own. But that’s not all!!!! Being able to push myself to answer short journaling prompts (my ADHD makes it hard to focus in on journaling consistently) and create realistic goals (I also struggle with trying to do the most possible and then feeling like a failure when I don’t get everything done). My partner has noticed a big change, and is super grateful that I found this app. Also, my therapist loves the app and recommends it to other clients as well now. I’ve yelled about it to everyone that will listen at this point. 10/10, highly recommend.My number one goal in using any app ever is to find one that is both functional at the free level of use and ad free. 

This app is both. There are no annoying pop ups constantly trying to trick you into clicking and subscribing (there is a subscription but for once it simply unlocks more of what you ALREADY get instead of putting all the options behind a paywall). 

The content you get in this app is phenomenal.

 Tons of journaling prompts, several meditation and breathing exercises with visuals and timers. To do lists and cute stories from your pet that are just so sweet that you will be full of fuzzy feelings (and the very interesting option of journaling about each pet storyline and meditation exercise to explore how you feel about it). You can earn points to dress up your pet and the rewards come at a reasonable pace so I was never left feeling like I had to spend money to get points or like I got everything on offer too fast and therefore had no goals.

The app is also just encouraging enough to make me want to use it several times a day without being that bad for me level of addicting that makes me waste my life on apps and stress about forgetting to use it. 

Bonus love for the notification messages of love and support from your pet! Im not going to lie, its made me tear up occasionally.Im completely enamored by this app. If it were just a self care app I would just quit and forget, but having this cute little finch to take care of keeps me motivated to keep doing everything. I know it’s just a bunch of ones and zeroes but my brain sees a cute little finch and my instinct is to care for it as best I can. The app is really well designed, although I feel there are some things you shouldn’t have to pay in app purchases (although I have no example off the bat) but that’s ok. It’s really not a big problem. I’m so glad I stumbled across this app bc on days where I’m feeling really miserable (I’m going through a rough time) my friends will send me good vibes, or my finch will come back from an adventure and tell me a cute story about her day and it just makes me smile. This app is incredibly designed, kudos to the creator(s).This app has an extremely “cutesy” theme to it, which might not be for everybody. But, it also provides you with a lot of wisdom, and food for thought. As “dumb” as some of the little “activities” appear, they really do help you to focus on the things in your life that matter, and to let go of the things that don’t. I would especially recommend this app to anybody that is going through a chaotic time in life, and who doesn’t have a lot of family and friends to help. In at least some ways, this app replaces a kind, loving, person, with a listening ear, and an open heart. Again, the “cute” aesthetic might turn some people off, but, even for those people, I would say, try it, and see if it works for you - appearances don’t always tell the whole story!This has really been helpful to me. It at times has led me close to tears. Self care and self value has been next to impossible For me over the years-appallingly so. Up till recently have had tremendous self flagellating thought patterns. 
I’m finding this helps me reinforce positive self talk, step into gratitude and kindness. Calmly allows one to get into goal setting-even if it’s surviving a difficult day. 
 The program is truly ingenious, as it sort of has it own paths you follow through that move in and out of a tamogachi like playfulness with your character into various forms of meditation, reflection, goal setting etc. The guided breathing is nice as well. One can essentially weave intuitively through it at one’s own pace.  I’ve never felt once any sort of heavy vibes or pressure with the app-it’s just simply been uplifting and reinforcing. It also avoids cheesy-ness. Reminds me of the tastefulness of say Totoro-and all its charm and poetics. 

Can’t recommend this app enough if self care and positive self talk is challenging for oneself. As I said it’s quite comforting and a truly ease-full tool if one has any mental health, ptsd, addiction/recovery history. 

All the best to anyone out there.I’ve tried other self-care apps but so far this is the only one I can stick with. It’s simple, it’s cute, and it works. Setting goals and reaching them helps your baby finch grow. I’m saving the 5th star until a few bugs work out, which I’m sure they will. Great FB group for support also. Love it.

UPDATE  I knew I would be updating to 5 stars because I love using this app so much, but I’m doing it now because I keep stumbling across delightful little surprises in it — day to day history, including all the questions, not just the answers! — and each one makes me love it more. Also, I got a super-nice reply to my first review, asking me to explain “bugs” so they can fix them and I guess such a nice app had to be made by nice people. Thanks.You get to choose what color you want your pet to be and name it! You can make as many goals as you would like and check them off once your done. You can set reminders and customize your goals to whenever you want to do them and check them off when your done. Your pet gets energy when you check a goal off and you get gems to buy things for your pet or it’s house. Your pet also goes on adventures and once it’s done with an adventure it shares a story with like how it discovered something new and you get to choose between 2 choices how you want to respond! It makes me so motivated to do things and even has exercises, reflections, and other mental health things. It’s really cute, GET THE APP!Finch is a great app to get you motivated and happy! Your little animal is so cute and adorable!! She/He will let you pick some goals and you get to try and challenge yourself to do all of them by the end of the day!!

My generation had/has a whole different  way of communication and socializing. Even people that were open minded enough to accept people that were experiencing the social situation of being accepted for feeling as though they were a different gender still sounded as though they were riding the fence in whether they were supportive. I have not always been the best supporter but after my mental breakdown and meeting a transgender man and hearing his story and the pain he experienced “coming out “ I felt great compassion and was moved to be different after my experience. This app did a good job providing simplified explanation for pronouns for people.I genuinely love this app with my whole heart. My partner introduced me to it, and we share our little lives on Finch with eachother every other day..We love showing eachother our weekly reflections. Finch overall has helped us understand eachother more. Being able to vent and sad-write has also improved my mental health overall!! I don't feel like I need to bottle things up, it's so much better than just a journal or diary. This app is S O cute btw, the little birb who I named ""J"" is such an adorable concept!! I love being able to develop a story line and choose how J learns about certain topics. Also dressing them up and basically growing with them?? 5/5 app :^)I never thought a cartoon bird would help me manage my anxiety and depression, but here we are. Not only is this app super helpful and incredible, the developers are so active with us users on FB, for example, and are always taking our ideas and suggestions and improving the app to what we want/need it to be. In the history of ever, when has an app had actual caring humans constantly reaching out to improve things? Never. Amazing. I love them so much and my little finchy birb, Skittles, is growing beautifully and helping me learn so much about myself every single day. Keep it up guys! We need you now more than ever.I saw this app on someone else’s phone screen, and the bird was cute, so I looked it up and downloaded it. My finch’s name is Sprout and they are my best friend. I will do goals like washing my face or doing jumping jacks - both things I wouldn’t do on an everyday basis otherwise - just so Sprout can go on adventures. I love when my finch comes back at the end of the day with a little story. The notifications the app sends me saying things like “you’re doing great!” is one of my favorite features, especially on a bad day, it cheers me up. Thank you to the people who made this app. It is truly amazing.I give this app a 5 star review because it has realy helped me. It makes my day easier if i am having a hard time because i can always write about what has been on my mind or a funny story or what i am grateful for. It also helps with making positive habits like drinking more water, meditating, picking up the house, going on a walk, and so many more. I love how you can pick your characters gender as non-binary because i know that a lot of other apps dont have that feature. This app has really helped me be more positive and i would highly recommend it to anyone.I love this app. I’ve done it every day for nearly 2 weeks. I was struggling and under a lot of stress, and a week later I looked back over the history of my writings on this app and I was surprised to see how following the prompts I was able to clear my mind and focus on my beliefs again. It helped me ground myself on the here and now and stay present throughout my day, unlike normal time on my phone which is distracting. I’m amazed how well this set up works for me! It’s so encouraging, fun, motivating and truly useful. I’d recommend you give it a try! It might just pull you up :)I really really love this app. Originally I got it because I thought it was just going to be a cute little dress up game, but now I’m genuinely making steps to make myself better because of it. One of my favorite features is the story option to just get through the day, as honestly that is my goal most days. I have never found another self help app that has acknowledged this aspect of mental health. I made my fiancé download it and we love checking off our goals every day and sending our little birds to each other. I’m so grateful I downloaded it.So first of all let me tell my story, I have add and adhd but mostly add I can control my adhd but not my add anyways when I was little I was SOO energetic so my parents signed me up for track to get the energy out of me but my first day I fell asleep on the track and that was when I started to control it ( lol I feel like Elsa) I can’t have any coffee energy drink or too much candy or I’ll not be able to control it ( I don’t likecoffee  anyways)

Once I found finch it literally started making me feel more controlable. ( also love that u can make the finch 🏳️‍🌈 ✨💅👑)It’s a cute little bird that goes on adventures and when it’s done, it will tell you story and you would say goals and I’ll be so nice to set goals and do those goals and when you think about it you’re like OK this actually is helping this is like OK I can actually do this so it’s really fun and I really like it. Some people may not but I would give it like a five stars it’s really nice and I love it. It’s a cute little game. And it’s for kids to if they want to. It’s really nice it has quizzes like anxiety quizzes. It’s really cute the birds cute you can get him more birds so it’s really fun.",2,Battered but ResiliantKittychan9sssamanthOverlord14926TheRealCrouton13SuperMasterPlaya696969eskimo juniorOldeWomanTabarekALGthe gurl<3JLGraham46Boobsnoopdiddyboptate morgankailey heinenKrispy Kream KMishi1917off i eat cookisBayleeGregory!,"Surprisingly Affirming & Useful as of Day # 3Amazing!

I didn’t keep my subscription in August. I purchased a year subscription to only have a totally different version. It no longer offers the walking and running. It no longer offers the stretching challenge, the plank challenge, the leg challenge and other challenges I enjoyed. I see now they charge extra for these things. Why even charge to use the app if I will have to pay to do challenges as well. Under fitness There are only 6 different types of plans. They no longer separated easy, moderate, and hard workout from each other. I was so disappointed and feel as if I have wasted my money purchasing a full year’s subscription.  I use to love this app but not so much anymore. Also what is the difference between the premium version and the non premium? 
One more thing their should be a voice or a ding to let you know when it is time to change excises.Better me app was great, until the honeymoon is over. I did learned to do my intermittent fasting, and I love the app, but…Slow customer service. There’s no refund, they will charge you for not requested services fees. 

I did my annual renewal subscription this February, and in May they charged me the same amount again, I didn’t ordered any other service. And of course they use their “refund policy” shield, and offer other services or “challenges” instead of giving you your money back. A very abusive practice!

I regret recommending this app. Just lost my annual subscription, and the non requested new subscription (90$ aprox), because I do not trust them anymore. I fear they will charged me again in 2 months, and I will never receive a refund.While this does have a lot of information and the base program is good, I have had some problems with this app that were not resolved, I merely got apologies.
Not acceptable.  An apology is like a promise you make to someone to not repeat the same mistakes, clearly this app failed on that.
The challenge videos I received did not work for about a week straight.  First time I complained, then it just kept happening as though no one was paying any attention to their program. 
The last challenges I signed up for didn’t even show up and now as the challenge moves forward daily when I received nothing.
The base program is good, but do not do any challenges until they fix this.I would give 0 stars but am unable to. Was excited to start my journey to getting fit and healthy and got a week into the app, religiously doing my program each day and ended up locked out because I don’t want to pay for any challenges. Allows you into app but won’t let you access any tracking options or workouts or anything unless you pay to do one of their challenges. Total waste and scam saying it’s free - it’s only free to download. If you want to make any progress you’re stuck subscribing to their food/workout challenges - no choice given not to. 
10/10 would not recommend at this pointI signed up a couple of weeks ago and paid for three months and a meal plan. It locked me out all of a sudden three days ago and I have made two attempts at customer service and tried to reset my password MULTIPLE times and with no success. Everyone I try to reset it says it doesn’t recognize my email yet I’m still getting notifications on challenges I signed up for.  I wanted this to be good but reading these similar reviews makes quickly regret my decision now. Canceling, not recommending and would greatly appreciate a refund.I loved the 30-day Pilates challenge offered when I purchased the app, but life interrupted and I was unable to finish. I didn’t get back to it until I was beyond the first month discount and paying the full monthly price, but that feature was removed, and in its place are a bunch of other challenges which are all behind yet another paywall. In the end, you get very little for your monthly subscription price. When I tried reaching out to customer support, I got auto messages saying someone would contact me within 24hrs, but no one ever does. Very disappointed in this app. 👎I was looking for an app that could do it all, and this is not it. I am extremely disappointed. 

Logging meals is impossible because of the entry methods, scanning a barcode is not useful because 90% of the scans I’ve done have not been there and I have to add them. If the barcodes were there, the information in them is highly inaccurate. 

Exercises, even if you select the home version of exercises you have to own your own gym of equipment to do them.  The walking or movement exercises don’t work with Apple Watch even though you grant access to your movement information. You have to keep your phone in your pocket and can’t view your progress. 

Meal Plans are laid out nicely but they are very odd items that I would never eat.  

Anything extra like challenges cost way more than I paid for the app. 

Major Disappointment for me.You have to pay extra to participate in challenges. The recipes are convoluted and many times not accurate.  You can’t save recipes to refer back to, but there really aren’t many you would want to try again.  You can’t log your workout if you don’t do the generic workout selected for you in the app.  Overall a very disappointing app and I’ve already moved on to another app after just two weeks.  Wish both my wife and I could get our money back.When you sign up for a free trial it sounds simple then they offer a bunch of challenges you can join and one would assume they’re also part of the trial. Wrong, they’re one time purchases. I requested a refund during the trial period without accessing them and no response from the BetterMe team. You would also think that if you purchased these challenges you would be able to access them, but no, you have to subscribe to their monthly plan. What a ripoff!Thought I would try this for a few weeks so I just purchased this morning.  Did the exercises but confusing.  It said 4 minutes but ended up being 11 which I’m fine with 11 but why did it say 4?  Then sometimes it would automatically switch to the next exercise but sometimes not and I would need to click on the arrow. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Then as I am perusing through the app - interested in clean eating and no sugar challenges I see I have to pay more money. What?!   I want my money back.  Bait and switch.  Frustrating!!No clear summary of what they call your “plan” so you have no real overview.  This app is expensive and there are constant pop ups trying to get you to spend even more money on challenges, etc.  I contacted their customer service right away to let them know that this app was not what I expected and wouldn’t work for me and requesting a refund but they did not even listen sending me an email with “tips” as if I am some sort of idiot.  Find yourself a better option and good luck with your personal journey.If I could give it no stars I would have. I have been trying to get a refund from day one, never was able to use, what I purchased did net exist on there app”sofa yoga” does not appear in their challenges or work- out lists. After three days of going back and forth the gave me 50% refund I never used it.

When it first came out the exercises were not as detailed as they are now and I was impressed with the updates they made until the most recent update. I started using the app faithfully (with a faithful monthly subscription) since March but since the last update, last week I believe, every time I open the app their challenges pop up and I have to click on joining one just to be able to get to the home screen. I refuse to pay an extra $10-30 for a challenge when the app barely allows me to enter my meals daily because elf the limited food selection. I shouldn’t have to go through the challenges just to get to the home page to perform my workout, log my weight for the week, or log my water for the hour.

Update: I agree with other reviewers, this app is a scam! It’s not worth the $9.99/month. The calorie counter section does not include many options the barcode scanner does not pick up barcodes leaving you to enter them on your own. It does not let you go back and fix previous day entries (i.e., water intake from the previous day), if you do a different workout aside from the one assigned to you in the app or in a different app it does not count towards your progress for the day. It is pt worth it.For the cost of using this program it could be set up much better.  The food tracker part is seriously lacking.  I can not even accurately use it.  So I’m paying monthly to use the app, but I have to use a completely different app to accurately track food which is a hassle.  The food can only be recorded in ounces.  If I am eating a cheese stick on the go, I have no idea how many ounces it is. If you scan it on the app it may show up as a kraft Colby cheese stick, but you still can only document it in ounces.  You can’t just log one cheese stick with the correct nutrients. Several items I have used are not in the database.  If you have to manually enter the item, you can only enter the calories.  When watching carbs, proteins, and fats, only being able to record calories is not efficient.  All the food that is not in the database for this app are in the database on other apps with accurate measurements.  Any challenges you want to do have to be paid for on top of the regular cost.  The program is not that well set up to account for the cost of using it.  There are much better apps available that are significantly cheaper.I’m torn between at 2 or 3 star rating. I purchased 3 months worth of this app and would not recommend paying for it. The first week I used the app I liked it a lot but as I realized some of my expectations of myself did not fit with what I was actually capable of doing I found I was not able to adjust my plan. I could edit my profile but my plan stayed the same and this discouraged my desire to continue using the app and keeping up with streaks. 
I also found it frustrating that i paid to use the app and then also was expected to pay to participate in challenges. 
I loved the menu and diversity of meals suggested but the pictures don’t match the recipe and the recipes are so basic that they were hard to figure out exact how to cook something. Also, once again, I was unable to change the way it had set up my plan so that it fit what I actually needed. I also was unable to save or find meals that I had made and wanted to make a second time.
I like the idea of the app but it definitely needs some work.The App costs 9.99 USD per week and interesting add-one like meal plans or challenges cost extra. The basic (subscription) App is pretty basic, a plan for building up your daily step number. You can also log water and calories but even the free version of My Fitness Pal is more convenient for these  features and has the advantage of linking with Garmin, Fitbit, or other fitness gadgets and Apps. Great free meal plans are available from other sources. The idea of these services out of one App is good but not yet well enough realized in my opinion, especially considering the steep price tag.

I am impressed with Better Me customer service. They answered promptly to my emails and will refund the amount in line with their purchase terms. I may check back occasionally to see how the app is developing. A free 1 month trial (or even only 1 week) would be a helpful feature.This app has some usefulness which is why I gave it a two.  The food logging is limited so it’s useful for trends but don’t expect a completely accurate calorie count.

The reminders to log your food and workout are helpful.

If you do the trial subscription you will receive several pop-ups with deals for different subscription levels.  I took one of these deals and signed up for the annual subscription.  What they don’t tell you is that you have to manually cancel the trial subscription (which doesn’t show up anywhere on your Apple subscriptions) or you will continue to be charged.  I signed up for an annual subscription and then was charged for two separate (concurrent) quarterly subscriptions.  I didn’t notice when it happened the first time but contacted customer service when the 2nd quarterly charge appeared.  They will not refund the concurrent subscription.  I am one person and have the app on one device - why do I need two subscriptions.  In the end, the “deal” I got for a $20 annual subscription ended up costing me $80.  😡

On top of that you are constantly bombarded with pop-ups for additional paid challenges.  I like the idea of challenges but not when they are popping up as ads for additional purchases every time I open the app.I found this app to be rather frustrating for the most part. It has very little direction and the workouts themselves are not very impactful. The most aggravating aspect are the various “challenges” that you can sign up for. You paid for a service and then have to continually pay for different, short challenges. I purchased 2 in error and notified customer service and it was literally tooth and nail to get a refund and even then, it was only a partial one. We went back and forth over several messages with my messages won’t being heard. 
I didn’t try the food portion so no review on that.I wanted to love this app so badly.  On the surface, it seemed to have it all but then you had to maneuver your way through it on a daily basis.  It is way too cumbersome!  

The exercise videos are a plus. They are fairly easy to follow but the challenges are extra money so that is a definite turn off. 

The logging of foods is ridiculous. The options are too many with differing values attached to them.  When logging weights in pounds, it is in whole numbers.  No allowing for tenths of a pound. So a loss of .8# will not register as a loss.  It made no sense to keep a separate log in my note app.  I emailed customer service-crickets.  Also, there was no reminder about the free trial ending. 

So, I’m going to use Lose It for their ease of logging foods and weights.   I’m thankful I only wasted  $10.   Lesson learned!!!",0,"Like the App, Hate the Update & SCAM!Not worth the money you have to payThe more I use it the less I like itNot enough value for moneyBuyer Beware!Potential but a Long Way to GoJust NOT for me",OfficialNerdsunflower652Songifjoy89KexinFCyndie FAngie100282djc.55,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1318,has_challenges,33

Had the free version for a while so said why not. The workouts are tailored to your goals which is rlly a nice touch and different than any other app I have used. They get points for that.
But! And it’s a big BUT. After purchasing there’s not really anything added from the free version aside from simple log/tracking, most of which it just grabs from the iPhones health app anyway. You get these ads for extra “challenges” that are like 30-60$, not included. The tracker doesn’t let you log your own work outs which you will need to do some Bc theirs feels like it misses a few things. It tends to force quit when doing the outdoor walk/running work outs. The meal logging also makes you do some guess work as to the weight of any item you eat so it’s not so accurate.. That being said, You will end up using several other apps to fill in where this one fails. They do have a great IG account with plenty of challenges and food/diet recommendations. They have a support person on your account you can reach out to as well which is nice. But again, There’s no reason to spend your money here, the price is kind of outrageous for an app considering how much better the competition is in this space.The app is not easy to deal with
Scan function does not come up with serving size even when it does recognize product. Took me a bit to figure out I could adjust ounces but since I do not weigh my food I still have to play with it to get the right amount of cal. It doesn’t save all my previous entries ,just the day before and as I eat a lot of the same things it would be easier if it came up so I could just hit it again. Recipes r ok but have a lot of stuff that I just don’t see a normal household having in their fridge. Reminders r good exercises are fine. I wish there was a place to keep track of daily blood pressure and sugar so I could compare to food and water intake. Some of it is just getting used to the Ap and with time I may find it easier. Even though u pay for the ap. Challenges cost more(not good)I bought this app a year ago and I do like the extra features, but if we’re being honest… it’s really not that much extra you’re getting. There’s a lot on this app that you still have to pay more for and I think that’s ridiculous, because you’re already paying for a subscription so why do you have to pay more for challenges etc? Doesn’t make sense. I will never subscribe to this app again.I like where the app is going, but it is clunky! Everything is in ounces. I’m sorry but I’m not going to put a tablespoon of coffee creamer on a scale. A lot of the features of this app are free on other apps. It’s essentially a platform to upsell you on challenges. Again, free on many other apps. If you’re going to pay a subscription (which I do for other apps), it should be providing you at least the basics.I do love the concept, platform and meal tracker, BUT it’s “buggy.” I asked for workout reminders certain days of the week and then the app assigns those days as “rest days.” How does that make sense? 

Also it offers you to PAY for challenges.... no money prizes just pay $10 to join the sugar free challenge. What blows my mind is that the app claims 4K people signed up for this. Uhhh you like this idea then just don’t consume sugar and keep your $10. 🤷‍♀️

There’s no way to log your own workouts if you don’t do the specific app workout. The weight tracker doesn’t “move” which for most who have a goal of weight loss... to see that line graph with a downward slope is super motivating. 

So again I WANT to love this app and hope that the developers will fine tune a few things.The meal planning works if you don’t have dietary restrictions. The work outs are effective. The notifications to remind you to drink water, eat, and work out are effective. They nickel and dime you to death. You must pay a monthly subscription, then pay for ‘challenges’ within the app. I won’t be renewing. There are plenty of other apps just like this one with more features and better pricing.",0,Not worth the $Ok appDo not buy this app… there’s no pointCancelled it after the first dayI WANT to love itAlright...pricey compared to other apps just like it,mrstealyomemepds56Sav Catnik343434seenthisroadashleia,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,779,has_challenges,33

With that being said, there are some improvements that could be made. 
  
  There should be a scheduler for the fasting section. We should be able to pick a time to automatically start our fast and set it for the amount of hours that we fast, in my case 16 hours. Currently, you have to go into the app to start and stop your fast and that’s not always convenient. There are times I don’t have my phone with me and I have to wait until the next day to reset everything. Having that option on Apple Watch would help as well. 
  
  Setting and choosing which notifications we want to receive is also something the developers should consider. I stated in my profile that I fast only eating lunch, dinner and a snack. It’s very annoying to get breakfast reminder notifications everyday!

  On the positive side, I love the exercises and some of the challenges. Overall, it’s a good app, but if the developers would listen and implement some of the changes their customers are suggesting, it would be a great app.This app has everything included, which is admittedly very nice. You can track your water and food intake, find exercises and challenges, and track your weight. 
Unfortunately the calorie counting is very inconsistent and not very user-friendly. You might search a food and find several different calorie amounts. Other apps do this much better, standardizing the caloric count for a specific food and allowing you to update your portions. I currently don’t track calories only because it is really cumbersome. I wish this feature of the app was better. 
The challenge workouts can be glitchy as well, which is annoying but not a dealbreaker.",0,Some improvements neededDecent Health App,LibraNiNiLaurganic,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,295,has_challenges,33

I love everything this app has to offer. It is extremely easy to use, never lags or crashes, as some of the apps that I used. The workouts are not tiring, yet effective. They also take not that much time, but you can literally feel how your muscles get stronger. You can also try various challenges, which spices up the routine and keeps it interested. It is a perfect option for you if you don’t like gyms but want to melt some excess fat. I also want to mention the diet plan, because that was the thing that caught my interest and made me download it in the first place. So, your meal plan is completely customized, I believe it is a once-in-a-lifetime finding for vegans, cause I’ve heard that it is rarely that apps offer you a decent vegan meal plan. Anyway, you won’t regret downloading this app for sure!I love this app! it provides a variety of workouts & challenges to meet individual need/ interest.  Short workouts for those of us whose lifestyle don’t grant us the freedom of hourly workouts multiple times a week. Although the workouts are short you definitely feel the burn. Most importantly it’s an app that doesn’t break the bank!I haven't worked out in years, Burt out from other demands in life. Put on 60 pounds in the last year. I thought this will be easier to get me stated. This program challenges me and gets my day started. It's hard work I can tell it's working: I'm sore so and glad I chose beginner lol! It's a great low stress way to get going again on your health journey IMHO.I originally downloaded this app for my self, but the rest the girls in my family wanted to get in the action! I have found amazing results! They have amazing food choices,and workouts, including daily challenges. I can’t believe how this has changed me.

When you start a workout set, you can enable or disable the warm-up/cool-down options. All workouts are different. They are aimed at different fitness levels and intensity. If you want to try more challenging workouts, feel free to do so, as the app offers you a great variety of exercises to choose from. If any voice guidance does not correspond to a video, that might be a temporary glitch. So, to understand the situation better, we are always grateful for additional details. If you don\'t like any voice prompts or timers, you can just disable them and turn on your own music. We believe it will make your workout routine funnier and more pleasant. While you work out, exercises for particular body zones should interchange, and workouts need to alternate. With variations and by changing position, you can target different muscles and keep your training interesting. If the pace is too fast for you, you can tap on the video while working out and select Pause ""||"" to stop it. It will give you as much time for a break as needed.

1. No proper warmup before exercises, perhaps because the entire workout feels like a warmup - not challenging at all

2. Voice guidance doesn’t always match to what the trainer is showing :)
Clearly nobody bothered to double check such a basic thing.  

3. Trainers are different in the same workout, which I personally don’t like 

4. The workout consists of a ton of short clips of 30 seconds or so of different exercises complied together with different trainers and different rooms they are in, which is off putting in my opinion 

5. Music and clicking is simply annoying + voice sounds robotic 

6. Sometimes it takes more time to go from one position to another than the duration of the whole exercise 

7. No logical timeline of exercises - some are done standing, then sitting, I would prefer to have all standing then all sitting exercises so it’s not a waste of time to keep adjusting from one to the other 

The list can go on and on, in summary - everything about the app is unappealing and I won’t use it anymore, it’s neither a relaxing nor energizing experience, simply waste of time.This app does not seem to be fully developed. It does not work properly. Meals cannot be edited. Today, I had a modern market curry salmon bowl. It is a choice on the app so I was initially delighted. However, after I chose it, it didn’t have the specs accounted for so it didn’t credit me any protein. There is no way for me to add the protein points. Also, I did not eat the entire bowl but there is no way to say that I had 2/3 of it, and no way to edit my calorie intake. After that, I tried to do the workouts. The videos simply do not work. I was stuck waiting for each to get going and wasn’t able to clock out or ahead.I bought this app a few months back and loved it. Then with the latest updates. The app has removed about 2/3 of the works you could do if you didn’t wanna do you plan work out. The messed up thing is. They split this app into multiple apps so you pay for those apps too. Terrible money grab move. On top of that even if you pay for a year you don’t get the benefits that used to be in the app.  I paid 40 bucks and still deleted my sub. Get the adidas training and running app.  100% better. 1 it’s free and after three days your progress doesn’t reset. 2 it allows you to win points for training that goes to buying new shoes.",0,Would not recommendApp is horribleDon’t buy,Lalala360KweightsDijonpl09,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,483,has_points,5

Had the free version for a while so said why not. The workouts are tailored to your goals which is rlly a nice touch and different than any other app I have used. They get points for that.
But! And it’s a big BUT. After purchasing there’s not really anything added from the free version aside from simple log/tracking, most of which it just grabs from the iPhones health app anyway. You get these ads for extra “challenges” that are like 30-60$, not included. The tracker doesn’t let you log your own work outs which you will need to do some Bc theirs feels like it misses a few things. It tends to force quit when doing the outdoor walk/running work outs. The meal logging also makes you do some guess work as to the weight of any item you eat so it’s not so accurate.. That being said, You will end up using several other apps to fill in where this one fails. They do have a great IG account with plenty of challenges and food/diet recommendations. They have a support person on your account you can reach out to as well which is nice.

There is no free version. I had to start a dispute to cancel my membership. There is no free trial. Everything is an upgrade or extra fee. No modifications for those of us with injuries (although specified) You cannot tailor it for “you” and the workouts are unlocked daily, so you have to pay for tomorrow’s- if you can’t do it due to physical limitations that day was a waste. The diets are chosen by 4 groups, no modifications, like their workouts. I asked for a refund, they offered me two months. My suggestion is to use one of the other free apps and not get trapped here. I will say that their customer service took fantastic business communication classes and can say, “we are sorry you feel this way… we encourage you… and it’s our goal…. Not to mention the famous, “thank you for your feedback, we strive to improve and value our customers and their experiences” but they don’t because as you read the reviews, not one refund was issued, not one problem was resolved. It was only “sorry.” I’ll leave this here- it was a great idea that needs a ton of improvement.1 star is too generous. Downloaded this app as it seemed very engaging. Used its workout guide maybe twice and lost interest. Big deal they notify you to drink water. Many other apps do that for free. Not worth the money so I cancelled it after paying for the quarter. My loss. Then they billed me again. Of course I didn’t sceeenshot my original cancelation but I do remember adding my feedback that they requested on why I cancelled stating it was too expensive. So I re-cancel and click on stop auto payment. Then I contact their un-customer service and am provided with the generic response of their TOC and that they show I canceled today. Yeah I get I had to re cancel to make sure you stop stealing my money and that I know I cancelled so I should be refunded. But so they got me again. $118 wasted. Total scam. Be sure to “manually” cancel in their settings page if you can find it. Beware if they steal your money you can’t trust them with your data so steer clear.Workouts as standalone quick workouts are decent but no app or account support (or even replies) hence this review. Workout “plans” are a joke. One day I was doing knee pushups for 8 reps. The next I was doing 6 minutes of continuous pull-ups. I don’t know if any human can do 6 minutes of consecutive pulls ups. I paid for a 12 week “personalized” program out of curiosity which was my own mistake. I wasn’t expecting a coach to show up at my doorstep but it’s obvious they just give everyone pretty much the exact same thing no matter how you answer their little quiz. 

Turns out the personalized 12 week program was just one of those “28 day calisthenics” plans. Once you do 28 days, that’s it lol the remaining 8 weeks, you have the option to repeat the exact same 28 workouts. No progression or incremental increases. 

The app is also device dependent, not account.  So if you’re on day 8 on your iPad, then you travel and try to use your phone the next day for day 9, you can’t do that. This wouldn’t be an issue but the workouts are locked 1 per day and you have to do them in order. That UX is a real head scratcher.. 

So as a free app to pick ad hoc random workouts, sure it’s ok.Bought a 1 time plan from this company and used it here and there. Not a bad program cause it shows the workout in time but just didn’t go any further with it. Well I get charged $50 then later on! When I go to say I didn’t purchase any new program they say it auto signs you up for renewals after your first time period is over. When I said I didn’t want to do that they said they wouldn’t refund me because it was supposedly stated when I signed up (who reads the fine print 🙄) anyways be careful because if you don’t want to continuously be charged after getting a discounted one time purchase you will not get any money back or be treated with care. They just want as much as your money as possible.I wish I could leave it negative stars ! 
This is the worst app I have ever used ! It takes days for customer service to respond in any capacity .. I have had the app for almost a year and have actually gotten to use it about 4 times . I am not sure if their system is continuously hacked or what the deal is, but I have had to password reset several times and each time the reset email says that my email address is incorrect which it is not, so customer service then needs to be contacted which takes weeks to straighten anything out with them ! I would not recommend this app to anyone !UPDATE: My review literally says I have a torn rotator cuff and I would like there to be modification options for injuries and your response literally said “ …Still, it's hard for us and other users to understand what stands behind your negative feedback. And we would appreciate sharing further details of what could have caused an unpleasant experience.”  My two star review just dropped to one due to your lack of personalization and what seems to be an automatic response.

I have a torn rotator cuff and it would be nice if there were options so I can avoid the plank like exercises.This app would be wonderful, if you were trying to lose weight. However, for someone who’s trying to become stronger than overcoming an eating disorder this app is horrible. 
I specifically but that I was trying to get healthier and build muscles. I’m at a healthy weight and just trying to be more active. Regardless of that, I continuously got notification after notification about losing weight. It seems as that’s the whole purpose of the app. Which is totally fine, just NOT what I was looking for, or expecting.Aggressive sales - Continuously want to sell additional programs.  I signed up for one cost, the renewal month was an additional $9.00!  Subscriptions are AUTOMATICALLY renewed.  That is thievery and not a positive business practice for me, the consumer.  I decide when a product is worthy of renewal.  

Not easy to navigate - Again, additional sales pitches for every icon.  Not user friendly at all!   I am not lazy, I am not inept, I am professional and do not have time to waste in maneuvering the app without any specific direction. Literally, a waste of time and money!I decided to try this app due to the meal planning. However, the functionality is basic at best. The most input you can make is a quiz asking what foods you eat or don’t eat, then the offered meal plans completely ignore this input!!  This would be a minor inconvenience except that there is no way to edit the foods in the actual meal plans, or anyway to edit anything at all. So the meal planning is completely useless. This app has a ton of potential, but is horribly executed and seems the developers respond to purchasers feedback, but don’t ACTUALLY make any changes. Very disappointed.I signed up months ago and didn't realize I had signed up for a continuous subscription. When reaching out to customer support I was met with condescending remarks. Some guy named “Joey” basically making me feel stupid for not realizing I had a subscription with them. They won’t give me a refund but want to offer me another 3 months free for an app I don’t even use. With an added tag of how I “shouldn’t” be charged again after the 3 free months. I’ve never had a more unprofessional customer service experience.I tried this app a year or so ago. The videos weren’t user friendly- I didn’t have time to switch positions during workouts. I reached out to them today with questions and received an automatic reply, they received my email but not that someone would respond, that I could look at Help Center sections. Also the two buttons to select were All good and Need help. Both buttons opened another page with the message “Thank you for the feedback.” Don’t waste your time or money.Despite repeated feedback given that certain types of workouts are not physically possible for me they keep being given as part of the workout. This is demotivating and ruins the whole point of the process. Either be honest that you don’t actually take feedback or actually pay attention to it. Include an option where people can check off what they can’t do so the system can recognize to remove it vs only typing in descriptionsDownloaded the app thinking it would be a reasonable tracking method and the features seem nice. Didn’t even get to look at it more than once until I noticed 2 charges on my account. It’s a weekly subscription on top of additional costs to even get a plan made for you! The subscription is hidden outside of the app and very difficult to track down the cancellation options, I would have deleted the app if I hadn’t forgotten about it and still been charged continuously!",0,Skip itScam App Stat ClearBorderline scamWatch Out for the Fine Print!This app is terribleModifications would be niceTriggering for Someone Recovering from an Eating DisorderPushy in Sales & Not Easy to NavigateNot as advertisedDon’t waste time or moneyScam and no customer supportFeedback is a scamWeekly charges plus additional costs,imsupersteph🌟💗🌟10windowsHisGirl4Evr......78Modifications??ajaxattack19R&AEtmikeFrogerz1873KtsnjKayleeWinchKita-mom,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,13,0,1,0,0,0,1604,has_feedback,21

I’m in moderately good shape and was given a 28 day workout plan designed for a geriatric age demographic with little too no muscle tone. Despite updating my profile. Taking the fitness tests in the app, and giving lots of workout feedback that these weren’t hard enough, I couldn’t update my plan. It’s not that I couldn’t navigate through to find harder workout options, but that defeats the point of the app. I downloaded it to have a quick access to a customized, ready to go daily workout plan. Big miss. I also tried asking via the in app help and the online help and couldn’t even get a response. Unsubscribing.Purchased the plan for wall Pilates and was started off with sessions that might be a challenge for a wheel chair bound nursing home resident.  Gave the feedback that it was too easy but the app did not adjust the difficulty.  Sent a letter to support and didn’t receive a response.  Also purchased coaching and when I tried to sign up for a coach it wanted to charge me again.  The psychology articles were interesting- that is where they got some points.  I was basically scammed about 40 dollars.I signed up for this app for the wall pilates program. I had to put in my info (age,etc). I’m 70, but have worked out since my 20’s.  I did the first 6 wall pilates programs, but was bored out of my mind. I did go on to do workouts after (ab burner, etc), but these were too easy as well. It asked for my feedback & said my program would be adjusted accordingly. I never heard anything else.  For me, a total waste of money. If one is a newbie to workouts, it might work.The somatic exercises is why I signed up for this app, and they truly have helped me. However, I signed up for BetterMe health and the app credit attempted to charge me with BetterMe women, BetterMe fasting, and BetterMe. Though I love the app and how much the exercises have helped, it’s not worth the headache to have my virtual card continuously charged and virtual card number having to be cancelled due to this activity.",0,Tries but doesn’t succeedDisappointing and a rip offDoesn’t work for meI really wanted to live this app,Danipalmer23bmbow123MassdanePatty8815,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,389,has_feedback,21

It helps to hear and follow along without having to stare at the phone for what’s next and when to transition; however, there are a lot of errors. The app should allow for quick feedback by workout because it’s weird when you are doing a completely different exercise based on audio than is demonstrated on video, or you do the same exercise multiple times on the right as instructed thinking you’ll come back to left and never do, etc.  Also I purchased the 30-day toned tummy challenge for $4.99…has no narration that explains the move and no transition warning, so unless you are staring at the phone, you cannot follow along with ease.  Haven’t seen enough at home fitness that caters to the use of just hand weights. Many at home workouts refer to equipment needed like machines (or two) in a gym. Have to click on each workout to see what I can do with the equipment I have at home.  I tried to use it for food tracking but felt like other apps had better functionality.  Also responsiveness to questions is the worst I’ve seen. Then when they finally respond, you’ve moved on to something else. At this point, I could use great workouts and device connectivity to other popular apps.Where are used the app to schedule workouts and put it on a family shared calendar. But it did not put it on my person. So I got a message from my sister Who lives in another state, Asking me what it was. but when I look on my calendar, it’s not there at all. So there’s some kind of glitch to be worked out with the Calendar scheduling aspect of the app. I’ve only used it one time so I don’t have any other feedback right now.I am not good with working with these things, my phone is smarter than me and I don’t know what I’m doing so you can’t really use my Feedback.

I work extra 20 hours or even more every week, it was really difficult to fit a full-blown training session into my daily schedule. It became the least important priority, and I regularly skipped training instead of regularly exercising. This app was a game-changer for me. There is no way I don’t have 15 minutes to train every morning. Plus, the workouts continuously change so I don’t get bored. I usually like to go at my own pace, and it seems to me that the system in the app motivates you to push harder, but it is not a problem at all. I measure my changes each week, and I can say that I got much leaner than I was a month ago! It is actually much easier to extend your sessions once you get used to the short ones. I think my friends don’t want to hear me talking about this app any more as I do so much, but it really is that good. Try this app, you will be surprised how easily it fits into your routine!

Nothing else was useful to me. Any additional workouts were pay only to access. 
I didn’t use it for the past few weeks due to crazy work schedule and yesterday I was hit with a $50 charge for subscription fee. No warning at all my trial was ending. A simple email received after they already took my money was ridiculous. And heaven forbid you actually want customer service to give a crap. They have been fighting to keep my money even though it was only hours after they took it that I tried to cancel the service. They offered to give me six months free then offered me half my money back! I want all my money back and I don’t want their service if this is how they treat people! Go read comments on their social media! I wish I had read it before I tried their app. Sleazy business practices! I’m going to keep raising awareness about this issue until they give my money back! Shame on you guys for doing this to people! We’re all trying to better our health and your just stressing us out!I was scrolling on social media and I came across an ad for this. It made it seem like you can do all of this on your own terms and log on your own time. I had paid for one month. When I finally had time that week I went to the app and I was forced to go to a chat with a private trainer.. I wouldn’t mind if it was just a chat you had whenever you had questions or they occasionally checked in on you, but for my experience, I had to go through the chat first. Once I had dealt with that, I had to log what I ate before I could go to the workouts. I hadn’t eaten much and from what I remember didn’t have much to log. By the time I dealt with that (along with multitasking other things) I didn’t have time for it. This happened a few times. I just decided it wasn’t worth it so I canceled my subscription and got rid of the app. Guess they remembered my card cause I got charged for another monthly subscription and I can’t log in on the app. So if you’re like me and you have no time, and don’t want to have to talk to a trainer before the workouts then don’t get it. Y’all do you though. This is just my experienceI joined better me based on an ad on social media showing a 28 day wall Pilates challenge. App on sale, money back satisfaction guaranteed. Once the app was downloaded I was participating in a 28 day summer body challenge. I reached out to customer service explaining the mistake. I did get a response that my program has been adjusted. When I logged back in I was participating in a Wall Pilates for seniors program. So I reached out again. NO RESPONSE. Tried again a few days later. NO RESPONSE. Sent a separate complaint that I’m not getting any response. NO RESPONSE! I canceled the subscription immediately and requested my money back. And shockingly I have received NO RESPONSE!!I wasn’t even able to try out the app due to a glitch of some sort. After entering my weight/height/etc., I received an error message requesting me to check my internet connection. All apps on my phone worked, so I proceeded to restart the app, restart my phone, and delete and re-download the app. Nothing worked, I received the same error message every time. There is no FAQ or easy to access team to reach out to in order to help fix this issue. I actually had to dig around a bit to find the app help team to contact.
*Update*
No response via email. After app update, the same problem persists. For an app that collects money weekly, I would expect better.I loved the three day trial. But that was it! I decided to go ahead and pay the $10 to try the rest of the month and it keeps giving me a message saying ""lost connection"" when all of my other apps work perfectly fine. The day that I start giving them my money the app crashes. Go figure.

I did figure out how to unsubscribe (no thanks to the directions they give) 
** you will have to go under 'settings' >>'iTunes and app store' and click on your Apple ID. There you can manage your subscriptions and get rid of it forever!!!!!Ok, I was EXTREMELY excited about the app when I downloaded it only two days ago. I completed my first workout yesterday and it was fantastic. I go in today to complete day two and I keep getting the Lost Connection error and it will not open one program, as this constantly keeps popping up. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my WiFi nor my cellular data and all of my apps are functioning properly, excite this one. I am very disappointed and now very happy that I did not purchase the program.The subscription selection screen is grossly misleading on this app. They tell you you can pay $2.75 weekly or $29 monthly, so I selected the weekly option. However, they make is grotesquely unclear that they are going to, in fact, bill you $119 in one lump sum. I contacted the developer twice via the “contact us” (LOL) page on their website AND I sent them a DM on their social media pages requesting a refund and  I GOT ZERO RESPONSE. This subscription selection method is broken and a scam looking to rip people off. (PLUS YOU CAN FIND ALL THESE WORKOUTS FOR FREE ONLINE.

I’ve received this response a month after I bought this. Thank you for confirming why I’m not subscribing for your app again.

WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR APP?!?! I can’t get past day 4 because it’s says no network connection? I had to reinstall twice and start over twice and all three times I can’t even through a week of workouts? I paid money for an app to not work?I signed up for the free trial before I invest that kind of money. The workout screen said I had no internet connection, even though I did. The food page said to make an individual profile it took me to the profile page where I had already filled out my profile. It wouldn’t let me save my profile other than to connect to my Facebook which it also said it couldn’t connect to. I’m glad I didn’t spend the money upfront. Wasted so much time trying to get it to work.BEWARE.  Even if you cancel the subscription in apple, they continue charging your credit card.  Additionally, customer service completely ignores you.  Having to cancel credit card to get rid of these guys.  Apple, you should do something about this app!!

There is a coach that chat with you but their automated. There’s no connection with anyone there. I’ve asked for a refund however they have been nonresponsive I did follow through with everything I needed to do within the program. Because I truly truly believed in the app. However, fasting requires a little bit more information. I should’ve done my research, so yes, that is my fault. However, now they are not standing up to their promise of refunding you if things did not work. I hate leaving negative reviews because in reality you don’t know who’s telling the truth or not. But I have the proof and I have receipts. I will post this on social media. With the receipts, the emails and the interaction that I’ve had with the coach. And allow everyone to be the judge. I have not received a response yet. Very sad and disappointBeing a movement teacher I’m always looking for new ways to continue my own training and education. I like the idea of this app, but 1. I am distracted by the looping jumps in the videos (not sure why they couldn’t video for the whole 30 secs). 2. The overlaid music tempo does not match the movements.( I want to feel motivated by the music and able to match the model’s pace.) 3. Some of the directions do not match the movements being shown. (“Move your arms as if jogging”, but the model’s arms are still.) 4. The model is facing the camera, but they do not mirror the verbal instructions. (So when she goes left it’s to your right.) 4. The video directions leave out any tips for how to remain safe, or have proper alignment. I fear someone is going to get injured. (You may find some in the written directions, but they are not thorough, nor always correct, from what I’ve learned elsewhere.) 4. There’s no connection of breath to your movements in the videos.So many great things all in one place - love the concept.
My current focus is tracking calories. It’s kind of a mess. I could handle the annoying redundancy of the different options, for a bit. Then noticed that my calories were different each time I logged in, something was resetting my calories on food already entered. So tedious. 
Additionally. I bought it for the wall Pilates work out that were advertised on social media…only to find out there were very few actual workouts of that kind. A little bummed.Decided to give this a try based on social media ads (the ones that said “my friend decided to cancel her gym membership and do this instead”). 

Don’t cancel your gym membership. Haha. The program wants you to be active enough to burn 790 calories a day but their workouts only burn like 40-60 calories. So this is not something you do instead of the gym. You still need the gym. 

I was looking simply to change up my workout routine, but this was not for me. I only lasted a few days because the workouts felt more like just stretching and not working out at all. 

Ok app if you’re looking for somewhere to track activities, food, water, etc but not as a workout plan. If I’m unlocking workouts daily, they should cover my full calorie burning goal for the day (or at least way more than 1/10 of it!).I am an active person and was until recently when i started to have knee problems. You take a quiz so they should have a pretty clear idea of your category. There is even tab to check for knee problems but in all the wall yoga and other exercises there is NO modification for bad knees. This app may be good for an inactive person looking for a regiment but not someone that is active. I was once again reminded not to believe the hype from social media and get taken $.I feel like this would be a great app just by looking at the overviews and that I would really

The “Join the Challenge” section of the app is working fine (of course) but MEALS and MY PLAN are not loading at all. 

**UPDATE**
I found the issue that was making parts of the app freeze. I logged out and logged back in and it worked fine. A few hours later, same issue, I logged out and logged back in and it worked again. Just want you guys to know that you may want to fix that bug! I’d also like to suggest somehow being able to track body movement via your phones camera in order to track daily steps while using a treadmill for your workouts.This app is great. It shows you the workouts . It tells you exactly what to do and times you doing it. You can share with your friends or on social media ... all great! Except when I got to about day 26 ... I do the workout, complete it. It records it ... then the app shuts down.. when I reopen... same thing. So I can’t unlock the next day because it’s showing I haven’t completed the previous... This app was my personal trainer and now I’m bummed and will be canceling my subscription because there’s no point if it can’t get past this... very disappointed.I was really excited to work out tonight. Nothing is loading. When it finally does, it keeps asking me to put in my info and make a new profile. Lots of glitching going on tonight. It even told me that I lost connection.

I think they’ve been reading my mind when it comes to “excuses” for not working out. Looking forward to more. 

I’ve been very pleasantly surprised by all the content, and the support has been amazing. I expected a one-style-of-workout deal, but there’s a wide variety of workouts, from HIIT to dancing in high heels. All of the moves are well-explained and a workout is usually enough to feel energized that I’ve done something, but not so tough it leaves me in a puddle on the floor. There are a few tweaks that need to made, but BetterMe seems to be working on scaling up pretty quickly. 

Another thing that makes BetterMe so useful is being able to download the workouts in advance. I’m in a very rural area, and my home internet isn’t always up to streaming, but that same slow connection will let me download the workout and then play it. 

Not being able to download in advance is  actually why I dropped every other fitness app I tried. I’ve tried a lot. Some of them said you could download the workout, but even with a good connection the download would take an hour or so. These downloads are usually less than 15 minutes on my bad connection (as long as I have any connection at all). 

A solid five stars for this one!I really like this app. I’m 73 and in fairly good physical condition. I’ve just begun using the trial membership.  Even for someone my age, there are so many workouts to choose from. I love that I can mirror the workouts to my large tv screen. So much easier to see!  The only downside for me is the cost. Living on a very very small social security monthly income the cost is too much for my budget. I wish they would offer a low, monthly, yearly or lifetime membership fee for seniors. As much as I love this app, sadly I will have to cancel my trial membership. I will definitely miss it. The cost is the reason for only 4 stars.I love this app it’s been a great help and right now I’ve been trying to go on the app and it signed me out and I try to sing back in but it doesn’t let me it said there is a problem and I re do everything and it tells me that I can’t to any exercise because I have bad WiFi connection which I don’t the WiFi is working fine the app has some bugs that need to be fixed so I can continue to use it because it’s a great app for me.",0,So much more than I thought I was getting!Really nice workout appThe app needs some bugs to be fixed!,JaieLilBooBooBabygen0206,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,461,has_social,24

I thought i was paying for an actual personal trainer and their pre-recorded videos. However they look animated and some of the movements they have you do are not realistic. The calorie tracking and other stuff is ok but I’ve seen better in other apps. I reached out to customer service and they where not very helpful. I used the app twice and immediately reached out to them that I wanted a refund and wasn’t going to use the app. They said they could give me pale tail refund but honestly what’s the point. You have an unhappy costumer that would like their money back and didn’t even use the app for 3 days and expect the pay for half of the service that they don’t even want? Please make that make since. Do better “BetterMe”. If y’all for people than give me a full refund. But obviously you’re not. Don’t download the app. Don’t waste your money.I agree with some of the reviewers. I paid 4.99 for the app and I was under the impression that it was 4.99 period and that was it no, I was about to get change every seven days. I don’t like that on the tracking food does not have everything. I had to go on the internet to figure out what my calorie count was. So I just gave up to write down everything I ate and try to count the calories. This app is so discouraging me. The fasten button should automatically start over again, that’s not the case you have to stop or start and my fasting start before I get up in the morning. It’s only one measurement to count your water so if your not math savvy then you will have to research how much water you have to drink. You guys have to put different food up. Y’all really need to work with the people that is trying to lose weight like myself and now I’m back at square one because this app is not helpful. That’s the reason for the one star.If you asked me yesterday (day 28)  what I would have rated this app, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, after I have finished their 28 day challenge, I don’t have other options for more workouts. Even if I were to restart from day 1, I am still unable to change the intensity of each workout. I would like to continue using this app being that I paid for a 6 month subscription only if someone can guide me in the right direction of changing or updating my workouts. I see under “community” there are plenty of different workouts available for people to do without “tracking”...  Please help me understand what else I need to do. If this is the only option for a 6 month subscription, I would rate it a poorly advertised 1 star.  I would gladly change my rating accordingly.I have national power lifting records and know how to work out and intermittent fast but covid got me side tracked so i was hoping for something to motivate me and keep me on track! This apps features including during workout doesn’t spend the time before the timer begins to tell you the technique but rather waits until the timer is ticking! It is also not very useful for calorie tracking due to lack of know what “Asian-salad is  which” and has no note for when you ate

Hopefully she gets it together and does a better job for her real followersI strongly believe this is a scam or something of that kind where you will lose your money.

Then I downloaded again but they are never let me access my account. I sent forgot password and they said they cannot recognize my email. I sent 3 emails to their support and there is no response even after 2 days. Now I need to check with my bank for filing a dispute against BetterMe to get my money back.I would give 0 stars but am unable to. Was excited to start my journey to getting fit and healthy and got a week into the app, religiously doing my program each day and ended up locked out because I don’t want to pay for any challenges. Allows you into app but won’t let you access any tracking options or workouts or anything unless you pay to do one of their challenges. Total waste and scam saying it’s free - it’s only free to download. If you want to make any progress you’re stuck subscribing to their food/workout challenges - no choice given not to. 
10/10 would not recommend at this pointthe ads show that you can get a better lifestyle by getting meal plans and realistic workouts, but other reviews not only claim that the workouts are not easy to do as the woman in the photo. ALSO, think you can get this free? well you have to pay for the meal plan, which i compromised, but after the second day - proud of starting a streak - i was let down by seeing you had to be a MEMBER to continue. why lead people on for two days, then letting us down on the third? now, i have to find another workout routine that’ll fit me - hoping i still have motivation that i had with this.Reached out to support weeks ago still haven’t been contacted or had my issues resolved. Worked great during free trial but so many issues later on. The workout voice overs don’t match up with the workouts. My data isn’t saved for food tracking and calories. I kept getting “couch yoga” workouts which I marked not interested each time but continued to get. I’m just not a fan of working out on my couch. I will be going through Apple to get my refund since support for this app is nonexistent.Downloaded the app thinking it would be a reasonable tracking method and the features seem nice. Didn’t even get to look at it more than once until I noticed 2 charges on my account. It’s a weekly subscription on top of additional costs to even get a plan made for you! The subscription is hidden outside of the app and very difficult to track down the cancellation options, I would have deleted the app if I hadn’t forgotten about it and still been charged continuously!I’m so disappointed. I enjoyed the trial. Started today ready to really get serious about tracking and workouts. Purchased the subscription. Was charged for it. Then the app wouldn’t work at all. It never created a log in for me so I can’t even access it to troubleshoot. Several emails to the support center with no response. Deflating to a working mom who had finally made the time to commit to health and fitness. I feel like I was so misled.I don’t recommend this app only because of the customer service. Due to a recent back surgery I asked for a refund for the month and cancelled the subscription. I wanted to be able to use all aspects of the app but instead they said I could continue to use it as a tracking tool for nutrition, etc. The subscription was cancelled but no refund was issued. I would have reactivated it once I was cleared from my doctor but that won’t be happening now.Be careful with the subscription. Only once you buy it you will find out that all advertised features actually cost extra. The food tracking feature is included but it is far behind other food tracking apps. And if you request a refund (which I did after using the app for 1 hour), you’ll get an email from customer service referring you to a long document that pretty much says that you are screwed. This is a typical bate and switch scheme, I took the bate, you shouldn’t.The app is great and has helped me lose weight by tracking many different things. There is lots of exercise routines. However, after paying for a year subscription, I was logged out of my account and now I can’t get back in. I reached out to customer service three different times with no response. I feel like I’ve just wasted money because I still have 10 months left on my subscription.I was led to believe via their marketing that I would have daily workouts tailored to my body type and fitness level as well as help with diet again personalized. The workouts are not customize to my body type and the meals are unrealistic things that might be great if I had a home chef. This is essentially a tracking app with a list of workouts and daily meal suggestions. Not helpful to me and I feel deceived to what I thought I was Paying forI should have spent the same amount of money for the premier MFP app or Peloton. There is little to gain in this app. No food tracking, or weight tracking. There are only a limited number of work outs and the community isn’t really a community it is just more basic information. It is legitimately a $139 water tracker. Am I using the ap wrong? Oh there is no feature that tours you through the ap either. What am I missing?  I don’t get it. I want a refund and I will never get one.The workouts were not bad. Short and sweets but high enough intensity to get a decent sweat. However, you don’t get much for the 12 week weight loss program. I was hoping to get some sort of meal plan with the subscription or at the very least better meal tracking. Then after about two weeks into the program the app just completely reset all my progress back to Day 1 and the app support took 1 week+ to respond. Bottom line I would not recommend.I was really disappointed with this app

The food untake log is cumbersome and inaccurate. It has member submitted calorie counts but the portion sizes are very inaccurate. The database lacks simple foods and the MyFitnessPal pal or Fitbit app are better at tracking food intake with more macros than just fat and calories. 

The work outs are ok but nothing with the price this app costs. You get better coaching and routines with other apps. 

The cancellation process is a nightmare. There is no option in the app. I reached out o customer service a week ago and they send a - we got your request email but no follow up. The. Today a week later they charge me for the next month, despite wanting to cancel.

The food recording is ridiculous-good luck finding what you are looking for in the measurement that is reasonable. Many different measurements seem to have been done by a completely inept person/machine, having 5 different measurements that all say the same calories. Then, you HAVE to give access to every part of your health on apple in order for it to track your steps or to even log your weight? I don’t use apple health and don’t want to share my information with it. I can understand the steps but allowing just the step tracking to share does not work at all, it still requires you to share everything. What is the point of having separate sections if yo can’t allow one section. These issues render half of the app unuseable, add to the fact it doesn’t sync with Fitbit, and I def wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone unless you are only looking to read the little quips which are nice but so far are all information you can get free online in weight loss articles, just broken down in smaller bites. The water tracker is nice, and I haven’t tried the workouts yet since I use another app for those that is easing me into them.
The daily log in award thing doesn’t even work correctly.  For 3 days it told me I was at “day 5” and then I updated the app and it sent me back to 1.  
And despite what the response to my negative review says, it does not sync with Fitbit.  There is not even an option.Though the idea of this app is exactly what I want, the follow through on it has been awful. For starters, the food logging system is just pitiful, you all dont have the brand options that other apps do, and it makes it very hard to accuratley track my meals. Tracking my meals has been made significantly harder too because you all use a slider for the calories. The slider does not work as it should, because it moves as soon as you lift your finger. And even when you do get it to stay where you’ve put it, the slider locks in on what appear to be very arbitrary numbers, meaning that you can’t EVER get an accurate reflection of your calorie intake. I would also argue that this slider feature would make this app impossible to use for people with any sort of disability that limits their dexterity, and for individuals with poor eyesight or diseases that cause their extremities to shake. 

I have sent the above information directly to the contact listed in-app, and I would like to say that if the developers changed these two things (the slider, and the sub-par food database), as well as the lack of reasonably priced/attainable ingredients in their in-app recipes I would be willing to give the app another try and probably rate it 5 stars, but until then I’ve got a year long subscription to an app that I can’t use properly.I’ve used several health apps over the years and  thought I’d give this one a try after seeing an ad. I was prepared to potentially waste $40 if it wasn’t as good as it appeared. Aaaand…  It’s not. I found the process to track food cumbersome. The barcode scan didn’t work on a single food I tried and many foods weren’t found in the database at all, so I had to manually enter the macros. No ability I could find to copy a meal, so I had to go through the same annoying process of entering each component of my breakfast every morning. After Day 3 of that, I’d had enough. Other features, such as weight and exercise tracking, were difficult to navigate to and set up. Nothing user friendly at all about this app. $40 blown. That they don’t offer a 7-day trial should tell you something. 

There are far better options out there, so I’d suggest googling “best health and fitness app” and reading a few articles to find one. That’s what I did and found a far superior option for about the same investment. 

Oh, and I find the responses BetterMe gives to critical reviews here annoying. Don’t blame the reviewer, folks; make a better app.While I want this app to be great it is not. It looks pleasing to the eye but the ease of use is poor. The calorie tracking is off, they offer you recipes with the option to press “log” but pressing that does nothing. You still have to manually log in the meal. It’s very frustrating. I like the fitness training portion of it but it’s not guided by voice or ANYTHING. so you have to stare at your screen to see when the time is up and you move on to the next exercise .rearing your neck around to check the time is counterproductive. Plus you have to manually press next through a lot of the warmups . So basically you kind a need to hold your phone or have it so close because you need to touch it to proceed. I’m super disappointed . I paid 60$ so I’m using the app but most def using Lifesum app for my food calculator. If they could make the fitness portion guided, and update the food tracker to reflect the content that they put into the app logging wise it would make this app much better and user friendly. The exercises are good and I do feel like I’m getting a good workout. Also the recipes are good too.I’m torn between at 2 or 3 star rating. I purchased 3 months worth of this app and would not recommend paying for it. The first week I used the app I liked it a lot but as I realized some of my expectations of myself did not fit with what I was actually capable of doing I found I was not able to adjust my plan. I could edit my profile but my plan stayed the same and this discouraged my desire to continue using the app and keeping up with streaks. 
I also found it frustrating that i paid to use the app and then also was expected to pay to participate in challenges. 
I loved the menu and diversity of meals suggested but the pictures don’t match the recipe and the recipes are so basic that they were hard to figure out exact how to cook something. Also, once again, I was unable to change the way it had set up my plan so that it fit what I actually needed. I also was unable to save or find meals that I had made and wanted to make a second time.
I like the idea of the app but it definitely needs some work.I haven’t been using this app for too long so I don’t think I’ve seen all flaws if there are any. But I think it’s great, I love the quizzes to give on nutrition and exercising. There is one thing, the tracker to see how many steps you take is great. Although I’m not sure if it’s tracking when I’m driving as well. I don’t know if it knows when you’re going too fast and that you’re not walking, but if it doesn’t I wish you could turn off the tracker temporarily or be able to edit the number. But besides that this app is great. 
Edit: Like I said this app is great but then apparently I’ve been using premium features I guess? I don’t know but all I know is that I’ve been tracking my calories, water in take, doing quizzes and getting my steps in. Then I open the app today on home screen and it said get premium and it won’t let me access the home page. So I can’t use anything without paying and I’m not paying so I guess I’ll just delete the app.I’ll start from the beginning ….. I saw the ads on FB and read a lot of positive reviews, so I went ahead and downloaded the app and sighed up for 3 months to start. 

At first, everything seems to work great, great motivational articles, user friendly calorie trackers, vast selection of workout options. Until day 15, I opened the app and realized all my previous logs were gone! I closed the app and reopened, and made sure I was signed in, still there was nothing… I double checked my online account, it showed my previous two week workout time records, but nothing else… I reported the issue, a week has passed, no one even got back to me.

In the meantime, I didn’t want to loose the exercise momentum, so I started from day 1 again, but adding a few other routines through the app’s large pool of workout sessions. However, today I realized, after a long sweaty full cardio session, that the app did not log my workout minutes… (yes I was following the session found in the app). I went ahead and tried to manually log them in, the app would not let me (tried countless times)

I personally value the tracking feature in a workout app more than anything else. As an exercise newbie, I rely on looking at the progress to keep me motivated, but unfortunately I cannot trust this app to do even that….There are nice features in this app from the targeted fitness, reminders for water intake, timers for fasting, and calorie tracking.
Water intake, steps, weight tracking are all available in the health app so nice it’s in one space but not novel. 

The exercises aren’t daunting or coming with mega changes to the schedule to be a turn off. 

However, I initially got the app for the meal planning and recipe suggestions. It was (WAS) good, if not great, with a list of all items in the recipes planned for the week, low cal yummy choices picked from a list so I could avoid foods I don’t eat and the ability to switch options at meal time (if day you planned to eat soup but would rather have chicken.). 

BUT the developer decided the variety, options, shopping lists and substitutions were not necessary anymore. I feel like I’m in a box and have no purpose for the app. In trying to change habits and for the two weeks I had the “old” app with the flexible meal plan, I was making progress but the new plan keeps offering fish- which I don’t eat with no options so I’m now standing in front of the fridge trying to decide what to make. There are no longer options, substitutions, or planning tools. Good luck if you don’t have the odd single serving ingredients on hand, because you are not going to be able to use this app.I’ve only had the app for a day, but I’m extremely disappointed with the food tracking and step tracker. I tried scanning a riced cauliflower dish and a Healthy Choice meal, neither of which was a known barcode. When items did scan, it wasn’t scanned to the serving size. Lots of guesswork to figure out the ounces in an egg or slice of reduced fat cheese! I’m not sure how much time I’m willing to invest just to ensure my calories are accurate on this app when I have another app that has such a vast database my local grocery store deli items in it. Maybe this app assumes everyone has a food scale?  
Also not impressed that step tracking and exercise tracking isn’t done by using a fitness watch. I certainly don’t carry my phone with me 100% of the day and ended up over 3K steps short of what my watch tracked.I loved this app for the workouts, calorie counting, and measurement tracking. I actually lost 27 pounds using these features. I hate that they have now added mental health and meditation features to my Home Screen and daily checklist which they will not let me remove. Those kinds of features are not why I got this app and they should be optional. I have stated this in several ways and they added more instead of giving me a way to remove them from my personal program. I fully understand that those things are needed and wanted by some but they should be added to your daily program by choice, not put on your checklist without an option to remove. I have canceled my subscription and will be deleting the app.This app has the potential of being great, the workouts are amazing but everything else is below average when compared to other apps. Tracking your meals is ridiculously difficult, I ate a chicken cutlet wedge today for lunch but you cannot find exactly that, or the Caesar salad I ate it doesn’t show simple options. I don’t like using my phone for workouts so I use the mirror options to my TV but this app doesn’t allow this option or at least it doesn’t work. Also, there’s no voice that tells you what’s going on in the video so when you’re doing your 30 second workout you constantly have to lift/turn your head to check the time, sometimes I would still be doing the workout and the app had moved on to the next one without notice. Disappointed.The workout offers and all the calorie tracking and everything is great, has amazing useful potential but it’s so laggy and buggy.
I have a brand new phone, updated all the way, on good wifi but it freezes up at almost every command.
Start workout-says I can use full screen mode, I try to x out, doesn’t respond, press it a few times, no response, finally turn screen rotation on, turn phone, video starts over 4 times on itself like it was finally responding to the clicks prior but it’s stuck on the downloading workout screen.
Try to log calories, type in food, click option, doesn’t respond, wait awhile, nothing, click option again, no response, then it responds over a minute later, lagging opening and closing the last command.
Exiting and retuning to app sometimes gets it working but that shouldn’t have to be done everytime. 
I paid for a workout plan I can’t use it on such a buggy app.So many great things all in one place - love the concept.
My current focus is tracking calories. It’s kind of a mess. I could handle the annoying redundancy of the different options, for a bit. Then noticed that my calories were different each time I logged in, something was resetting my calories on food already entered. So tedious. 
Additionally. I bought it for the wall Pilates work out that were advertised on social media…only to find out there were very few actual workouts of that kind. A little bummed.This works well if you are just tracking your own info, but they don’t have an option in the meal plan to avoid certain things. I cannot eat most seafoods and even though I put it in, seafood is almost daily in the meals. You can’t track your measurements besides weight. They have normal workouts free, but every single challenge costs a couple bucks. If you eat a food that isn’t on their list you have to reinput it every single time you eat it because it doesn’t save. 
This app works, but there are better onesI would not suggest buying this app for any help with nutrition . I bought the 28 day challenge and the calories that app suggested ve their coach recommended were really far apart when I reached out to coach and let her know what I ve been eating she suggested the calories were a lot .. and they took so long replying to your queries that after a certain point you loose interest. 
The 2 stars are for tracking they have great trackers and their database cover all foods including Indian meals which most of the apps don’t doI have been using this app for 2 months. It is great regarding the exercise and tracking your meals. However, I choose my meal plan by mistake while trying to navigate the app the first time I tried to use it then I tried to change it I could not. I tried to communicate with the developers many times through the chat option but no response since last month. I hope with this review I would get my answer!!!!!I wanted to like this app, the exercises were well organized. However the meals generated are way to out there, the menu it makes has you buying so many random ingredients. There should be a way to have it batch foods together so you can reuse ingredients weekly. But the killer that made me hate this was the search engine for tracking meals has no database practically. It only lets you enter food in ounces and can’t calculate calories for anything. I’m just sticking with my old meal tracking app. The subscription for this is too expensive.I’m finding that this app is not easy to use with  the barcode scanner and tracking food. No matter what the serving size is on the package, the app scans the serving size as 3.53 ounces. It can’t be changed! How the heck am I supposed to figure out how much 2 tablespoons of pancake syrup is to be? And that’s not the first food I’ve brought up that I’m having the same trouble on. The more I fiddle with this the more I regret my subscription.
The positive is that it’s easy to track water, steps and exercise. Please add size options for food.Started the free trial 3 days ago. On day two, the reading suggested I try their meal plans at a low price of $15 for the first month. 

I’m in it to win it, so I accepted… only to find out I already had access to the meal plan with my free trial??? And I’m not wowed by it. 

Requested refund twice. Haven’t heard back.

I also lost all my “progress/tracking” from my first day. All calories, water, steps, exercise—gone. Tried logging in online in hopes my progress was saved there—no. 

I want this app to save me time. Not take more time away with these irritations.

Concerned of wasting my time logging meals and water and exercises again if it’s all going to disappear. The app is attached to my email. It should save.

2 stars because I do enjoy the exercises.I am generally enjoying the layout of this app and the way I see my daily plan. The food logging needs major improvement. Why are ounces the only serving size for so many foods? I’m doing a ton of guessing because I can’t choose tsp or Tbl. Also, tracking water is part of my daily plan, but when I select it I’m asked to pay extra to get it? Lame when I’ve already purchased a 12 week package.For the price paid the macro tracking and calorie tracking should be much better than it is. The app doesn’t allow you to change the weight scale (grams, ounces etc) or select other options to track food.  Not a good app for tracking diet. Also, there are tons of other apps that don’t require additional purchases to access workouts. I would not buy again and do not recommend this app for purchase.I had the app, I got rid of it. I don’t need all the meal and calorie tracking. I don’t need a plan or program. I just wanted the wall Pilates exercises and you can’t get that with paying money for a bunch of junk I don’t need. Make those basic exercises their own app or free or a flat not exorbitant amount and use this whole app for people who want more or want a subscription!i was loving the app until it told me i could no longer use the daily water-tracking and meal tracking. it said i HAD to pay for the premium to get those which is absolutely ridiculous. uninstalling because that’s what i wanted it for. other then that i liked the workouts even though they were very easy and the meal and water tracking was great until i could no longer use itI’ve had this app for a few months at this point and I was really liking it, because I used it mainly for workouts (food tracking isn’t worth it). 
I think it just updated or something because it’s arranged in a much more complicated way and I can’t even tell what workouts are in what plan or which ones I’ve done already !

Functions I appreciated: keeping track of nutritional intake, daily steps, weight , and a variety of at home exercise videos to do at your own pace and fitness level. 
What I don’t appreciate: In the app it shows tracking heart rate, and sleep. A promo plug kept encouraging me to purchase a $60 better me fitness band to maximize all the above. Sadly that’s a lie. The band isn’t even fully compatible with their app yet. $60 wasted. The band took 6 weeks to receive which was a bit ridiculous. 
Over all I lost over 15 pounds in 2 months but I contribute it all to managing calories because I only did a couple of the workouts a week due to being a night shift nurse with a limited amount of time to work out. I did reach out to them and they suggested fasting often which I already did, but not by choice.  I like the workouts when I can do them but I’m not sure if it’s worth the cost since I’ve yet to compare it to anything else. 
I’d like to see compatibility to band and app, a better way to customize workouts to specific days vs daily reminders that I’m not working out. If I could workout more i would but I’m working 16 hours a day and sleep all day until it’s time to get ready to go back. I’d love to be able to set what days I can workout and then load a workout for that specific day.Workouts are mostly great. It helps to hear and follow along without having to stare at the phone for what’s next and when to transition; however, there are a lot of errors. The app should allow for quick feedback by workout because it’s weird when you are doing a completely different exercise based on audio than is demonstrated on video, or you do the same exercise multiple times on the right as instructed thinking you’ll come back to left and never do, etc.  Also I purchased the 30-day toned tummy challenge for $4.99…has no narration that explains the move and no transition warning, so unless you are staring at the phone, you cannot follow along with ease.  Haven’t seen enough at home fitness that caters to the use of just hand weights. Many at home workouts refer to equipment needed like machines (or two) in a gym. Have to click on each workout to see what I can do with the equipment I have at home.  I tried to use it for food tracking but felt like other apps had better functionality.  Also responsiveness to questions is the worst I’ve seen. Then when they finally respond, you’ve moved on to something else. At this point, I could use great workouts and device connectivity to other popular apps.I really wanted to give this a try. Had the free version for a while so said why not. The workouts are tailored to your goals which is rlly a nice touch and different than any other app I have used. They get points for that.
But! And it’s a big BUT. After purchasing there’s not really anything added from the free version aside from simple log/tracking, most of which it just grabs from the iPhones health app anyway. You get these ads for extra “challenges” that are like 30-60$, not included. The tracker doesn’t let you log your own work outs which you will need to do some Bc theirs feels like it misses a few things. It tends to force quit when doing the outdoor walk/running work outs. The meal logging also makes you do some guess work as to the weight of any item you eat so it’s not so accurate.. That being said, You will end up using several other apps to fill in where this one fails. They do have a great IG account with plenty of challenges and food/diet recommendations. They have a support person on your account you can reach out to as well which is nice. But again, There’s no reason to spend your money here, the price is kind of outrageous for an app considering how much better the competition is in this space.I got this app because I needed something that had a bit of everything. I’ve tried food tracking apps and I have the Fitbit app, but it’s hard to find workouts on either. This app has great workouts for newbies, like me, and I’m sure higher levels. So far I have been just the right amount of challenged by the workouts. HOWEVER, the food tracking on this app is absolutely awful. I don’t tend to be on my phone throughout the day to log what i eat so I log everything at night and god forbid if I’m a minute past midnight, everything logs for the next day and you can’t go back and log for the previous day. Also, there is not many brands on here as far as food choices go, I mean they didn’t even have Starbucks anything. Very frustrating to keep accurate logs when you just have to click random a foods and drinks that only half match what you actually consumed. It’s not quite worth what I paid because of this, but I’m hoping it will improve.I gave this app a chance for about a week and I found the most frustrating part was tracking my calories. It was very difficult to find certain things and the measurements were limited. I also found that the calories were off when I compared them with another app that got better reviews. I did enjoy the articles but I will say that I didn’t try the workouts. I was losing weight with the calories tracker so that’s why I didn’t get to those. Since calorie tracking was my biggest use, I have decided to go with another app that is much easier and user friendly. It also costs way less.I downloaded the ap and purchased the wrist tracker which after 2 weeks I have not received. I enjoy the articles and the tracking all in one place EXCEPT the calorie tracker!
All the food is measured in ounces! Who does that? Also be sure to check the different listings. For instance a banana is about 20 carbs, there’s one that list it as ha I g 89 carbs. There are many more listing like this as well. How did they get on the list and do you measure your banana in ounces?? The calorie tracker is not user friendly. I ask Siri about the  portion size and carbs and calories then pick one from the list that is comparable.I have been using this app for the last 2 weeks. I’ve enjoyed it. And love having these workouts at hand. 
However with the latest update I’ve noticed that the app is glitching in ways it hasn’t before. 
I had already turned on all tracking for health to be synced. But now everything but the “active energy” tab is turned on. And that’s the important one to track my move ring on my watch. 
I’ve turned it on multiple times within the app and within the health app. As soon as I turn all tabs on. I try to view my statistics on the BetterMe app and it’s locked AGAIN. I once again turn on all tabs in health to track/sync and reload the app. Try to see if the statistics updated and LOCKED AGAIN!!
It’s been frustrating. The next update needs to have this addressed. 

I’ve googled help and one person has the same issue but no successful result.I overall like the app for meal options, workouts and health tracking. However, I have encountered serious app glitches that have ended in my being double-charged a yearly subscription and still not having access to the full meal plan and all. I keep seeing a “lock” symbol and request for payment, which then tells me I already have the subscription, but still bars access. The app also frequently freezes and I have lost my data at least once now. I have attempted to send emails but have received no response.The workout section of this app is great! You can choose from a variety of workouts and log them easily. Other exercises log automatically through the health app. The meal tracking is cumbersome and I stopped using it. For example, if you want to log an egg you can’t just log 1 egg you have to log it by ounces. Who knows that or wants to find it for all their food? I find I prefer another apps food tracking much better because it is much more intuitive. I’m also annoyed that I can’t select sugar in the foods to avoid section for my meal plan.Good thing I only decided to do the trial run and not renew my subscription. I think that a lot could be improved with this app, but mainly the calorie tracking section is totally inaccurate and makes manual tracking a pain. After a while I just gave up tracking my meals because everything I searched for wasn’t there. This app should not be more than $15 let alone $30 per month.I like some features. I don’t like the food tracking feature. It doesn’t recognize simple foods. Didn’t recognize dried cran raisins. Don’t like the odd measurements. Seems like I always have to either type it in as new food or scan it. Tracking  my workout has been fine. I’ll keep at it.",0,"Developers need to get the ball rollingWorkouts mostly great but service is badNot worth the $Good, but needs workOther Food Trackers are BetterGreat PotentialGreat app. Only complaint is active energy not staying linkedSerious App IssuesNot a fan of the meal trackingNot worth the money I spentApps ok","kwvyer gcire,codemdvTIK96mrstealyomemeMaikayla jljzmason731Gorhopfox. rector. 🤒Elriel7LfriesmuthRebecca P OvDaisy64!",BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,1,1,0,1,0,11,1,0,0,1610,has_tracking,74

This app is all about breadth, not depth.

How their workouts work is that they have thousands of ~30 second clips (e.g crunches, ice skaters, mermaid stretch) that they stitch together to create a ton of pretty good workouts.

The workouts are where it shines. The calisthenics, boxing, ab workouts are all stellar. There are some UX glitches (no audio for some exercises). Quite frequently, they’ll say “hold for 30-60 seconds” when the countdown is 10-20 seconds.

That said, there are some concerns about the workouts. The calorie count is a total sham. Pretty sure they assign random digits to the clips. I just did the EASIEST, most pathetic yoga flow (called Calorie Burner, but trust me when I write it was literally just mountain pose and child pose for about 7 minutes) and it said I burned 180 calories.

The diet feature is good. They have a ton of foods to track, and you can edit portions etc. But then part of their daily routine is a mindful listen or read, which is great in practice. But the diet ones can be misleading. Eg, grapes are awful for you with this App—even though food science says grapes are great for you: high in potassium, fiber, and full of water so you get full faster.

Overall, it’s great for giving me a diverse array of workout routines when I’m stuck at home or traveling.I know the app links up to my Apple health and why not but I really wish there was tracking within the app as well. For example track weight loss,track body measurements, steps, ect....I feel like now adays I have to have an app for every part of my health. Would really love for those type of things to be added. Also I love love love that is has tasty meal options my only complaint is I wish there was a way to get a grocery list for he meal options so that I don’t have to go through each day and tally up the ingredients for my weekly shopping trip.",0,"Solid app, but some workouts and diets need improvingGreat app but wish it had a little more features",ChrisB511kristenfayemarie,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,364,has_tracking,74

Stay tuned! :)"", 'modified': '2020-03-11T16:16:49Z'}","The app does an adequate job of helping you keep everything you need to track in one place for the most part. The calorie tracker is very frustrating and time consuming to use however. Simply adding functionality for it to automatically resurface items you’ve tracked before (many of us fitness folks are creatures of habit) like other apps do would go a long way. Instead, it only “remembers” the last 10 things you tracked and after that you have to start from scratch with a new search. Entering key search terms like brand name and item produces an at times seemingly random list of things with the same names and different calorie counts. It takes 3x longer to track a meal than it does with MyFitnessPal and a lot more concentration, sometimes even requiring me to look stuff up online and compare. I’m keeping the app for now because of the exercise program, but unless the tracking becomes a lot more user friendly it’s not a long term solution given the cost.I purchased this app in March! Yeah- amazing access to meals and workouts! I purchased the year subscription. Well something glitched and now I cannot log in. I have contacted the developer and they asked for ALL of the possible emails that I could have used to create the account. None are found. The next message- looks like you signed up and just need to fill out the profile… uhm, I cannot do that if I cannot log in. Please help. This is such a disappointment for weeks now!!! 
     I finally got ahold of someone who reset my account so I could log in. (After trying all the normal things: delete app and reinstall,reset password etc.) Although I lost all the data I was tracking daily- they finally reset my account- and challenge I had also purchased and they updated my renewal. They thankfully reset so I have a year access since I only used about a week- Frustrating at first but so glad they could help!Love the approach of exercise, steps, hydration and food tracking. All these together are giving me a chance at a better me. Loving the program so far. 

Reasons for not giving a 5 are, iPhone and IPad apps don’t work together. App should be device neutral-  Use the devise you have and have any activity or workouts sync up. 

Also app is a little buggy with playback of some workouts with no prompts or visuals. Just ticks down the time  remaining in the exercise. 

Also, profile asks for focus areas yet always provides the same types of workout recommendation even with all areas selected…Arms. I would expect that if more than one focus area was selected, that the recommendations would not always be arms. I don’t have the time to preview the possible workouts everyday to pick the one I want. Want the app to do that for me based on the focus areas selected. 

Lastly, scheduling reminders for workouts if setup, should also drive when workouts at suggested. I use the app to supplement Taekwondo training twice a week. I’d like to not get workouts on those days but the schedule doesn’t really do anything other than pop up a message. It should have those days as off in the suggested workouts. 

Overall, I plan to stick with this program. It has helped start to form some good habits even after 2-3 weeks.The app couldn’t be easier to use and I’m finding it a helpful tool in tracking my diet. 

The app has a mindfulness/psychology component which includes daily lessons that I’ve enjoyed overall. That said, I didn’t appreciate the fact that the app used my answers from yesterday’s lesson in an attempt to motivate me today: the app just sent me a reminder to work out that included the phrase “don’t be lazy!” I had answered on yesterday’s lesson that “lazy” is a word I use in my self talk. Just felt dirty and underhanded that the app was designed to take that information and throw it back at me in an attempt to motivate me.I have an eating disorder and I cannot track calories or meals. I wish I could turn on notifications for workouts only, and it would also be great if I could remove the calorie/meal tracking aspect all together. I really like the workouts, though, so I’m trying to stick with the app. I’m using my regular alarm to try and remind me, which is inconvenient.I wish it was more interactive like Noom, but you can’t beat the lifetime price of $28 for all these trackers and meals I never knew about. Tracking isn’t complicated at all. Hopefully in the future they add an included/free interactive educational platform like Noon to encourage you to reach your goals through facts etc. Noom was way too expensive that’s why I went with BetterMe. Lifetime subscriptions are awesome.I like the workouts offered, but the calorie tracking could use some work. The serving size for most of the items are ""serving size"" and ""ounces"". Most listings don't have options that may make more sense, like cup or tablespoon, etc. It would be really nice if that option was added.This app has good workouts and tracking system for tracking your steps, however it does not have a very wide variety of foods to choose from to log. Even when scanning the barcode of simple things,  the system can’t find them and it doesn’t seem to have very many options to pick from.",0,Decent but the calorie tracker is lackingUpdate/ excellent customer serviceLove this approach and program - app has room for improvementGreat app except for the underhanded remindersWish I could customize moreNot interactivePretty Good but Needs ImprovementsNot too bad,JuanitoElGatoTrimomsarahgln2012Matt ®️FoxsparrowShahmny24clarabear_808heibell,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,927,has_tracking,74

I’ve enjoyed the workouts, intermittent fasting, and especially the daily inspirational reads so far. I downloaded another fitness app to compare and see which one I’d like to stick with for subscription.

 The biggest thing that stands out is that BetterMe does not have an option for manually documenting your weight, and doesn’t have a lot of foods saved by scanning the barcode on items. Also, I have to spend a lot of time each day tracking down my regular food items since they get booted out of the Recent food selection. Logging daily calories should be easier than this. I like so many other things about the app and would happily stay with this product if they can provide an update on the weight & calorie tracking.This app make rethink how I feel about my body. It’s a help to stay focused on healthy eating and exercise. Fasting is a very new experience for me but I think that so far it’s just what I need. I do feel like I’m on my iPhone checking in on tracking meals, hydration, and reading articles too muchbecause I want to make sure I’m keeping up on everything I need to know to be successful at fasting.Recently downloaded this application.

At the end of 2020, I decided I needed to focus on something other than Covid. My husband and I had been dealing with infertility for 10 years and I know I felt solely responsible. We had a talk about trying IVF and I decided that I was probably not at a healthy weight to be considered for it. An acquaintance suggested this app, so I downloaded it and hit the workouts and calorie tracking hard. I feel that I saw results pretty quickly and was super excited to be on the right track to healthy! Two months into using this app, I started looking into clinics that offered IVF. I didn’t need to though, because the same month I discovered I was pregnant. We welcomed our daughter at the end of October 2021. 

I truly see now how important my health is and I have this app and my experience using it to thank for my new outlook. I’m excited to take up where I left off! Thank you for the hard work you’ve put into this program! It has been life changing!!This is an excellent app for weight loss, tracking calories intake, water intake, as well as workout and daily steps. I am doing the 16hours intermittent fasting and amazed by the results in terms of weight loss! I honestly never imagined an app would keep me as motivated as I am today as I usually lose motivation when it comes to healthy cooking and prepping meals. This worked out well because It lets you select the time you want to spend prepping meals and the ingredients you prefer using, so the suggestions for the Keto plan I chose are working great with my schedule, similarly to the exercise portion of it. The only thing I wish was easier to do is the food tracking, I wish it had a feature to group food in a recipe so I can use it another day if I made this recipe again, also if it had a history of the most recent items I used or the ones I keep reusing. 
The last thing (and it’s not as important) but could be improved, is the ability to add fractions the your weight when you log in.I love how many options there are for working out. This app covers so many topics and options, from home workouts to gym, Pilates to HIIT and everything in between. I also love that they provide options for limited mobility and sensitive areas (like sensitive back, knees, etc.) 

This app also has a great filtering system so you can filter by muscle groups, time, and level of fitness. Even no equipment workouts. Makes it great for someone like me with little experience. 

This app also has calorie tracking and different programs for accountability and motivation. Overall I’m very impressed with this app and everything it has to offer.So far i love it!  Only problem is its not tracking my workouts. Probably something I'm doing wrong. I chose not to do the food plan or have trainers or have it notify me ect that  might be why. 
I do the wall pilates then respond with i could do more and more come up!  I do on average 3 more the last being a stretch or cool down.This app is awesome and super easy to use. I love the layout and all the motivational quotes and workout plans. The only flaw is the food tracking. It’s very confusing and not easy to use. That’s why I use another app to track my food but other than that this app is amazing.I have been using this app mainly for tracking my water intake and the workouts they offer. And I have definitely noticed a difference in my body shape and strength since using this app almost everyday for the past month.

Until... I purchased it. Within a couple of hours the regret set in, as I learned the app is just another run of the mill workout/meal plan. I was let down like the lever on a slot machine.  Nothing is customized, preferences don’t matter, and once you make initial selections there is NO going back. It asks you about preferences and goals yet still gives the same basic generic plan to every user. Allergic to a food? You’ll either get over it or not eat, because it will be in your plan multiple times daily. You not a fan of eating all day and want to choose intermittent fasting? Too bad, because with this app you’ll get a meal plan filled with several large meals and snacks daily. Accidentally choose the wrong diet type? Oh well, locked in for life. Avoiding certain workouts due to disability? Heal yourself quick, you’re working whole body on day two! I wanted to love this app, as much as I love mid afternoon naps, but it is so far from user friendly I can’t give it more than one star.I have the app and so does my daughter. We actually like it and has helped with our goals. There was an add for the meal plan onetime purchase for $9.99, I jumped on the offer and was excited to try the meals. Unfortunately I got sick and wasn’t able to try due to restrictions. But that’s not my issue. A week later I was charged (pending)another $9.99 and my statement said it was a subscription. At that point I wrote customer support to cancel my subscription. I wrote reviews and even tried through the app with no response. An automatic email was always sent saying someone would contact me within 8 hours. Then a week later I was charged again. At this point several reviews were written, multiple emails sent, apple support was contacted and nothing!! Apple support said that the purchase was not through apple but the company directly even though I made it through the app. I’m highly upset that this company has stolen my money, will not cancel the subscription I didn’t want, refuses to respond and it doesn’t look like I will be getting a refund. I have had to cancel my card due to this. Worst company ever!!!I am disappointed with the Better Me app as a motivational tool. Initially, I had a positive experience and was making good progress. However, after using the app for about a week and a half, an update was required. Unfortunately, upon updating, all my progress was deleted, forcing me to start from scratch. This setback has been particularly discouraging for me as I was trying to establish a consistent workout routine. 

Losing all my progress due to the update has been demotivating and has hindered my ability to stay on track with my fitness goals. A motivational app should provide consistent support and encouragement, but the Better Me app's failure to retain my progress has had the opposite effect. 

I believe it is crucial for the developers to address this issue promptly and find a solution to prevent data loss in future updates. Additionally, it would be beneficial if they could offer some form of compensation or support to users who have experienced setbacks like mine. 

Overall, while the Better Me app has potential as a motivational tool, the setback caused by the update issue has significantly impacted its effectiveness. I hope the developers take the necessary steps to rectify this problem and ensure a smoother user experience in the future.The meal plans don't allow you to submit any input about what you like and don’t like so at least half of a week’s meals are not helpful because, for example, I’m not going to eat porridge for breakfast (literally, one of the breakfasts calls for porridge).  Plus, it assumes people have time and are at home to cook 3 meals a day... seriously?

Shortly after I signed on the app encouraged me to work with one of their personally coaches by asking a lot of goals questions. So I submitted a question to one of the coaches. I was a little surprised that I had to pay extra for that but I said ok, paid $3.99, and saw a message that the individual usually responds within an hour or so. 

It's been 24 hours now and not only hasn't there been any response, the only evidence that I submitted a question is that I've been charged $3.99 (in addition to my initial subscription charge).

I'm starting to think this app is a scam. I've already turned off auto-renew so we'll see if after my initial week I get charged even more. I certainly hope not because this program has been useless. 

What a waste of money.During the sign-up process, it stated I was supposed to receive a seven day free trial prior to being charged, but instead it charged me right away. I reached out to their customer support several times, but I got no response. I am tired of companies robbing our money and getting away with it. Outside of this, I took a look at the app, and it seems mediocre. There are way better science based apps out there that can help you with your fitness goals without body shaming. Remember that the best exercise for you is something that you can do consistently, and that abs are made in the kitchen.I signed up for the 1-week premium free trial on Sunday March 24. I’ve been doing my workouts diligently and on schedule. I love the reminders and the overall accomplished feeling I get after completing a workout. Today, I was about to start my workout. I open the app, and it doesn’t recognize me at all. No data, no connecting my subscription. Starts me off at Day 1!! What a horrible way to derail my fitness goals when I was trying my hardest to start a routine. I should be starting Day 4 workouts today. Your tech glitch is more than an inconvenience, but a reason why I’ll be canceling any future subscriptions with you....way to go!I’ve been looking for a good app to help me with my health goals for awhile and thought this seemed like a very well-rounded one. However, once signing up for membership, I was very unimpressed with the overall quality of the product. While I tried working with it for a while, the poor user interface and lack of support quickly became more of a headache than help. When requesting a refund for the unused months of service, I was denied a refund and offered free months of membership instead. Not pleased.I usually don’t write reviews but my frustration with this app is so big that I have to. For the price you’re paying, the options are very limited. They sell in a way that the exercises and meal plans will work according to what your goals are, but that doesn’t work. Lots of simple exercises/meals and plans. It just get better if you go up to a plan where you have a coach. Also their fasting doesn’t let you edit if you type it wrong, so in case you’re not planning stop or start a fasting, be careful because it won’t count. Horrible experience.1. On 4 different occasions when accessing the app I received a message suggesting that my subscription had expired when I paid for a year, and only had the app at this time 2 weeks.

2. The meal plans aren’t realistic and when you try to log what you actually ate, 9 times out of 10 I couldn’t find the brand of any of my items, making it very hard to actually track my calories.

3. Without realistic meal plans (which I actually needed) and mediocre exercises I can’t fathom paying this amount to track how much water I drink. 

4. Although I clearly indicated a desire to gain weight, I was unable to adjust the number of calories that I needed to target each day as a 1300 calorie diet (which was suggested by the app) will not aid in weight gain. Lastly, all articles that I received were geared only towards weight loss, also not helpful for those that have other goals.Horrible. Just Horrible. You get one day of the calorie tracker then it's just a workout app and you can't use it well unless you get the un reasonably expensive premium. If you sign up for notifications even WORSE. Even if you want to loose a pound or two after a long weekend of unhealthy food or whatever even the smallest amount of weight loss they will send you a notification stating ""we are worried about your weight loss goals"" trying to be sympathetic but it just makes you feel fat and ugly and horrible the way they say it. TERRIBLE APP!!!!!I was looking for a streamlined way to organize my work out plans for the new year as Id like to hit some new goals. After working with multiple apps I’ve found this one to be much more labor intensive on the user as far as imputing caloric data and also I would change a few of the options for work outs so you can mix it up vs just doing the set program each time.

The offered me different meal ideas but they would end up repeating after so long and most of them did not seem appetizing or did not fit my dietary needs. That was the main reason I wanted to purchase a subscription. 

The offered a calorie tracker where I could enter in my calories for the day. A lot of the things I would eat were not on their food list, and the nutritional facts were wrong compared to the labels on my food. That’s fine, I could manually input my calories, but there’s I cannot manually input anything else so there’s no way I can track carbs or fats, things that are also important to me. 

The only thing I genuinely enjoyed way the workout routines they offered. This is great to help you get started with exercising but this is a terrible meal based diet app. I regret purchasing a subscription and almost feel lied to :/. 

I feel like this could easily have won me over (even if it wasn’t meeting my expectations) by: 
- a list of different meal choices instead of one set for the day (that you may not like), and the nutrition facts of the meal
- the ability to manually track other things besides for only calories.Love the idea and the app has the beginnings of a great thing but it’s far from completed. As other users have noted, there are 7 “programs” that target a specific area of the body. Each program has 28 workouts. You have to do each program once to get a full workout so it is essential 28 workouts. But that’s it. You can’t even set your own water goals. The meals are just the same thing repeated weekly. 

The ads I have seen for the app are very misleading. They show a much more in-depth program that is customizable to your body type and allow you to target specific problem areas. That is not what you will get with the app. If only as much time was put into the content of the app as is put into the content of the ads.Such a struggle. I have been excited to get full use of the app. I want to control the times of my intermittent fasting, however, it doesn’t allow me to do this. I am methodical about any plan I enter into and should be allowed to control certain aspects of my personal al goals. Reaching someone in customer service or even a person to help me is next to impossible. For an additional fee, I suppose someone will help me. 
They have a great idea, but after a few days, I am truly disappointed.To keep it short, it does most of what it sets out to do for content.

The app itself however is very difficult. There’s no way to change entered details and alter your plan goals - even on the website. After deleting and reinstalling to get around this, it now errors out when I try to restore purchases. I don’t have access to my subscription.",0,"Great idea, poorly executed.Great concept.

The workouts are tailored to your goals which is rlly a nice touch and different than any other app I have used. They get points for that.
But! And it’s a big BUT. After purchasing there’s not really anything added from the free version aside from simple log/tracking, most of which it just grabs from the iPhones health app anyway. You get these ads for extra “challenges” that are like 30-60$, not included. The tracker doesn’t let you log your own work outs which you will need to do some Bc theirs feels like it misses a few things. It tends to force quit when doing the outdoor walk/running work outs. The meal logging also makes you do some guess work as to the weight of any item you eat so it’s not so accurate.. That being said, You will end up using several other apps to fill in where this one fails. They do have a great IG account with plenty of challenges and food/diet recommendations. They have a support person on your account you can reach out to as well which is nice. But again, There’s no reason to spend your money here, the price is kind of outrageous for an app considering how much better the competition is in this space.Maybe I’m just not the right target group for this app but I do feel it is lacking  

The workouts are nice. They start at your level and increase as time goes to make sure that you hit your goals. It also gives a great clip of how to properly do the workouts. You can choose the type of workout you like to do (run, home workouts, gym etc.) but it only lets you select 2 options. I do think the app should make an option to have the workouts run through instead of having to hit next or skip to continue. The meal planning is a nice feature but this is where I have an issue. Not a day in my life have I attempted to make an open chicken, squash and ricotta ravioli topped with brown butter sauce. I feel that the meals should be more simple than a recipe that just sounds nice. Especially right now during this quarantine when shopping isn’t the easiest. Meals and water intake are on a preset sliding scale so not much room to customize the actual numbers. 

Also, I feel that a trial would be beneficial. I don’t like apps that make you pay for the membership before you even see what it offers. However, I did bite the bullet and purchase the 3 months.I want to start doing more body weight exercises and just generally taking better care of myself. So my goals are weight gain and improved muscle tone, so many things are geared towards weight loss, I can’t even adjust my total calories goal! The reading is focused on weight loss too. Unless the stated goal is weight loss I do not think the app should reference weight loss even once, this is not healthy for people who are possibly underweight for mental health reasons. Otherwise it’s a perfectly adequate app.I really like where you are going with this app, however I feel like the app would benefit from a few minor updates. I wish that there was a diary section, where we could track our eating habits, and maybe even write down our goals and keep pictures of our progress. I also really like the recipes, but I wish there was a grocery list that lets you know exactly what to buy. That would be convenient.",0,Not worth the $Needs to be more personalizedToo focused on weight LOSS.Just a suggestion..,mrstealyomeme4thtryatanicknameAmberM1886melisaxxmariexx,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,624,has_goals,32

But I realized a couple months in that I am tired and sluggish and my fat pants are not fitting so well. Well I saw my old friend Mr. Scale and those numbers weren’t nice.
I looked for an app that wasn’t aggressive with the notifications but also gave you options on wha you like as a plan to get and stay active. 
I got the 3-month plan with walking workouts as my way to exercise and whoa who knew that walking was this intense?
I like the water intake goal but it’s the reason I gave it 4-stars as opposed to 5. The app is sneaky and won’t let you put your water intake in unless you sign up for an additional paid portion which is the training portion I think it begins at another $30, I have the Apple Watch so this app popped up and it allows you to enter your water intake there. I thought that was a bit underhanded especially for those who don’t have the watch to go around the app.

But overall it’s a good app to help you focus on your health goals and not obsess about your weightI wish it was more interactive like Noom, but you can’t beat the lifetime price of $28 for all these trackers and meals I never knew about. Tracking isn’t complicated at all. Hopefully in the future they add an included/free interactive educational platform like Noon to encourage you to reach your goals through facts etc. Noom was way too expensive that’s why I went with BetterMe.

I am just getting back into exercising after years of not being active so im not super familiar with the names of different exercises. On the daily plan workouts you see a 5 second preview of the move before the 30 seconds starts. I find that the exercise is half over by the time I figure it out then I’m rushed into the next. Other than this I love the app! It has helped keep me motivated in reaching my fitness goalsNeeding to lose some weight and change my eating habits was difficult for me. This App helped hold me accountable until I got into a routine and now love it my routine! Yes, the exercises are a little slow and boring, burning 20 calories or less (or maybe I was in a hurry to see weight loss!) I’m a want to see results person so I added a 2 mile brisk walk to get my daily steps in and alternating core/cardio for 20 minutes daily. Logging your food really holds you accountable and that’s probably my favorite part of the app, pushing to clear my goals every day! I’ve lost 8lbs in 3 weeks!If you learn the billing of this app; you will be fine.

The water tracker, calorie counter, exercise collection is awesome.

The best features that helped me:
1. Meal Prep
I got introduced to many great low carb meal options. This is great. Don’t really care for all keto meal plan - asks me to eat salad every day :D

2. Intermittent fasting.  Game changer for me. I had heard of it but never been guided like this app helped me.  So great work on incorporating fasting into the plan.

I am still struggling to figure out to switch back to a non-keto meal plan.  I guess once u take the quiz and put your weight goals; the meal plan is it. No changing it.

I think customer service and billing can definitely be improved on BetterMe.

Otherwise I’m sticking to BetterMe and not moving to Noom.

I absolutely LOVE this app!!! It does nearly everything I need it to, it’s a great motivator, it makes dieting easier, and it teaches me how to work out from home! I have little to complain about from my experience so far.

BUT (ahh there’s always a “but” isn’t there…) I wish we were able to have more control over the “Log Calories”/nutrition section. Some people’s dietary goals (carbs, fats, proteins) are different than others and sometimes it’s based on dietary preferences. For example: I live a keto lifestyle and am unable to set my carb goal to 20g max due to it being based off of my BMI. I love that I can manually adjust how many calories I wish to limit myself to, but it would be nice to be able to have it more hands-on in that sector.

But that’s really the only negative thing I have to say about this app. Toodles! 👋✨I have continually gained weight since I stopped playing sports in college. I am about 85lbs heavier than when I left college. I have always struggled to find the right place to get motivated again. I have tried diet after diet. I have tried fitness app after fitness app. This app actually motivates me. I’m a completionist so being able to completes these daily goals is an amazing feeling, the variety of foods I can choose from when I eat. It has only been two days but I can tell I’m gonna stick to it.Super great app it might need to improving because some people can’t afford the better me pro but other than that it’s really good and I would totally recommend it I don’t do reviews at all but this app totally deserved it really good app totally recommend certain that you will be happy with the results nothing will stop you from reaching your goals with this up super awesome keep doing what are you doing better me and thank you!! 💗💗🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻This app is awesome! A lot of workout apps aren't that good because they don't really help lose some weight, and this is only my first time doing the workout, and I feel like it really helps. It also calculate the amount of steps you took and it sets goals for you! Also, it give s you goals for how much calories you eat per day! (If you set that) But in my opinion it's a really good workout app! I really recommend this app!Great app but just like anything related to making your body better and eating right it takes commitment. The app does great to help encourage you, help you set goals and enforce them so over all an awesome app. I really enjoy the simplicity of the work outs and how it shows what angle you need to pay attention too to achieve the goal of that specific work out.i love this app so much. it has changed my perspective of how to workout and how i workout. this app gives you many different choices for what you want to work on, you can track your goals, and there are ways you can communicate with others to see what they do. they push you to your best, a best you didn’t even know you had. i have had this app for only about a week or two and i can already feel and somewhat see a difference for how i look at myself. plus they never show any adds and never push you to get a ‘premium’. it’s a 10/10 app for me!I’ve never been so motivated to work out, it sets realistic goals that I can do even on my busy days and then you can pick more short workouts of you have the time and energy",0,MORE CONTROL OVER THE NUTRITION SECTION PLEASECouldn’t find motivation... until nowSuper 🄰🅆🄴🅂🄾🄼🄴 App!!! 💗Just what is saysCommitmentperfect workout appLove it!

I just went into the app to check how many hours I am at in my current fast I started and logged in the app last night. Everything is gone! It is forcing me to create an account. I don’t know if I had created one with an email back in March or not. When I try to ask for assistance with a forgotten password it emails me saying I don’t have an account with that email address. I have exactly 2 gmail email accounts. One for things like this and one for important stuff that I actually want emails about. It doesn’t recognize either email for a password reset. So all my history is gone. It you are going to update an app and force setting up email logins you need to include a way for those already using the app to keep their information.I would rate this app negative stars if I could. Not on performance, because I never actually used it, but based off of the company behind it. I downloaded this app along with a few others just to look through. I deleted the app right after downloading it without knowing that just downloading it would activate a monthly subscription that I never agreed to. I am now being charged more than $10 a month with no way to unsubscribe. I’ve tried contacting the company, which is difficult because their contact us section is very limited, with only an email or contact form. I have done both with no response. Apple has no history of me even having the app so it doesn’t even show up in my subscriptions in my settings on my iPhone. The company is garbage and will not cancel the subscription or issue me a refund for the now more than $40 they have STOLEN from me!! Stay away from this app!First off, I downloaded multiple workout apps that I thought would work for me. On the app it had told me that if I wanted to see the extent I would have to pay a certain amount of money per month, etc. Being curious I decided to purchase it, BUT they gave me a FULL FREE MONTH TRIAL!!!! After the month my subscription expired, So I decided to cancel my subscription until I was able to come back and pay. In explanation I did not have money to purchase another month. So I CANCELED MY SUBSCRIPTION FEBRUARY 25TH THE DAY IT EXPIRED. It even says so in my Apple Subscription BUUT!!!!! IN MY APPLE PURCHASE HISTORY ANNND BANK ACCOUNT, They had charged me the $9.99 For the next month!!! I am absolutely upset! They took part of my rent money from my bank account, my hard earned money and even when I redownloaded the app WITH my account they said I DIDNT PURCHASE IT?!?!?!?!? Yet it’s clearly stated in my bank history and Apple Purchase History???? Explain this to me!I love this app, I like the meal plans, the exercises, everything is great, but 4 days ago I started having problems with viewing my plan, and meal options, everything goes blank and it looks like if It’s downloading... only option is to delete the app, download it and sign in again, after doing this, the app works again, but data and history is gone... and this is happening every night...

Other thing that I think it will be very useful is if you could have more options for the measuring units when logging in your food, example: cups, tbs, and not only ounces, also to have the option of saving previous foods and choose from there, so you don’t have to type everything again, app saves a few or the last ones, but not all of them..

One more thing that it will be very helpful is that if your meal options could change and update when you change your meal plans.. Example: from 5 foods to 2 and snack, etc... right now you have to delete data, and start al over again...

I would give more stars but this problem of downloading and reloading every night is making me not to enjoy the app.I never agreed to a year subscription. And please don’t tell me it’s out of your hands. It has taken me 7 days of going through a million hoops via Apple and being told that I don’t qualify for a refund. I am very frustrated at Apple and at this app’s customer service. Look at my history (and I know someone at your company can). I did not use this app for one second. I remember seeing the free trial ad, starting to ask all the questions in the questionnaire and not being able to answer some questions so I stopped. I never completed it yet I still got billed for a YEAR!! If I could give this rating a zero, I would. I don’t have the money for this. If I was charged a month, fine, wouldn’t be happy but a year. I’m sorry, that is shady marketing.DO NOT BUY IT! This app is terrible and the money back guarantee is a lie! 
First of all, I originally had several small charges to my account (which was annoying). Then when I got into the meal plans, they only had keto available... which my cardiologist advised against considering my family history. I wrote them requesting my money back right away and they said if I wanted my money back I needed to submit before and after photos of myself showing no results on their program after 2 weeks. It said nothing about submitting photos next to their advertised money back guarantee. Only thing you are guaranteed is another weight loss gimmick that steals your money 😡Started and was on workout 8 and all my processes and badges were reset. Emailed support on Monday and have yet to hear back. After reading some reviews it seems to have been a common situation with several other users during the same time period. I was really enjoying the app and had planned to keep the app after my 28 day challenge but have since decided to cancel. I’ve told my friends about this app and recommended it to them and will be changing my story. Super disappointing.If you enjoy wasting your money this app is for you. Tried it out a while ago and ran into bugs and ultimately just gave up on it. Cancelled my renewal and low and behold that must have bugged out too… surprise surprise… so just got billed again and customer service is of no help whatsoever… saying it was never cancelled… long story short I’ve paid $80 for something I have never used and will never use… I’d steer clear of this one",0,Yesterday’s update wiped out my entire historyDON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!

App. After being a nurse for 42 years, I recently retired and trying to find an easy way to increase my at home activity. But my knees aren’t great.

When I’m working out, I usually only use the iPad, but would like to use my phone throughout the day for updates. HOWEVER, the phone and iPad are no syncing up. All the workouts I have completed on the iPad are not showing up on my phone. I use this app almost daily and the app on my phone still treats me like a new user. It has no recorded history of everything I’ve done. Also, it would be nice to be able to do the workout from my smart TV, the app isn’t available in the Google App Store on my tv. Which I guess doesn’t matter, because if the phone and iPad aren’t syncing, the tv wouldn’t sync to the iPad either. If this could be fixed, then the app would be perfect!!!I found this app and thought it was what I needed; however, it has been a let down. 

1. I have reached out to Customer support via chat TWICE and received ZERO response (says they will respond via email and, YES, I checked my spam/junk folder). 

2. The “keto” plan has suggested 160g of Carbs per day, 35g Fat, and 79g of protein. This is the complete opposite of the keto diet. The meal plan when selected says “I like low carb….” And says “not for those with diabetes, etc.” My husband’s doctor recommended the keto diet to him since he is at risk for diabetes based on family history, so these comments just don’t make sense. You may be thinking, well, can’t you adjust it in your head and eat less carbs? Absolutely! But, when I am paying for a service/program/app, it should work. 

3. The app will crash in the middle of entering any information. I have updated and it still happens on occasion. 

4. Some features are not user friendly or obvious to find. 

I really wish that customer support would have answered my questions and that I felt like their information presented was accurate.",0,It’s almost great.Needs to get Better,munkyluv717kduffy78,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,343,has_narrative,14

I am doing the 16hours intermittent fasting and amazed by the results in terms of weight loss! I honestly never imagined an app would keep me as motivated as I am today as I usually lose motivation when it comes to healthy cooking and prepping meals. This worked out well because It lets you select the time you want to spend prepping meals and the ingredients you prefer using, so the suggestions for the Keto plan I chose are working great with my schedule, similarly to the exercise portion of it. The only thing I wish was easier to do is the food tracking, I wish it had a feature to group food in a recipe so I can use it another day if I made this recipe again, also if it had a history of the most recent items I used or the ones I keep reusing. 
The last thing (and it’s not as important) but could be improved, is the ability to add fractions the your weight when you log in.I have been using withdrawals app from the beginning of my weight loss journey and it has helped me so much to keep up with my water intake, calories also workouts and healthy food options for you to try and story’s for you to read I love this app",0,Very Motivating!Love,Chaza85cheyenne12t,BetterMe Health CoachingBetterMe Health Coaching,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,242,has_narrative,14

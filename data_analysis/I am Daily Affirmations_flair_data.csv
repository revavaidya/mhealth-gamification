The chime for the alert when a positive message comes in is like ‚Äúcalm technology‚Äù it‚Äôs a sweet peaceful chime that you learn to recognize and instead of being another overwhelming alert text or marketing thing you feel a sense of comfort and joy when that sound come it. It reminds you to be more present in the moment and your day. So many time a message came in with just the right thing that I needed to read at a moment I truly needed it.

I love the fact that you can customize what they are centered around to make them more personal to you and what your are going/been though. Also the way you can like and share them on the app like a social media feed is really cool. Although I haven‚Äôt bought the premium membership the things it features are very nice and it can make the app even more personalized and self centering than it already is. I love that I can share affirmations and sayings to friends and family so it can help them out too! Truly an amazing app with and without the membership.I have been on the journey of aligning how I use my tech with my values, and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing having I am notifications throughout the day. 

It‚Äôs the only app that I allow to send me notifications because they truly contribute to my well-being; and when I pick up the phone to go and browse social media or something else, I love having I am reminded in front of me before anything else.

I love love love this app. And such beautiful themes and affirmations are so on point! 

Interestingly, I‚Äôve been thinking about creating tiles that are not affirmations, but just notes to self that I would want to randomly come up. For example, things like: ‚Äúyour grandmother adores you, she loves it when you give her a call‚Äù. Imagine seeing this notifications and then remembering to call your grandma :) I think that would be cool.I‚Äôve actually been dealing with depression lately and haven‚Äôt been getting enough sleep, I don‚Äôt have appetite, and I feel like I‚Äôm hopeless and as a 11 year old girl says this it makes her life feel ruined so by getting I AM it has really changed my life by socializing more and opening up to people, but having my own space and it is so very inspirational because I can tell the quotes really have some taste to them.  Would definitely recommend!Trust me, best motivational app by far! I allow the app to send me multiple affirmations throughout the day (shows on my Lock Screen) I love how you can also customize the graphics (font, background, etc)I you can even share some affirmations straight to your social media stories! Don‚Äôt think about it any longer just download it right now! You wont be sorry! 

**i am not affiliated with this app, this is a real and honest review!I look forward to my affirmation notifications every day. I also like to scroll through the app whenever I‚Äôm feeling particularly down. It‚Äôs a good alternative to social media because it still has that ‚Äúscrolling feed‚Äù feel to it, but it‚Äôs a positive experience! 

Plus the app has great customization options for not only the app appearance, but the widget appearance and the app icon! I also appreciate that a majority of these customizations are free.I am a Social Worker and I heard about this app early on and wanted to check it out for myself first, before I referred people.
The App is FANTASTIC! I love that there are various topics of affirmations, I love that you can edit/change and SAVE the affirmations. I am a strong believer in affirmations and that if you continue with them, you can change your thoughts. This app is a GREAT tool to help people grow & remain committed to that process! Highly recommend!I use the banner notification for this app and set it to 8-12 affirmations each day as ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù generously pours gifts of tenderness, connection & power that feel personal and have me glowing from within! I cherish ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù and frequently recommend it! Not only that but I literally experience lovely, charismatic people recommending it to me often too! If you would like to be relevant, this app is ESSENTIAL! üíßThis app is great for staying positive. I put the reminders on my lock screen and they change throughout the day. It really helps me look on the brighter side of things and helps me stay grateful. Being a teenage girl, (17) sometimes going on social medias can really affect my mental health. But the first thing i see when i open my phone is a cute reminder. I just love this app. 10/10.I have major social anxiety and depression and sometimes I get so overwhelmed I can‚Äôt function. But having these notifications that I can set to my specific issue in that time help me breathe a little better. It‚Äôs important to give your efforts a little acknowledgement . Great app and I wish I found it sooner !This app has helped me sooo much since downloading!!! I love getting new affirmations all day ü§©!!! I share them on all my social media platforms!!! I get loads of love from them!!! 

I wish that the affirmations were present tense because that‚Äôs the key üîë Believing you are ALREADY doing or being or seeing or feeling the way you want to feel etc.I really do love this app. Majority of the time quotes come right on time to either cheer me up or just confirmation on how great things are. Sometimes I‚Äôm feeling a little down and a quote just as short as ‚Äúyou are enough ‚Äú just helps to lift my spirits especially when you are not a very social person like myself.In case yo forget, these reminders will help if you simply read them aloud. Even if you don‚Äôt believe in the lonely. Say it a few times, see where it takes you. Go for it. Replace your social media notifications with daily reminders. Through it the day even. And see what your energy becomes. It‚Äôs life changing.Just want to say I appreciate the motivation. The constant reminders are very helpful throughout the day. Especially for me being a content creator. Having Multiple social media‚Äôs it‚Äôs nice to know all I have to do is check my notification fir a positive reminder. I am a money magnet.ü§ëüß≤I don‚Äôt usually spend money on apps but this is one I‚Äôm glad I did. Every day I am surrounded by negativity on social media, work, etc. this has gone a long way in improving my self esteem and giving me more confidence. After the free trial I was sold.As a licensed clinical social worker, I look for apps to recommend to my patients/clients. This is the best affirmation app I‚Äôve seen. It is simple and not verbose. The affirmations which display throughout the day ground me. It is crucial for my mental health too!I‚Äôve only had it for a couple days, but it‚Äôs made my mornings so much better. Instead of waking up and going on social media, I go to read some affirmations. It‚Äôs a very beautiful app.I‚Äôve been testing out this app for almost six months.  I find it very useful and will be suggesting it to other members of my socialization group.  
I think this is a great help to motivating most 
Anyone but especially anyone diagnosed with low self esteem.This app is so good and I 10 out of 10 recommend it it has been helping me with my notes and helping me with my social anxiety and everythingThe continual affirmations are shifting my anxious unsettled brain to positive and calm.  As I receive them I am less prone to mindless social media visits, as I pause and meditate on each one. Much better dopamine hit than anything in SM!Somehow the affirmations and sayings are not personal enough and often miss the connection to current happenings but they always hit the spotOk love these saying I‚Äôd love if I could share them on social media but I do enjoy the app and coming up on my watch every day and making positive quotes.",1,Avery fleischmanChenuryatka1rose mary 1234567890Bunny1104hciwnic1suuzyqDustie JoMarialaico123TamberWyndMemefitz1987brownskinGtwiddledthumbsCoach WebberLafe12432ShauDen2011Anavi_inp2tll4uilikemymombecausesheiscoolAnnursenatan71BrendyStewart,It‚Äôs truly a great appFinally an app with notifications that add to my lifeInspirational!‚ùóÔ∏èA MUST HAVE APP‚ùóÔ∏èThis app is lovelyI AffirmHigh Value EssentialLove itAffirmations when I need them mostiAm. impressed!!!Love this app!Remember who you are!Elevated Thought$üß†Positive ReinforcementBest affirmation app I‚Äôve seenBeautiful appTherapyInspirational appShifting my thinkingAlmost greatI am app,I am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily AffirmationsI am Daily Affirmations,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,1346,has_social,23

I feel like they help in the beginning to identify what is happening, but over time it just felt like a regular reminder that I was down and at a certain point that stops being helpful. I‚Äôm not severely depressed  - just another person struggling with the roller coaster of life over the last few years. We own a stressful business, separated from my wife, then later found out I had cancer. Therapy helps a bunch, but when my therapist took a break for maternity leave I was on my own and needed some help. 

I decided to try this app instead of another mood tracker, and I am so glad I did. I can customize the categories of affirmations I receive and how often they pop up. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how helpful it is to have some positive words show up on my Apple Watch just when I needed it. If I had one suggestion for the developers it would be to create a category specific to cancer patients. Most of the messages are great, but having incurable cancer means my health is literally failing so messages that remind me that I should be grateful for my health are not negative, but also not necessarily helpful. Otherwise this a great app. Very easy to set up and I hope it helps you as much as it‚Äôs helped me so far‚Ä¶",0,COdogman,Try it,I am Daily Affirmations,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,242,has_tracking,4

I was feeling a little down nowadays but I downloaded this app and I knew I was someone and something. I knew I was a good person.

The app also makes some very strange decisions, often rating low and then replacing good foods with ones that are much less healthy but have better ratings (ex: recommending my protein bar with 21g of protein and 190cal that has 2g of sugar and a small amount of additives [according to the app it claims that the bar has 220cal] be replaced with a bar that is 20 points higher but has 210cal, 12g of protein, and significantly higher amounts of sugar and salt [13g of sugar, 260mg of salt]).

I would recommend adding a ‚ÄúRate this app‚Äù somewhere within the app to bump up your 5 star ratings, it would also be helpful for users to submit ideas/feedback to help you make the app even better. Free labor force, use it :)

One thing I would love to see is the ability to put in diet restrictions. For example if I‚Äôm celiac and also allergic to other things, I could put those into my profile. Then as I start scanning food items, you guys could warn me if it contains something I‚Äôm allergic to. My sister is the one that‚Äôs celiac and it‚Äôs always difficult to buy her snacks and food because I‚Äôm always worried about buying the wrong thing. She is more careful since she deals with it everyday, but I don‚Äôt have any idea since I could basically eat a shoe and be totally fine. I would definitely use that feature if I had it, when picking up snacks at the store.

Cheers!What I like:
- it explains everything in a way that even people not an expert in nutrition or chemical field can understand easily. 
- the database is huge that I can almost find everything so far. 
- user interface is cute and color tone is also very nice that I enjoy using it.

What I wish to be improved:
- Taiwan is not supported to use it. What a pity! Cosmetics and life style are super trending in Taiwan now. Please support it soon 
- When sending mail within App, it requires iOS user to use default Apple mail app. I use gmail all the time and I don‚Äôt want to re-install Apple mail only to send the feedback/report problem. Please support send message via installed mail app or within app directly.

Your work is truly appreciated and NEEDED today! I am telling everyone about your app and spreading it on social media. Thank you again for creating this! Everything we do can make this world a better place if what we do is for the good of ourselves and for the good all! It‚Äôs so important to bring awareness! Bless you!!i‚Äôve always been extremely cautious about what I put into an on my body I tried looking up certain words I see ingredients that I know aren‚Äôt natural and I would have to figure out if it is safe one by one. this app put everything right in front of your eyes it explains every single ingredient in detail and also let you know in a clear and simple way how much of a risk it is for your health (good, low risk, moderate risk) and also says out of 100 how healthy it is for your body. i‚Äôve been wanting to write in a journal every ingredient I can find and if they are bad for you but now I can just pull it up on my phone whenever I need to know! this app is amazing and I truly do hope that they get more subscribers. I will definitely be promoting it on my social media‚Äòs more people need to be aware of the benefits from this appü§çI saw people using this app on social medias and since im trying to be more conscious about what i pit on and in my body this app has been my best friend when im out shopping and has encouraged me to read the labels more often and on my own!
I highly recommend this app for multiple reasons, it could lower the chances of harsher chemicals being used in our everyday products if there sales go down and hopefully help companies stop cutting so many corners. 
In order to have good works you need healthy workers! So be more consious of your body and take care of it‚ù§Ô∏è It will thank you in the long run.
Also not only products but making your own diy products made of natural ingredients will cut down costs and skin issues and intestinal issues. Reading lables of healthier products will give you a good example of what ingredients to buy!After hearing it recommended on social media, I decided to download Yuka to try it for myself. Honestly this app is a huge eye-opener! 

Naturally, after I downloaded the app I went around my kitchen and bathroom scanning my food/makeup. I was horrified to learn that so many of the ""organic"" and ""cleaner"" options were just as bad, if not worse, than the regular products! (This would also explain a lot of my allergy issues!) 

I like that it offers healthier alternatives that arw similar to what you were already using. Plus it's super comforting to know exactly what you're putting into your body. This is definitely something I would reccommend trying and keeping in your phone.I found this app through a facebook page I follow to try and be healthier and I am amazed but shocked at the same time more people dont know about this app! EVERYONE should know about this app. I have been telling all of my friends and family about it because everyone deserves to know what they are putting into their bodies and I love how this is an independent app so no greedy people trying to make money off of it for their own personal gain.

The basis of this app seemed to be confusing to me because I did not understand how they were ascribing these ‚Äúscores‚Äù to food products. I looked on the website and found that they use a nutritionist who is French to review their sources. I have not been able to find any related education, and I know that the term nutritionist is not regulated in the US. Registered dietitians is the only term that can be regulated.I went ahead and downloaded the app, and found that many of the articles that are sourced from companies and organizations with bias. And they claim not to have bias? So that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Many of the articles had even been taken down, and some were not even peer reviewed.. So please take this information with a grain of salt. The demonization of preservatives and processed foods for no reason needs to stop, especially when they are causing people to have unhealthy relationships with food.First of all, if you use this app to determine what you consume or what products you use, then you probably don‚Äôt eat or use anything.

Yuka will mark safe ingredients such as preservative (which are literally needed to keep products safe and usable) as moderate risk or hazardous. And in food, they will mark sodium or sugar as hazardous (which obviously it‚Äôs not healthy in high amounts but definitely nowhere near hazardous????)

This app doesn‚Äôt consider percentages in cosmetics or skincare so they just slap ‚Äúhazardous‚Äù on everything if the resource they used concluded that the ingredient might be unsafe in very high concentrations, even if it‚Äôs harmless in concentrations used. It‚Äôs very over exaggerated and inaccurate‚Ä¶

Maybe the app is not bad if you don‚Äôt look at product scores, or for people who have very specific diets, but scores and safety markings are trash and completely inaccurate and random.I‚Äôve been into nutrition for years and I‚Äôve used many apps for tracking food, finding alternative foods to ones that aren‚Äôt as healthy. This app CLAIMS it will do that, however it doesn‚Äôt. It misleads and conflicts with other very reliable apps which are backed by doctors and nutritionists. I deleted Yuka after four days of use. Not only was it inaccurate, but many foods are missing.I‚Äôm working on my dietitian degree and when someone in my family started using this app, I checked it out. 

To be blunt, the recommendations are terrible and make no sense. High sugar, highly processed foods are recommended and score higher the low or no sugar foods. And there seems to be an extreme weighting towards sodium content over everything else.

Do not use this app if you care about your healthAs someone who was way ahead of this curve i was so excited to see an app like this. Sadly, if you use this YOU WILL GET SICK AND DEVELOP DISEASE. 
An app that recommends synthetic sugars(sugar free).. No!!!! It scores everything poorly that contains 1g or sugar or salt.

I was looking at granola cereals. I scanned Purely Elizabeths berry crisp, ancient grain granola to which Yuka attributed a poor score (too much saturated fat and too much sugar 7 g). I should add that all the ingredients in Purely Elizabeth are organic. They use coconut oil, which is a medium chain fatty acid, recognized as one of the better type of fat to consume.

Instead, it suggested that I buy Quaker Simply Granola which is non-organic and contains 13 g of sugar per servings compared to 7 g for P.E. - and a bunch of nasty seed oils such as canola and soybean.

So maybe this is just a glitch. But at the moment I am underwhelmed.It‚Äôs a fine app, but if you want to use it to determine the safety of something, you can‚Äôt go by the health score. It takes into account many dieting factors like sugar and calories, which I would assume most people would already be aware of. I‚Äôve had foods with no dangerous additives labeled as ‚Äúbad‚Äù and given very low health scores, simply because they had ‚Äútoo many calories‚Äù for the generic person they thought might be eating them. Makes the app more difficult to use than it should be, but the concept is there.Arizona fruit punch is scoring as ‚Äúgood‚Äù when it contains high fructose corn syrup as the second ingredient. One week a hair product scored a ‚Äúbad‚Äù 0 for harmful/hazardous additives and scored ‚Äúgreat‚Äù the next week. Now the app doesnt list all the ingredients. It was much better before!! It was a full 5 stars!! Not sure when it changed. It was so helpful before to learn what to look out for and figure out whats important to you. Not anymore. :(So I was loving being able to use the free scanner, which made everything seem legit, but when I paid for it, and was able to search products, you would get multiple different scores with the same product! I don't trust it now.Scanned a shampoo that is known to be without bad ingredients and it came up rated poor. It listed an ingredient phenoxyethanol that isn‚Äôt even a listed ingredient on the bottle. Then another scan of a body wash that scored excellent with FRAGRANCE in the ingredient list. Misleading app!These can contain up to 3000 ingredients, so I‚Äôve read.  Ingredients which they don‚Äôt have to disclose to us.

The app also assumes that for example, salt is bad for you. As a ranch hand for a while I understand how dumb of a statement that is.

Because of all of this, I use the app purely for looking into additives and chemicals, and not for nutritional advice, which an app like this should focus on anyway, because different people need different nutrients, and lots of people are turning to different lifestyle diets to accomplish their goals which according to this app are very unhealthy. (For example I exclusively eat beef, butter, dairy, broccoli, and Diet Pepsi üòÇ)I think it‚Äôs cool that this app alerts you to potentially harmful additives‚Ä¶ but the fact that a product gets a poor score based on fat content is one thing based on old ideas. It is metabolically healthier to eat cheese than carb-loaded Triscuits, yet this app is suggesting them as a replacement ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs also telling me that 1.5 tbsp of one thing is too caloric (40 calories), but that 1 tbsp of another thing is calorically ideal (120 calories ‚Äî like, huh?). 
Ideally, the app would have controls where users can set the type of diet/lifestyle they lead (i.e. keto, paleo, SAD), so that scores are more personally accurate.When I scanned an item that is poor, I chose to try their recommendations on the bottom which have great scores. Then I scan the recommendations and they end up also having poor scores. This has happened multiple times and therefore I feel like I can no longer trust Yuka. So sad because I was happy to have an app that can help me stay away from bad chemicals.I can scan products and see how they score, but the other functions aren‚Äôt working.

My recommendations to make this app even better is to add ‚ÄúFragrance‚Äù into scoring, as we know that there could be many different chemicals under the label ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù. I think this app could be a lot more informative too by being able to click on all the ingredients and not just some. Although they may not be harmful, it would still be nice to know what they are. I also have found many products that I was unable to search or scan. Maybe make it so you can request a score for a product that isn‚Äôt listed? Like I said above, I thoroughly like this app and really like how it gives recommendations and alternatives.I absolutely love this app as it gives me the ability to check what is in the food I eat very quickly while in the store.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because occasionally I will get conflicting results. (one example that I just scanned is  Tostitos scoop, multi grain chips) I scanned, and it said good, a friend of mine scanned on her Yuka app and she got negative score ‚Äì so mine was green and hers was actually orange or red (I can‚Äôt remember).  I‚Äôve had this happened a couple of times. So hopefully they will be a little more strict about what people upload in the future.  But all in all this is a FANTASTIC app and I recommend it highly!I love this app so much I have a premium subscription to support them. I have a few suggestions that would make this app perfect for me:
- let us look up ingredients by one or a whole list, not just products. 
-let us choose our own grading system, for example I don‚Äôt care about allergens and sometimes it‚Äôs the only thing bringing down a product‚Äôs score. 
-let us make ‚Äúcollections‚Äù for our saved/favorite items.Great app! Consider changing the way you frame calories, as many nutritious foods are naturally high in calorie and fats (olive oil). Perhaps instead of labeling these foods that would have otherwise scored higher as having a ‚Äúhigh amount of healthy fat‚Äù or simply stating calorie/fat amounts without a rating of good/bad. 

Actually, I feel that rating of food should be heavily based on carcinogenic ingredients/sourcing methods/emission levels. Nutrition is so subjective and the factors listed above are of more importance in the long run.Very useful app, you scan a product and it tells you about the good & the bad in it. Plus if the score is low on an item it gives you a recommendation. My only issued with this app is that I encountered a product with erroneous information and I‚Äôve tried to upload the ingredient list but it doesn‚Äôt let me fix the information.I love that this app lets you scan current things you have around the house or even if you scan it at the grocery store, but I wish that you were able to search for the product and see it‚Äôs score/recommendations without having to scan it.This app is absolutely amazing in every way and will change the rating to 5 stars if they ever add the tracking of seed oils in the food as well, it would be very beneficial to see seed oils factored into the products overall health score and alert you as to whether or not the product contains any.I wish it took in to account inflammatory oils and dyes.

This app makes it so easy to break down whats in a product so easily. ive shown everyone i know and even paid for the premium version. (this app is consumer funded. company's do not pay them to say their product is this or that) me being superstitious compared what the app said to what the label of ingredients said and its always right. 
i know the app is still fairly new and the interface and features it offers outside of just listing ingredients and letting you know if there bad then offering recommendations it doesn't do a whole lot more. I like that it keeps of history of barcode scans, i wish it had a feature to incorporate online shopping. Me personally i dont shop alot in stores and without a physical barcode it makes buying things online still risky. so that could be a cool feature. As well as creating like brands and like ranking them by a collective of what their product scores are. I love this idea of putting the power back in the consumers hands though. knowledge is power, and it starts with our daily habits to really see change. THANK YOU!I was introduced to this App by my daughter-in-law; we both were working on becoming more ‚Äúorganic‚Äù in our choices. This App is so easy to use, yet so revealing that we filled a garbage can with food and cosmetics that were filled with hazardous ingredients. 

It is very revealing to find the number of hazardous elements that are allowed in, not only our cosmetics, but in our food! I was appalled. But Yuka gives us quite a variety of healthy and safe alternatives to replace the items that we threw away. Now we are familiar with the healthy brands and can build a relationship with them. 

I never would have know that certain additives were harmful, even banned by other countries, that are allowed in the products we use in the U.S. So you will not regret downloading this App. All you have to do is scan the barcode on makeup, soap, and foods of every kind to find out if they score Bad-Poor-Good or Excellent. 

On a humorous note, my son scanned my bottle of Jack Daniels whisky and Yuka‚Äôs response was, ‚ÄúWe do not rate alcohol. But you know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù  We laughed about that for an hour!

I highly recommend Yuka. It will rate your product, give you recommendations and explain what is good or bad about the one rated. Spread the word!I strongly believe In what the developers of this app are doing.
Transparency and non-biased information on products and food without monetary gain is so needed in todays world. 
Green labels are being slapped onto everything and boxes are being made to look more health conscious which can be deceiving to consumers, this app cuts through all of that and gives scientific information on why a ingredient is listed the way it is, a score for easy comprehension and alternatives!
I bought the premium app just so I could support this idea, even if just a small amount.
You‚Äôre appreciated!This is an amazing app, tells you what you are eating and it gives it a score of how harmful it may be. It can even scan beauty products and I just found out every skincare item I‚Äôm using is bad for my skin. This app is amazing and it even tells you an alternative list to compare to what you are currently using. Only thing is that you do have to be a member to search items instead of having to scan them, although the lowest option is 8.99/yearly which is amazing! Highly recommend this app!I‚Äôm a time where companies have gotten off track with what products can contain be it excessive salt or sugar or even dangerous additives, Yuka is essential. Give a good quick overview of the Product you scan and even offers alternative products that are better for you. If your someone who is looking to lose or maintain weight it‚Äôs really good. Scan the item you want eat, get the score and check alternatives. I‚Äôve switched from countless products that scored under 20 to ones that now score 80+. This is my go to app at the grocery store.This app literally changed my life for the better. Getting better products for my hair and body is so much harder than you think but not with this app it makes it easy and it also give you recommendations!!!!  For similar products!! 

This app also works the same way with food you scan something you love and it come up with a bad score well here are some healthy options it‚Äôs amazing this is a game changer!!! 
  
Thank you so much for this app!!!!a complete game changer when it comes to personal health. as a person who was 210 lbs one year ago to now 160 pounds. this app gives that last piece of the puzzle when it comes to health. being able to see hazardous additives along with a overall health score makes my personal fitness goals so much easier! i‚Äôll be looking like ronnie coleman thanks to Yuka!I‚Äôve been using this app for only 5 days and it is already proving so useful! It allows me to find the nutritional info of pretty much any product! And if it isn‚Äôt on there, you can add it to the crowdsourced database. It‚Äôs so cool and fascinating. Also, the app assigns a so-called ‚Äúscore‚Äù to each product that rates how healthy it is. It makes the work to find healthy foods so simple. üëçI‚Äôve been using the App now for about 6 months. This App may not have changed my life but made it very easy for me to shop for healthy foods and drinks. I can just aim at the barcode and get a score instead of trying to read the whole label. 
I will definitely recommendI‚Äôm glad I found this app! It‚Äôs very informative by letting you know what harmful ingredients are in your food and beauty products. I especially like the recommendations it gives for products that scored bad. Totally recommend this app if you are looking to avoid harmful ingredients in your food and beauty products.I honestly didn‚Äôt know all the things that aren‚Äôt good for me in my house!!! When you first download you start scanning almost anything you can find! I also like they give recommendations for the items with a bad score. I am recommending this app for sure!They are the BEST app for scanning products to see the clean-ness. They scale the product out of 100 and explain why based on the products ingredients they have that score. 

Biggest plus is that they give UNBIASED recommendations for alternative products based on the INGREDIENTS and not based on marketing/ partnerships.This is the greatest free app that I have ever used. It‚Äôs so easy to use, and it gives suggestions for healthy alternatives, when a product scores poorly! I have discarded so many products that were really bad and replaced them with healthy alternatives.This is really an awesome App! And everyone should have it. Now every time I buy something I check Yuka score.Product detail/score is a helpful tool. Scanning grocery receipts would be a nice addition.This app rates cosmetic products and foods based on the risk their ingredients pose to our health.

Not just that, they also updated all my history search, so they probably don‚Äôt get sued by bunch of people for false information etc.

This app makes it so easy to break down whats in a product so easily. ive shown everyone i know and even paid for the premium version. (this app is consumer funded. company's do not pay them to say their product is this or that) me being superstitious compared what the app said to what the label of ingredients said and its always right. 
i know the app is still fairly new and the interface and features it offers outside of just listing ingredients and letting you know if there bad then offering recommendations it doesn't do a whole lot more. I like that it keeps of history of barcode scans, i wish it had a feature to incorporate online shopping. Me personally i dont shop alot in stores and without a physical barcode it makes buying things online still risky. so that could be a cool feature. As well as creating like brands and like ranking them by a collective of what their product scores are. I love this idea of putting the power back in the consumers hands though. knowledge is power, and it starts with our daily habits to really see change. THANK YOU!I really enjoy utilizing this app when i‚Äôm at the grocery store and picking out the best option for myself. This app is very helpful in telling you why they rate an item negatively and positively and it‚Äôs so simple and straight to the point that I can use that rating to my own discretion. Whether I say no all together on that specific item and look through the app‚Äôs recommendations of a similar more positively rated item or want to read through and accept that ‚Äúyeah maybe it is too sweet but oh well, as long as there aren‚Äôt any seed oils and additives‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll accept it,‚Äù it depends on my mood or the item i‚Äôm looking at entirely. I really appreciate this app and how simple and easy it is to use and choose where it matters most. I also love that there is a scanned history for all the old items you‚Äôve scanned before that you can refer back too! I really am enjoying this app, excited for any beneficial updates. I haven‚Äôt used the app for that long yet for any suggestions at the moment.A coworker told me about Yuka and I immediately downloaded it to my phone. It just so happened that I was making a grocery store run later in the day. I used the app to help me make some better choices in products. I went home and checked out my shampoos and lotions, oh my! I appreciate the recommendations that are provided when products rate poorly.  And it was fun to discover that I have made some very good product choices. I think I will find this app even more helpful when I want to try a new product but am unsure if it is really as good as they make it out to be. Also, it keeps a history of the items you have scanned so you can go back and reference them at anytime. 

If you are wondering if the products you are buying are as good as they claim, this app is for you!I‚Äôm not even kidding when I say this app changed and potentially saved my life. Since I learned about the insane amount of chemicals and toxins being used in beauty products and foods, I immediately downloaded this app so I knew exactly what I was using on my body and consuming. Now I‚Äôve never been healthier, and the app is already so useful without the premium subscription. It gives me recommendations to use instead of other harmful products, and it has a history tab so I never lose track of all the foods and beauty/self care products I‚Äôve read about. Like I said, amazing app. I‚Äôve already had 5 different friends of mine download it and love it. I‚Äôve never felt safer about what I‚Äôm buying until now.I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this app. It is so well thought out from a very realistic perspective. Before being introduced to this app from an Ulta employee, I never realized how many  toxins were in the make up of various products. It is no wonder why cancer & other health issues are so prevalent. As a consumer with no scientific degree or medical knowledge this is such a User Friendly app that is not only comprehensive, but goes to the next level of recommending better products or food items & then is also gives you a history of what items you have scanned for your own personal reference. 
I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about YUKA!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI‚Äôm thoroughly thought I was Eating Healthy Good Food. Being a Truck Driver by Day, cycling 75 miles weekly! Having Little Time to Read the back of every item, then when you Do, there‚Äôs still ingredients, not listed!
Premium Membership includes Search Engine box, History, works offline , once a connection is restored it updates what was not included to your History. INDEPENDENT -no big Brother-
Game Changer!  Why haven‚Äôt you Downloaded it Already?This app is going to replace Fooducate for me! I love that the recommended alternatives are all decent instead of the former app where it shows you C‚Äôs and D‚Äôs. I love the way the information is displayed where I‚Äôm interested in seeing if a product has negative additives etc. The scan history and recommended tab are fantastic too! I‚Äôm looking forward to the annual pricing to support a great product.This app has changed so much for me but I need to review because I discovered a cool feature today. If someone else scans an item and shared it with you, that item is added to YOUR history. I love that!!! Now my family and friends can share excellent products with me and it‚Äôs saved for me to refer to later! Love it so much!It shocks me what is marketed as healthy in our stores but when scanned it tells a different story. I am making healthier choices for myself with the help of This app!! It‚Äôs laid out in an easy to understand way. Thank you!!!!I just became a premium member and I love the quick and easy scan for products. I‚Äôm already finding out that products I thought were healthy were not. Just reading the ingredients on the label doesn‚Äôt tell the entire story. In seconds all of the information is there including hidden additives. 

I heartily recommend this App to anyone who is concerned with eating well and using products that are not harmful. 

Thanks to the developers for a truly great app!
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èI love this app. Totally worth it. I thoroughly enjoy the story behind how this app came to be, and I hope they never change or become sellouts. Thank you to the family that made this app.It‚Äôs as if the Yuka team read my mind and made a reality. The ease of use, explanations, scoring, history, all of it. What an amazing tool.Recommendations are super easy and they aren‚Äôt pushing any products for sale. 

I love the history, ability to favorite, and that a referral gives you premium service. 

I took it to the grocery store and it helped inform decisions so fast!

I would love if ‚Äúhigh carb‚Äù or ‚Äúketo‚Äù can be in food preferences.

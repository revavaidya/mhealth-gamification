For example, I am using this app on an iPhone 11, and one friend of mine runs it on an iPhone 7. His app has a ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù section where I suppose he can do challenges with those he‚Äôs connected with.

Hope you keep improving.I have been using sweat coins for about a week and a half. It motivates me to walk more trying very hard to reach the top of the goal every day.

According to heathview I walked 117,000 this month so far and Sweatcoin says I walked like 45,000 steps. Not accurate at all. I would not pay money for this app. The incentives are junk unless you meet the challenges (which you won‚Äôt meet because they are not accurate) and the digital offers and physical offers you can mostly find for free online anyway. I should also include that I turned background app refresh off and on again with no results. I do most of my walking at home doing chores going up and down the stairs. I don‚Äôt always walk vast distances outdoors. A lot of my waking is back and forth within my house. I am running iOS 16 if that is relevant to anyone. Another update: I tried doing an active 4 mile walk to see what would happen in the app, it registered about 4000 steps when I walked about 8700 active steps. Wacked outIt honestly isn‚Äôt worth it. This is my second time using this app it hopes that it was upgraded over the years. Sadly it is the exact same. 1st, it really cheats you out of steps. As everyone complains about that issue. I walk daily 3-4 miles also adding in my steps for just normal day to day activities I average around 10-11,000 steps. The app only counted 2,000 of them as actual steps. The algorithm is awful. The developers most common response is to update the app. Obviously the updated version has not corrected that problem at all. 2nd, the purchase items are not at all for only coins earned but also requires actual cash for shipping that is way overpriced. And lastly. Any decent rewards are offered through challenges that is nearly impossible to reach within the time frame. I would suggest not wasting your phones storage space with downloading this app.UPDATE: Deleting app. The fact my review has not been posted shows complete ignorance by the developer and I will not support a company that can not support people with Chronic Illnesses. 

NOTE: I've submitted this review MULTIPLE TIMES. Somehow it still has NOT appeared in App storeüßê Why? What are you hiding? 

Really do NOT like the new format for Daily Boost. It sets its own goal. Ignoring what you have set for yourself. And pushes you to walk faster. This isn't supportive of people like myself who have a chronic illness and walking may be our only way to exercise. Just being on our feet may be difficult some days due to pain or other symptoms like vertigo, trouble breathing, etc. And we set goals that are attainable with challenges of our conditions. To have SweatCoin seem to not be considerate of chronic health is very disappointing. The company should be positive toward ALL users regardless of their current health status, ability, etc.First I had this app for a while now I have a bit of sweat coin but I can‚Äôt even spend it. Every time I go to the marketplace it always says sold out. Next the bugs, I can‚Äôt even get on the app anymore because it keeps crashing, I need to reinstall the app for it to work for a little bit. Then my challenges, right now u can win a 100 dollar adidas card but I can‚Äôt win it because the step counter isn‚Äôt going up ( IS STILL AT 0). I don‚Äôt recommend this app if your looking for free stuff, but is really good motivation if u need to lose weight.I‚Äôve been a long time user, was even a Premium user for a year. I do all the monthly challenges and get the required 250,000 steps to be entered. So I‚Äôm actually active on the app. 

App used to be great. But now, none of the physical products are available. And all the online offers are subscriptions that are available everywhere, so they aren‚Äôt really a deal. And, I‚Äôm still waiting on 3 items I bought a year ago from offers on this app to arrive. And I wonder, when you donate money to the causes on here, does it really go to those causes?I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm done with the excessive push notification. I‚Äôm done with the dark design ‚Äúcoin challenges/contests‚Äù that have you open the app and be forced to interact before you can read the directions to know what to do only to find out you‚Äôve done the wrong thing. I‚Äôm done with none of my steps/movement being counted.

It went through fine when I changed it to a smiley face‚Ä¶.hmmm. So basically I signed up for it a few years ago seeing if I could get something back for the steps I was doing. At the time they would occasionally post some Apple products (from big big points accumulating, but fair enough) along with some little $5 things and some 50% off things. I don‚Äôt mind being marketed to in a free app as long as they‚Äôre providing value to me. Maybe the paid version has more, but I‚Äôm not here to buy things I‚Äôm here to trade an activity for goods at the cost of being marketed to. Now it‚Äôs nothing but free trials and coupons after years of steps. Don‚Äôt waste your time, they don‚Äôt want to use those dollars the marketers are paying them to make it a remotely valuable experience for users. I don‚Äôt even trust they‚Äôre properly donating from the ‚Äúdonation‚Äù section of purchases. The fake feedback was what disgusted me enough to make a public review- if you‚Äôve built an app that so bad you won‚Äôt even take feedback within the app, I guess I‚Äôll just have to post publicly.I went to purchase these air pods and it continually told me it was out of stock, after constantly reloading the app, still not able to purchase while it still said the air pods 
 available. If there truly is nothing to be done, I‚Äôm just going to delete my account at this point and tell everyone what a waste this app really is. I‚Äôm active and would walk whether this existed or not. The reason I do this app is because I am low income and thought this would be a great way to have some small wins in the world where I‚Äôm stuck walking because of an accident. I have been using the app for over two years, and haven‚Äôt really spent any of the coins. What they offer in the store is mainly digital offers, donations, or things you get a partial discount on. You see a nice physical product for free that‚Äôs up for grabs? Nope. In reality, this will be just another pointless app where I fed in to it for years and now realize that it doesn‚Äôt do much but take up GB usage on my phone. There was a guarantee in the event a purchase was out of stock, so where is my $? Considering I have screenshots that I should have been able to use these points. One of the many many disappointments this app leads to. Don‚Äôt waste your time.I downloaded this app a few years ago and never really used it. The rewards were out of my point range and it was a slow process earning points so I never bothered. Started walking more about a year and a half ago so started accruing lots of points daily. Problem is I check the rewards almost daily and have never seen any gift cards that aren‚Äôt sold out. There are a few options to buy discounted jewelry or other items I‚Äôm not interested in purchasing or links to memberships and subscriptions I could get directly from the vendor and skip the middle man. 
There is no actually reward I will ever be able to attain so it is a waste of my time and use of my phone‚Äôs battery and storage. 
There are better apps that actually reward you for using the app. It‚Äôs ridiculous to spend over a year trying to spend the points you‚Äôve earned. Sweatcoin needs to figure out a way to make spending points fair for everyone but they haven‚Äôt so I‚Äôm deleting the app at the end of this month. I gave it a fair chance but would not recommend the app to anyone if they are hoping to actually be rewarded. ‚úåüèªFor the past four years while I've had this app installed, I've had a job as a walking field technician, spending every day walking the streets of Manhattan. Every day I would walk between 5 to 10 miles per day. After four years I have racked up enough points to get nothing more than what I'd likely get if I walked 0 miles. I've received nothing free, and the best I could attain with the points I've acquired are things like ""3 months free of Apple Music"", or other discounts that are likely available other places without walking every day. Although I always had faith that I'd eventually rack up enough sweatcoin points to get something cool, today I came to accept that this is all nonsense, that it's impossible to attain the amount of miles to get anything good, and that I'm finally going to delete this app because it's really just a marketing engine. There's no way anyone walks enough to get any of the ""free stuff"" flaunted in the marketplace of this app, take it from me, someone who walks at least a marathon per week. Shame on you, sweatcoin, for giving me false hope for the past four years.I thought this app was a great idea, BUTTTT it cheats you. I do the 2X boost and I ran 1,600 steps annnnnddddd it only gave me 104! Steps! Are. You. Kidding. Me!!! It said 1,600 steps then when it ‚Äúcalculated‚Äù my steps to 2X it, it only gave me 104. I‚Äôm in disgust with this app. Do not get it, it‚Äôs a waste of your time. They didn‚Äôt want to give me 3,200 steps. How horrible to USE your customers. I‚Äôve been using this app for years hoping they would get more considerate but nope just a big joke. Very very unhappy, might just delete the whole app! I can‚Äôt believe I worked so hard to run 1,600 for them to give me 104!!! Can you even believe that????? It never calculates your steps right. Once it sees you‚Äôre on a roll on walking and running. The steps will ‚Äúfake glitch‚Äù so they can stop giving you steps. They know we can walk a lot & they don‚Äôt want to give us the money/rewards. It‚Äôs low key a scam. Also, the points are SOOO hard to get, take forever for you to win something. It‚Äôs an ongoing battle to get something as simple as a Audio book! 
The initial idea was great, just wish they would actually do what they say & not scam people.Sweat coin is not a very good app. It is very slow at counting your steps and even if you tried to get on a schedule of 10,000 steps a day it‚Äôs only going to count like 4000. But many people were interested because you actually get to buy stuff from getting enough sweat coins, but when I looked at the store the only stuff that was actually worth buying was really expensive stuff. Many of the cheap products were something like $10 off your next energy bill or a Music subscription but most people have that the only good stuff takes two years of getting sweat coins every day with a maxed out subscription of 60 sweat coins a month. I recommend getting an app like receipt hog because all you do is scan the receipt that you get from buying stuff and you get points in return that you use for gift cards because apps like that are way better. Do not install this app.

P.S. it says you get five sweat coins for every invite and so far I‚Äôve invited 13 people that have started playing with my invite and I haven‚Äôt gotten a single coin from iti'd give this app 0 stars if i could. it scams you on amount of steps you take and since i've been using it, it decided to make the points worth even less so it's harder to reach a goal. all of their items for purchase are all things you could get for free and only valid for first time users ie free delivery when you sign up for grub hub WHICH YOU GET ANYWAY so it literally makes you spend your coins for no reason. seriously don't waste ur time it's just for data collection and very sketchy! ive seen lots of people leaving similar reviews and the app is like ""no not sketchy ü•∫"" but why else r u pressured to keep it open in the background? it eats battery too. ridiculous that 2 years being a pedestrian (no car so yep i walk EVERYWHERE at least 10k steps+ every day) with 3k sweatcoins in 2 years.... yeah right. they're not gonna make it right tho. idk why y'all are rating 5 stars and then writing about all issues. rate it 1 star. get these people deleted. they respond to all reviews instead of fixing their crappy appI joined this app in hopes of earning one of the big items like a vacation or a new iPhone. I‚Äôm totally willing to be patient as I know it will be a while before I accumulate enough points for one, but I‚Äôve noticed that on the past few months the quality of prizes has really gone down. I absolutely hate the new auction system. A couple of months ago, 20,000 sweatcoins would earn you a vacation that was probably worth thousands of dollars. With the auction system, items that are worth $500 are being won for that many points. It‚Äôs really frustrating as I‚Äôve been on this app for years hoping to earn a big item eventually but it‚Äôs all been replaced with much less remarkable prizes. üòï

EDIT: dropped to one star for that developer review. I already told you that I don‚Äôt like the auction system. Don‚Äôt try to tell me it‚Äôs an ‚Äúupgrade.‚Äù I‚Äôm seriously considering giving up on this app after two full years of using it.I‚Äôve been using this app for the longest and I don‚Äôt remember it ever being this terrible. Every time I login to redeem my rewards it‚Äôs always mysteriously sold out. Even when it appears as available and I try to redeem my points for rewards and it still says sold out. They won‚Äôt let you redeem your points for anything it‚Äôs all pointless. Pretty sure there were never any prizes to begin with. They‚Äôre just using this app to track us and monitor our data. When I tell you there‚Äôs absolutely no point in having this app, I one hundred percent mean it. Even when I attempt to contact customer support I don‚Äôt ever get assistance , it‚Äôs always just a robot with an automated response that doesn‚Äôt answer my question at all. Going to delete my account and have them erase all my data so they can no longer continue to track and collect my personal information‚Ä¶. I advise you all to do the same.I had this app downloaded for about 2-3 months and checked it everyday to see if I had lots of points and If I could buy anything, unfortunately, no matter how long I let my points build up I NEVER got anything redeemed. I don‚Äôt care about %20 off Homegoods, I care about getting some money in the form of a gift card to get food or go shopping, and unless you know when the gift cards drop so you can buy them you won‚Äôt get squat.

If you wanted to use this app to make your life easier in the for of many subtle money collection apps then I wouldn‚Äôt use this one. This app is for joggers and racers who move far distances daily and also have the free time to check the gift card drops I guess. Because I walk all day for my job.The app was great, a real motivation to walk more and challenge yourself to max out your daily points earnings.  However, with the update, you‚Äôre no longer rewarded for any of your steps.  Very discouraging, losing the thousands of steps that you logged for the day.  They say they‚Äôre aware of the issue and give you ‚Äòsteps‚Äô on trying to fix it, by restarting your phone.   Or, reinstall the app if that doesn‚Äôt work.  Well, neither fixes the issue.  The items you can buy with your earnings are super expensive when the points that are given for your steps (when it actually works) aren‚Äôt much.  You can buy the first month of monthly subscription services, but that‚Äôs even expensive when it takes a while to earn the points to do so.  The good thing about the app is that it‚Äôs free.I used to love this app, and I talked my entire family into using it. However, since the latest update the app is broken, and personally unusable. 

Essentially the app keeps track of your steps, converts them into ‚ÄúStepcoins‚Äù which you can use to purchase items. Before the latest update these steps were tracked/verified via GPS. This was wonderful for outdoor walking, as well as any distance greater than a hundred feet or so, and I regularly made 10,000 or more steps. This was only a few thousand of from my Fitbit count, so I was happy. 

I purchased the subscription that allows me to earn more coins per day, and I was racking them up quickly. Then the new update hit, and I have been losing points each month as the app refuses to count my steps anymore. I  have tried reinstalling, fixing permissions, and leaving the app open 24/7. I am now making around 2,000 steps maximum, despite my Fitbit still recording 10k+. 

I don‚Äôt understand the need to change systems, and it has ruined the experience for me. I won‚Äôt be using the app until this is fixed, and I will continue to recommend people use other apps that keep better track of their steps.Previously, the only tangible direct exchange for points was a CHANCE to win a gift card from an extremely limited pool. Otherwise all you can get are promotional codes for free trials for services that you can easily just get free trials for, or coupons for varying amounts off of physical products or other subscriptions. Now there isn‚Äôt even the chance at a gift card unless you pay for the premium. I‚Äôve been using the app for months now, regularly hit the daily free max so I‚Äôm well over 1,000 points, and it got that high because there is nothing interesting to trade them for. If you‚Äôre just trying to encourage yourself to walk more, I implore you to do it with a different app. There are many others with actual rewards.I literally have a lot of points collected and every time I try to redeem it, all the ‚Äúgifts‚Äù or rewards are always out of stock. No matter what time of the day I check it‚Äôs out of stock. How am I ever going to redeem my points then? I lost all those chances of redeeming to get good gifts with my points and it always says out of stock. Something isn‚Äôt right . I literally check soo much in a day to see if it‚Äôs open slots gifts and they never have anything available. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to ever redeem my points‚Ä¶? Either add more so people have a chance too or fix it. Actually I read online a lot of people have this same issue. They said every time they check it‚Äôs always ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù. People think its either bots buying it or a scam.This app is stupid. It cheats you first of all on your steps. It also makes you pay shipping and everything I‚Äôve bought so far I haven‚Äôt been able to redeem and I can‚Äôt refund to get my points back. The pay with sweat coin offers don‚Äôt even matter. Everyday I check multiple times to try to buy something but it‚Äôs always sold out. All the other stuff is lame and even if I did want it I couldn‚Äôt get it. They need to get more useful things like online gift cards for more local stores. There‚Äôs also a random points limit that pops up every time I watch ads for points that doesn‚Äôt really effect anything but is just annoying. Honestly this app is just taking up space on my phone.After one week of installing it had ridiculous deals of earning an iphone XS or an apple watch that expires in less than a few days. It would take years/months to actually get enough points to win that prize. There‚Äôs rumors that this app steals your points after awhile. Not only that, everything that are the ‚Äúprizes‚Äù are all over priced cheap products from china that‚Äôd take awhile to ship. ALSO they have an additional shipping fee that‚Äôs like $12. This app also sells your information and makes your phone battery die faster. Do not download this app or buy anything from their shop because it‚Äôs all cheap junk.This app is a ripoff. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up and think that you‚Äôll be able to accumulate points & use them in exchange for actual quality items. It tells you that you get 100% off if you spend x amount of coins for say, a pair of earbuds but then charges you $13+ in shipping- you‚Äôre paying for the price of the item in shipping alone because most of the ‚Äúoffers‚Äù are for cheap mass produced items like the ones on Shein or Aliexpress that‚Äôll probably break before they even arrive months after the fact. If I could give 1 star I would. It also miscalculates your steps and of course conveniently gives you less points than you‚Äôre owed. Smh.You do all this walking, and get all these steps that convert in to sweat coins. The prizes are stupid, and you still have to pay for them and register your credit card. And then PAY ATTENTION because you will sign up for a subscription if you not careful. I have almost 500 sweatcoins and I minus well have 10 or 20 because ain‚Äôt nothing you can do with them. If your looking for an App to get Points and prizes sign up for *PK COINS*. They seem more realistic. Not advertising but just helping out folks that REALLY want to get paid for walking. If sweat coins at least offered gift cards I‚Äôll be happy but nope. They only offer subscriptions or 10 percent off whatever they advertising.I thought sweat coin was a big enough company that they would do some research about the products they list on their website. I used my points to redeem a mini humidifier that was free all I needed was to put in a card. So I get hit with 10$ shipping well the humidifier is originally 50$ so hey whatever I literally pay 10$ and this company that was listed on sweatcoin sends me a broken cheap SMALL humidifier. It was awful not only did it take a month to ship but it wasn‚Äôt even free. I‚Äôve had this app on my phone for many many years and I‚Äôve only ever redeemed for this humidifier and I still had to pay. Absolutely terrible I was literally scammedThis app was such a good idea and app when it came out! They made changes right around Christmas 2019 now everyday it tells you no rewards available at this time try again later so I guess you have to come back multiple times a day and pray it works who has time for that! So now you don‚Äôt get any daily points for your time!
I have a bunch points gonna see if I can use them somewhere somehow and then delete the app. I referred several people to this app it was a new idea and you got daily points plus what you walked when the app came out!  Since the changes 2019 I do NOT recommend this appAM I THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM?!!? I currently have more than enough for the prizes listed but every time I want something and click on it, it does not load the actual prize, therefore I cannot exchange my points for prizes. All I see is the loading icon and I have literally waited 30 minutes for it to load without any distractions. And yes I actually timed it. I tried connecting to different WiFi‚Äôs, I tried no WiFi, I tried restarting my phone, I turned off my phone and turned it back on, I tried just about everything. wasted my time and using this app. Big fat thumbs down. I wish I could give this app 0 stars just to be nice.Good idea, and really don‚Äôt expect to earn much for a free app by just walking BUT doing anything on this app is impossible.  
Once the Home Screen is open trying to earn bonus points (claim bonus offers) or even see if I can redeem any points for somethjng is impossible!  No matter what I click the screen just goes idle and eventually just boots me out of the app.   I have no clue what rewards are available, how much I need to have in coins to redeem.  All I can ever access is my Home Screen!    I‚Äôve deleted and redownloaded this three times already and still the same crap!This could honestly be a good app. But it doesn‚Äôt always register your steps, which is...whatever. But these prizes? Actual trash. I‚Äôve been using quite awhile now in the hopes that something good will go up...it never does. They have ‚Äúwow‚Äù prizes like $1k and a smart phone but they‚Äôre prizes you‚Äôll never actually get enough points for. (I‚Äôm talking literal years) And their affordable prizes? Subscription box discounts, overpriced jewelry/clothes you‚Äôd never buy anyway discounts, a 3 month trial of exercise programs that give shorter trials anyway for something you won‚Äôt keep using. And even free things? Good luck because you‚Äôre paying $10-20 on shipping still.Walked almost 4000 steps and only got 10 cents for it. The only real earnings we can make is by watching the advertisements every day. If you are going to gyp us of our points that we can earn by walking, then you could at least give us better earnings by watching the advertisements every day. I know it‚Äôs not fair to give us more sweat coins for ads but it‚Äôs also not fair that you guys don‚Äôt count thousands of our steps. It‚Äôs a system to get you guys paid by us watching ads and us never being able to reach our goals on this app. I wish less greedy people had thought about this app before these creators did.I‚Äôve had problems with getting my points despite it literally showing I walked more than the 2200 steps within the 20 minutes. But that is whatever, I was just gonna let this app collect whatever it wants throughout the day and every once in awhile I‚Äôd check in. The problem with that is the ‚Äúchecking steps‚Äù part is stuck. I‚Äôve tried restarting the app, my phone and even deleting the app and reinstalling. It is stuck again in the ‚Äúchecking steps‚Äù the app has rendered itself useless. It‚Äôs becoming a nuisance. Not worth having on my phone at this point.1. Drains Battery,because it always has to be running

2. Takes forever to accumulate points unless you make a it a part time job trying to refer people to sign up.

3.The offers are üëéüèø when it comes to what the offer is and the price of sweatcoins it cost.
 
4. The offers are misleading a lot of them are just getting you a percentage off of an item which is a part of  a third party subscription site. Example: it can take you months to get 100 sweat coins then you want to use it on a fragrance offer. Then it turns out the fragrance offer is scent bird ‚Äúfree 1st month‚Äù so now you have to subscribe (put a credit card down), pay shipping and handling still and remember to cancel. Who wants to create another bill? Especially when subscriptions like that already do their own pricing ‚Äúspecials‚Äù for new subscriptions.

5. It‚Äôs a big brother sort of deal always tracking where you go. Don‚Äôt waste your battery life and most importantly your TIME!I‚Äôve been using Sweatcoin since 2019 and haven‚Äôt had any problems until recently. In the last 30 days my steps have stopped converting, sometimes for days at a time. The help section in the app is a complete joke. When attempting to troubleshoot, Sweatcoin tells you to not reach out as they cannot help with any conversion issues. What kind of customer service is this?!  Sweatcoin is collecting billions of data points on everyone of its users then  selling everything to companies, yet they refuse to troubleshoot a conversion issue???  Perhaps a name change to Scamcoin is due.The app is fun to use, easy to rack up points. When you go to cash out the points tho, buyer beware. You usually have to pay shipping which doesn‚Äôt bother me, but lately the products haven‚Äôt been showing up. You never get tracking numbers, orders still not delivered after a month plus get blamed on USPS error, ‚Äúcheck with your post office.‚Äù I get that this isn‚Äôt directly related to SWEATCOIN but you‚Äôd think they would do better to make sure they‚Äôre partnering with quality brands. After walking this road 3 times, it got deleted. I gave it the old college try, but I‚Äôm out.They want you to keep their app on in the background which drains your battery. Then make you connect your steps to your ihealth and they determine if you cheated or not. I noticed I‚Äôd get 10% of my points because apparently somehow they believe I cheated. To add to that if I were to try and collect for the $1000 prize it would take 9 years!!! I calculated that I get about $42 a week times that by 52 weeks in a year comes out to $2,184. Now they require $20,000!! For me that 9 years for those who desk work that‚Äôs even longer!  Don‚Äôt waste your time! They get good money for advertising. You can get the same Free deals online.The App offers points that can be used to buy products, but to buy the products, you have to pay shipping. No problem, except, sometimes the products don‚Äôt arrive, and there is no way to rectify this: No customer service, not order tracking, no direct way to contact vendor to inquire on order. I‚Äôve lost over $20 on an item that would have cost me, maybe $60, had I bought it in the store, but instead, I received nothing but egg on my face for sending money over an App with no customer support.I have downloaded and deleted this app multiple times over the years, hoping you would have fixed the issues each time.
But you have not.
You got indoor step counter? Yet it will not activate on my phone. If I use the outdoor step counter, I get cheated out of points.
I keep trying to give you chances, but it seems you look for more ways to cheat people rather than actually improving your app and overall quality.
Then you ask for it to be updated. When it is, you have no actual answers to the issues we are experiencing. I did everything needed. Your app is the problem and you really need to work harder into fixing it.

Edit: your response doesn't even touch what I addressed. My phone is an XR it's well past a 7. Therefore, I say again. Your developers really need to get their coding together. You should really develop a better system and algorithm.",4,buffaloh20brimuccimissjackie916comutR123hate new update!!!!!!MlgTeamleaderdianamarie53The_CornTaddgKitsunefoxkidJust Another User 21DadsBud11jeshilawazx0ur daddy:)M04910jfgr9 appimportantnewzkaela6352kel9177lilc1919ZekinthainheraspectcfddtgchuubPlagueArchitectNJHawkinsBrand CALeeRaydanderooniKolay28Nicholas Beceavikingking1109,"Absolute trashWish I actually could get somethingA huge waste of time!!!Used This App For Four Years, And It's Not Worth ItAPP CHEATS YOU!!

I walk over 10,000 daily, unless I feel bad, Im lucky for it to give me 3,000 for that day and I pay more for double coins.  Last week I walked almost 14,000 steps, but I only got 2,000 something on the app that day.  Ive emailed several times and Im told they‚Äôre aware of the glitch and apologize, but do not offer to add those missed steps to my account.

Edit since comment from Sweatcoin
I‚Äôve actually already done everything you stated, I did go to Faq on Sweatcoins first, which states exactly what you just said.  I sent an email stating I did all of this, my reply was telling me to do all of that, my reply was I already did, the next reply was exactly telling me to do the same thing again, now Im told a 4th time.  That did not work the first, second, or third time.  My apps automatically update, I double check and the app is current.  I plan on requesting a refund on what I paid and cancel my subscription, Im not paying $9.99 a month and not even get to reap the benefits when it doesn‚Äôt actually show Im walking over 10,000 steps a day.  I have already stopped promoting the app and Im no longer going out of my way to try and earn, knowing Im not going to get the points anywayI have been using this app for about two years now and was consistently getting around 20k+ steps a day which usually maxed out my 15SC/day subscription (which costs 20SC/month). It‚Äôs been an amazing app and was perfect for me since my job involves a lot of outdoor walking. Ever since the new indoor step counting update my points have NOT been auto converting like they have been so I‚Äôve been manually converting them each night before bed (if I forget to manually convert I now end up with 0SC for the day converted with around 20k steps logged) and have watched my SC dwindle down to almost nothing per day. I am writing this review now because after converting my steps for the day (19,725) the app says that only 278 of those were approved. Those 278 steps converted to 0.26SC... I have done what the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù page has said and tried closing the app, deleting and reinstalling multiple times and have not seen any improvement. I would like to keep using this app but cannot see myself continue to manually convert my steps every night just to see less that 1SC.‚ÄúOut of stock‚Äù is the name of this game for a long time..
I thought if I get premium account I would have a chance to catch the good prizes or ‚Äúoffer if the day‚Äù, but no, during the first 7 days if free trial - everything is out of stock constantly. They don‚Äôt send alerts to try to catch it so maybe it‚Äôs available for a split second and maybe not but it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous..
I used to like it and got some cool prizes - for example - a cell phone case - still using it - it‚Äôs literally the best. But it used to be like that, and not any more. Again, the points can be converted into good prizes that are always ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù

I canceled the subscription for the premium and won‚Äôt be using it any more ‚Ä¶at least till the situation changes. I hope the team reads the reviews because I can see a lot of reviews similar to mine in what the complaint is.Joined back in 2019 when there were atleast a few rewards that were worth having the app like gift cards, 'free' products(only had to pay shipping) but I recently downloaded it again since I kept getting ads for it and figured maybe theres MORE unfortunately now it seems its mainly coupons for x amounts off for random brands, No ways of cashing out for any actual cash amounts or even gift cards. At least with other sites and apps they give you actual options without just throwing your hard earned points/bucks/coins away with stupid auctions that youll never be able to get unless you've fully stacked for years. I suppose its worth it if you walk a lot and just wanna do something on the side but if youre looking for a place with genuine rewards to work towards, this likely isnt it. Kinda sad after all these years they never got much better.I have been saving my sweat coins for years now and I was really exited to spend them on 2nd generation AirPods, they were claiming to be in stock but as I tried to use my points to buy them It then said out of stock. The same happened for a Adidas gift card just yesterday. It just got me really exited, to then be bummed out. I don't know if this just happened to me or other people but I do know it's really annoying. I have tried updating the app and everything. I would enjoy if what they said was true and would not lie. So that is why I have given it a 2 stars, besides trying to spend the coins the Apple Watch app is really nice and lets me calculate my steps on the go. So not all complaints hahah. Trying to buy other stuff has been a hassle as well.
I just hope this can be revised and maybe some how i can spend my points on those AirPods.  üòÅ
-EthanThe app seems great to get out there and healthy with of course some incentive. With all of that the main issue is it not counting steps, and I must open and reopen the app to make it work?! Like what is the point of this being a background app if I have to open it to make sure it got my steps. Even if it does read your steps you might as well leave it off because it only counts 1/3 of them. The app tracked 10k worth of steps but only gave credit for 3 sweat coins. Like what? I thought getting the 15 points a day would be easy but I am sadly mistaken. It costs more to do the monthly shaker then to accrue points. Also the prizes are a lot of junk and some of them will take years to earn if you walk the max everyday. I have had the app for about a year now and have a few points but nothing near what I need for something worth while. Now that it won‚Äôt even track the steps I do take I am uninstalling.The ads for this app say that you can earn free things like shoes and stuff with your steps. For starters I have never seen the ability to redeem a gift card for shoes or anything similar. Typically it‚Äôs like 20-50% off some obscure brand you‚Äôve never heard of or the first month free of a paid subscription (that you totally can‚Äôt get anyway if you go to their website) The app also gives you the chance to earn sweat coins by watching adds which if you are an average person who doesn‚Äôt get to walk outside very much that will be your primary income. I‚Äôve had this app for over a year and I‚Äôm barely past 1K sweat coins and I can‚Äôt redeem anything of real value to me. i just want the adds to represent the app and to get better rewards that don‚Äôt cost 20K sweat coins or 500 and it‚Äôs almost worthless. I just want something attainable. $1000 gift cards for 20K points are insane! Why not $50 gift cards for 1K or $100 for 2K?the concept behind this app is really cool and pretty well thought out, but its almost impossible to actually earn anything. there's a cap on how many points you can earn daily (5 on a free membership). i did the math: even if you were to meet the point cap every day, it would take almost ELEVEN YEARS to earn the $1,000 reward (which costs 20,000 points). there is no lower reward that you can earn on your own (you can earn $10-$20 through inviting people). obviously, more can be earned through paid memberships or the 30-day free trial for each tier, but after the free trial, you're on your own to earn the currency (at the extremely low cap of 5 sweatcoins, which is worth 25 cents in US currency). these calculations don't include the daily login rewards (which are 1, 2, and 4 swc a day on rotation), but even if it did it would make very little difference.
it's not worth your time.For example, today my Apple Activity app logged 15,197 steps. Both my Sweatcoin and Million Steps apps logged 11,772. Not too bad, right? Well, while Million Steps credited me for 11,772 steps, Sweatcoin only credited 2,502 steps. This app is intentionally cheating me by approving a fraction of what it actually recognizes as steps. It seems the more options allotted for bonus points the less steps are approved. Similarly, the more steps walked, the less steps are approved. What a rip off!

In response to the developer, my app is up to date and background app refresh doesn‚Äôt even give me the option to turn it off and back on. It‚Äôs always on and without the capability to turn it off. The app recognizes the steps I take. It just doesn‚Äôt credit Sweatcoins for those steps. My phone is not the issue. It seems the app is designed to not give out more than a certain amount of Sweatcoins per person per day.the app kills a lot of battery to keep it on in the background all the time to count the steps (when it even counts them, that is). furthermore to count more than x amount of steps you have to pay to upgrade. and the prizes? you can‚Äôt combine points (say, with your significant other) to redeem the prize. all the steps have to be earned by you.  if you didn‚Äôt pay to upgrade, it would take FOREVER maybe over a decade to even earn enough for one of the larger prizes. the smaller ones aren‚Äôt really a deal at all.. you spend more on shipping and makes me feel like it‚Äôs a double win for the business instead of the consumer. Doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to pay to upgrade multiple levels and kill my battery.I have the premium subscription, I only pay 25$ per year but there‚Äôs really no point in having this anymore. 
When I joined in 2019 there were ways to win trips to Disney. Now you need like 25k points just to win a bidding war for a 300$ gift card. 
There are also things on here as ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù that are already available. For example when you download Robinhood and join you get a free stock if you go through the app, but this is already available anyhow.
I‚Äôve had it for over 3 years and only have 5k sweat coin. Get it if you‚Äôd like, I just have it sitting in the background watching my steps but unless you‚Äôre always running around it doesn‚Äôt really do much.This is a battery drainer. I can only get 5 credits per day without spending money on the app. It also sends a lot of annoying emails. For someone giving access to information on their phone, sweatcoin isn‚Äôt compensating or rewarding for this information. I walk over 20k steps outside each day, I should be getting all kinds of points. I feel sweatcoin is getting access to my phone and not rewarding fairly for this information. How long will it take to buy anything when you top out at 5 coins a day? Not looking very promising sweatcoin team. I feel I have been scammed.I hate to say this, but I loved the app, and as a college student i walk around 10-20k steps everyday to go to my classes. It felt empowering knowing that each of your steps was literally bringing you closer to a reward. However, ever since the update where you can count indoor steps, NONE of my steps have been approved, so ive lost so many what would have been points. Ive tried to contact help twice with no avail, and Ive just been losing points to my ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù. Its frustrating and I feel like writing this review is the only way they might listen.Great idea, and slick app. But, the extremely low value of a SweatCoin relative to the items in the marketplace makes nearly all interesting items too expensive to be realistically achievable. For example, it would cost 20k points for an iPhone, but a person can only earn a maximum of 600 points per month (that is, if they log 20,000 steps every day). So, the fastest possible time you could ‚Äúearn‚Äù an iPhone would be 33+ months (again, having logged 20,000 steps a day that whole time).

So, until the prices/coin value change dramatically, it just isn‚Äôt worth installing.The app is really good but you take all steps and you get points from it and you could only buy things for half off or like 20% off or something but the only things that are good on their like the gift cards are only for premium users, which makes you pay month every single month I give it to stars it could be better maybe if they put more better stuff on there for you to actually buy with your points it would be five stars for me.When I first got this app about 4 years ago I really enjoyed it. There were attainable goals and products you could purchase. I even got enough points for a free pair of sunglasses that I love to this day. Anymore, the physical products are always ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and the digital offers aren‚Äôt even worth spending credits on, because you can find the same offers online with the Honey app for free. There is no point to this app. Unless you are using it as an unreliable steps counter.",1,alhoover81Djsuperman654321BellaSasha123456789beccam97Ethan :) ‚ú®Aura Reloaded...Buler...SadMe12322aj22Pr1ncess17w.t.f._xdpaulypaul007Anonymous who has this appMrJayhawkniCKname638394646Mrk 96,IffyLatest ‚ÄúIndoor‚Äù Step Counting Update Ruined My Experience.2 stars in a good memory if what it used to be2019Misleading and disappointingOkey app at bestThe Ads lienot worth the hype or the timeCheating Algorithmdoesn‚Äôt seem worth itNo longer worth itGiving it a few weeksSteps stopped converting since the updateNot worth itWhat I think could be betterUsed to be great but has really gone down hill.,Sweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2398,has_points,80

This is not built for you. Do you walk relatively fast? This is not built for you. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and I am by no means a fast walker‚Äîthis app only counts every 3rd step of mine. I can‚Äôt imagine how frustrating this might be for someone faster than me or someone with long strides (which might confuse the conversion ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù). 
It also only transfers steps on wifi and loses some of the progress you made when you weren‚Äôt on wifi. Which totally defeats the purpose of walking outside. And since walking at the gym is too fast, you‚Äôre screwed either way.
Now I‚Äôm aware the company is gonna respond to this with some BS about how they‚Äôre going to fix it after my review but I‚Äôve had this app for awhile (half a year) and back then they said the same thing to other people. I‚Äôm going to keep it around to get what points I can but everyone else who gets this app needs to be aware of its many many limitations.I love this app! I'm always going somewhere and doing things and I love watching the coins rack up. However, I would really like it if you could make it count my steps inside. I work as a waitress in a restaurant and I walk A LOT. I work from 5-10 most days and maybe after 2 hours my fitbit tells me that I have reaches my 10,000 step goal for the day. It's just kind of disapoints me that I can't get any credit for those on this app! If you guys could make it work for inside as well as outside, I'd probably would have given it a 5 star review and mentioned it to my friends, but none of my friends really have time to walk outside all the time either so they wouldn't download the app. :(
Other than the no inside steps thing, I think that this app is great, and maybe put a little bit more of a varity of prizes?ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI have been with this app for over two years now and I do pay for a small membership. Overall I would give this about a 7 out of 10 stars. What I hate is that it tricks you into watching way more ads than what is required. out of my steps for the bonuses. Unfortunately I feel like I have come too far to turn back and delete the app because I have built up a lot of points over two years. But the shenanigans are starting to really tick me off! If you want us to watch six ads then just say it, don‚Äôt trick people into watching up to 6 ads for bonus points. I have written several times with no response. It‚Äôs really not that hard to be fair with people!I‚Äôve been using this app for well over a year. No complaints until recently. They started bonus points, which was a nice touch during the pandemic, but more nothing works right anymore. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reinstalled multiple times but the same problem occurs. The daily boost starts but never finishes analyzing results so I don‚Äôt get daily step coins or bonus coins. The daily bonus videos have slightly increased in size so when the video finishes the x I‚Äôd over the power bar on my iPhone. I can‚Äôt close the video so no daily bonuses either. Reloading tonight for one more try. Wish there was a way to contact them for technical help other than the delete and reinstall option.I was really happy when my sister told me about an app that rewards walking. So immediately as New Years resolution I installed it and made sure to walk at least 5000 steps. Then realized I can actually walk more than 7000 on a regular day just from home to work (taking public transport). Today, after seen as swollen my knees were from all the stairs I walked outsiders I thought ‚Äúoh but it was worth it for my points‚Äù so I checked my app and boom 7407 step and ONLY a bit over 3000 steps counted. 
Sorry but my free data must be rewarded with the exact steps I take. No more data from this walker.This app is ok when it comes down to walking to earn money, but I would put this app into a pay to win category because the only way you will be able to get those big prizes is by paying for a better membership. When you take time to find out how long it would take it would take around 6 months of pure walking just to get an IPhone which is understandable for the price but by the time they reach that amount of points the new phone will already be out. So in conclusion it was a relatively a good idea for this app but there‚Äôs to much problems that people don‚Äôt see.The shop to spend points is pretty underwhelming already but when it asks you how you feel about the shop it does not let you write feedback. It only lets you hit the green smiley face which is pretty weird because when you want to give negative feedback it tells you that your connection is poor and you cannot do anything but it goes through immediately when you hit the green :)

I just thought that was interesting how it has always done this but the shop is still pretty lame.I have used this app for 5 years. 

Used to really enjoy this app running peacefully in the background and counting my steps. 

I accumulated a lot of points and I still have them. 

But they are linked to my email address that I can‚Äôt use to login because it‚Äôs by phone number only. 
So I login with my new number and somehow got a new account. 
Googled it, then learned I needed to take my old number and update it to this phone 
(It‚Äôs registers one phone at a time)

Changed my old number to my new number and got some girl‚Äôs account named Tawtianna
And I can‚Äôt log out neither 
I have to completely delete the app and start again. 

Now two people are out of their accounts. 

I‚Äôm gonna attempt to call support and then I‚Äôll update this review. Although, this shouldn‚Äôt have been a problem in the first place. 

I suggest allowing email login.I been having this app for a while and I walk a lot because of work but there‚Äôs something wrong with this app I have walk a lot this Monday- Wednesday and this Thursday I wasn‚Äôt walking a lot because I really didn‚Äôt wanted to get tired that day and I got the same steps as the rest of the other days and I know for sure there‚Äôs something wrong or they don‚Äôt want you to get a lot of points and I pay 1$ subscription I don‚Äôt recommend you to get the subscription I hope this help for the rest of you guys but they should fix thisI‚Äôve been using this app a little over a year and I‚Äôve honestly never seen anything worth obtaining. And then I‚Äôve collected over 350 in money for my steps but only spend maybe 30 bucks from my account and I‚Äôm all the way down to 165. This is because of the outrageous amount for monthly subscribers. If you ask me it‚Äôs a waste of time thinking you‚Äôre getting your steps counted for points to only loose them to use the app. And then the offers are just pointless.If you‚Äôre impatient like me: I have had this app for a while and It is not the most rewarding unless you buy or sign up for something it will take me like 10 years to actually get something.
Are patient: this app is good for you it is rewarding but it takes a while to get points.
Big spender: you can get bonus points for buying something.

Overall this app still is free money just depends on how much spend and walk!Really loved this app but recent updates seemed to have stopped working for older devices. I amassed a pretty hearty loot of steps and points but for the past 5 months, no matter how many steps I ring up, it does not generate points on my iPhone 6s.  These steps were outside only. We‚Äôre talking 7000 steps a day not being tracked. Growing frustrated I just donated all of my points to charity and will probably be deleting the app until I can buy a newer phone.The app is really easy to use in all you get 1 cent every step you do but the thing I hate about this app is that you have to be super early at the shop to e redeem the points because every time you check the shop they are out of stock already. This is super annoying I bet  people stay up late to buy from the store when they are fully in stock",1,Katenaxsamanthamholl67realty goddessLunsford gangSumairyTrex gonna eat ujamesE.BasicBrittani on YTGeorgy_10duh-duh45üòûüò±üò∞üò≠gstsdwJacobv1897,"Keep Your Expectations LOWInside Steps PleaseTired of the tricksNeeds improvementI rate you with Half the start as u count only half my stepsGreat appInteresting bugYo, Can I have my account back?This app it‚Äôs alrightNeeds more offer optionsDepends on your personalityOlder devices beware.Easy to earn points but hard to earn the prizes",Sweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,13,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1545,has_points,80

I have always walked but in Feb 2019 I decided to pay more attention to the amount of walking I do.  In June I stumbled on your app while playing Wordscapes.  The first few times the info popped up I simply ignored it. Then one day I took a look and figured what can it hurt.  I am very happy that out here in the mountains you are able to pick up the GPS signal.  Typically, I walk close to 20,000 steps daily.  There have been a few times when the count picked up by the app has been off - but overall I think it does a pretty good job. 

I don‚Äôt really care about the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù or ‚Äúoffers‚Äù because it seems to be a way to sucker you into subscriptions that just cost you money in the end.  I did purchase the $$ from PayPal but was disappointed about the way the offer is presented. It sounds as if all you need do is have people sign up and use the app but then you are told you have to give up 30 SWCs to get the PayPal $6.  That seemed a bit lopsided to me. 

The chance to help out with various causes appeals to me but I have not figured out what needs to be done to participate in these.  If I‚Äôm going to lose SWCs I‚Äôd rather lose them for a good cause. 

For now I just keep racking up daily points It‚Äôs a daily boost to my spirit when I get the feedback that I have met my daily goal. I figure I‚Äôll go up another level once I have hit the current mark for 30 straight days.I‚Äôve been using this awesome app for a few years! However, I just got an Apple Watch and it needs work. I‚Äôm used to getting a few hundred steps to not match my activity but now it‚Äôs cutting off thousands. Initially I figured it needed time to catch up but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the issue. The app on the watch seems to be what‚Äôs lagging not the phone app. Now that I‚Äôm paying for the app instead of using the free version I would appreciate getting my steps.

Update: Deleted the app off my watch because it was cutting way more than the app on the phone itself. Why not match the steps from the health app? I walked around the park twice, outside, and roughly had 13,288 steps but only 8,840 were approved even though I had the app open and my phone on to see if it would be more accurate. Clearly it wasn‚Äôt, as a trouble maker that‚Äôs a loss of almost 8 points (1,000 steps=1SWC+1SWC Bonus). It‚Äôs hard to set a goal if the app isn‚Äôt working.I have a lot of fun with the app, and have developed some level of obsession. I only write reviews when I feel very very strongly about it, and being a professional content/app tester at a software company, I have had my own share of frustrations with the UI, and annoying bugs I‚Äôve seen with Sweatcoin over the years.

1. Please implement an ‚Äúabort‚Äù option for the 2X Boost, because sometimes it just gets stuck on ‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Äù forever. The problem is, when I start the boost at the beginning of my walk, it doesn‚Äôt update the rest of the steps due to this bug, and gives me 0 step. Very fristrating.

2. Please do a good job of reviewing your make partners‚Äô (sponsors) ads. Make sure they are able to submit their advertisements ONLY if they don‚Äôt try to do something shady, like making the ‚ÄúX‚Äù (close) button so crappy that I have to press an exact point within that ‚ÄúX‚Äù or else I‚Äôll get taken to the app store like 5 times before being able to actually close the app.

3. Please make sure that your ads don‚Äôt get stuck while loading. This happens at least 2-3 times a week and it‚Äôs very frustrating. After waiting for a while, I force close the app and restart and usually it will work fine, but sometimes it takes numerous tries.

Again, I enjoy the app but these points have made me delete the app a couple times. For better engagement please address these issues.When my friend mention this I laugh no kidding. Then I saw some interesting things you can redeem with your steps you do per day. The free ver is only 5 dolors limit or 5000 steps Limit the others are 5 dollars more but it‚Äôs a month free trial which not bad since I walk like 10 thousand steps just now. And downloaded this app literally last night and morning I went outside. Batter saver good however there an issue on not counting the total steps. It drains a lot battery I will say from 70 percent from 35 percent for 8 hours outside. I work outdoors so I walk a lot. This app really makes you want walk more. I mean who wouldn‚Äôt want earn free money for walking. This pretty cool also I still haven‚Äôt redeem anything since a lot offers require a lot points or money so I‚Äôll be saving them till I find a good offer or just save them for year see how much I make.I have sweatcoin 4/5 because even though I really love what they are doing, it isn‚Äôt as rewarding as it could be. It takes a really long time to get enough points (in my opinion) for anything worthwhile. The only prizes I like need at least 750 Sc and that would take probably at least 9 months. It would be amazing to get the $1000 pay pal prize but you need 20 THOUSAND POINTS! It would take about over three years just to get those points. Who knows if that prize is even there by then?
However this app is great for making what is normally a boring activity- walking outside- meaningful and rewarding. I am way more motivated to walk outside because of this app and that is awesome. And I have gotten a few cool small prizes. I just wish the selection was more diverse and large for prizes. Thanks sweat coin!I‚Äôve had sweatcoin for a little over a year now and it‚Äôs honestly really good, however there is one problem. The market place is always sold out on actual products. I looked it up and there‚Äôs rumors of it being because of people using bots to auto buy when the store refreshes. Pretty easy fix though, if you just add some human verification it would fix the bot issue. However I can‚Äôt doc too many points because so many people use the app that it‚Äôs also kind of a no brained as to why things sell out so fast.I really love sweatcoin! It‚Äôs a great concept, easy to use, works great and had a good variety of prizes to choose from... except cashing out from PayPal! I tend to not use this app because of this. You can get payed through PayPal from inviting friends, but you can turn your points into money! The prizes are nice, but none of them really interest me, and I‚Äôm sure many others can agree. Please add the option to cash out your points into PayPal! I love the app, but I don‚Äôt really use it because of that. If you add it it would be the best feature! Hopefully sweatcoin sees this!People in reviews always say ‚Äúu get barely anything from walking so much‚Äù but they don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs basically free money, why would anyone complain about free money, some flaws I noticed were the lag, the amount of coins you get which is low but reasonable since u know, it‚Äôs free cash. Other Than that, the app is really just here racking up points and one day u will check it and probably be able to turn in most of those points for cash or something of valueA lot of these offers come with shipping and handling fees and trials that automatically renew if you don‚Äôt cancel. But if you already walk outside a lot (it doesn‚Äôt log inside steps well) it can be fun to see your ‚Äúmoney‚Äù pile up.

More in depth, you earn sweatcoins(points), by how many steps you take throughout the day. These points can be used to buy items on the app. The app offers more than that, sometimes I stress the fact that I can not help the world, as much as I want to. I‚Äôm not rich, so I can‚Äôt buy a house for everyone, but this app allows you to earn points, so you can help people who need help. I feel like a much greater person, I‚Äôm giving back to the world, it may not be much, but I know I‚Äôm contributing more than I would‚Äôve without the app. I want to say ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù to the creators of this app, because they are helping the world through a free app, not many people do that. What the app has become is beautiful, it‚Äôs benefiting many people in the world, and benefiting many animals, so thank you.I know it‚Äôs not a lot of points but it‚Äôs nice to gain a few every now and then because soon it would gather up and worth a lot. Although the points does not award you for every single steps, the main goal is more important which is to go out and walk around. My main issue is the rewards. I would like if they added gift cards because I saw one app similar to this that had gift cards but they used too much data unlike sweatcoin so I deleted it. 

I think it would bring more users if there was a gift card options but the rewards sections they have now is still good (it always introduces new companies to me like for example a tea company called Harney and Sons).I love sweat coin because it motivates me to walk more even though the gifts are not that great.   I get points while I  exercise and make money.  I noticed when you close the app down and reopen it you must hit the ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù button or the app doesn‚Äôt count your steps,  so try this and see if it works because I too have noticed the app not counting all my steps, but it only happens when I fail to hit the response key when it tells you that sweat coin has been shut down.  Just remember to hit that little response key that says ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù.I honestly want to recommend & let everybody I know about this super awesome app!! Plus, whoever clicks on the link I either sent them or posted to my social media, I get super easy üíµ (cash) back for whoever clicks on the link! üò≤ I LOVE how easy & simple it is to convert my steps into such easy ca$h, SO quickly!! Unlike all the other apps like this that take wayyyy too long trying to stack up points to make a dollar. This one literally is the best & easiest one out there!The app itself is a great idea and the developers really made it amazing. You walk to earn points that allow you to earn quality products. This app isn‚Äôt a scam and you really receive the items you purchase with your points. The only catch is that it takes a while to earn the points, so you have to walk a lot to earn good things. Other than that this app is great and I love using it.I have to say since I by accident stumbled upon this app I didn‚Äôt think it was real until I started researching a little bit about it and now I‚Äôm so happy I did!!! thank you I don‚Äôt know how you guys do it but don‚Äôt stop!!! It actually motivates me to actually get up a little earlier to get some extra points before work in the mornings!! Thank you!!Nice app!! I like that it tracks automatically, no need to spend time on that. Obviously the points build up slowly, would take forever to get the big purchases. But whats exciting that you can get some stuff for cheap really! Just got a box of doggy treats for just couple days of my regular walking!
BUT a bigger variety of available purchases would be great.Only had this app for about 5 days but so far I‚Äôve earned 20 of the spending points. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but you can really only early 5 a day. Just have it run in the background. I work in a kitchen so this counts my steps and I earn while I earn a living. It does count your steps while inside even though it says it doesn‚Äôt. No issues here.

First off the step counter is WAY off, all the time. I noticed from the beginning I was getting cheated out of at least 1000 steps a day, usually more. When you finally have generated enough steps to buy something your options are seriously limited. Most of them fall into health and fitness categories, which I don‚Äôt mind it would just be nice to have a bit more variety. Then after you get past the physical items they have a variety of coupons to offer in exchange for sweat coins. Please don‚Äôt buy coupons on this app, I promise you can get almost all of them from a different source without having to pay anything for them. A quick Google search will find the same coupon. I did that frequently and saved my sweat coins. I only was able to buy on thing with my sweat coins that I was interested in. In the end I ended up paying about $20 in shipping for the item. It was a bag of coffee and I was really hesitant to pay, but since I had already used my sweat coins I didn‚Äôt want to waste them. The app would also continuously crash on me as well. Ultimately I donated the rest of my sweat coins to charity, which I am willing to bet much of the money did not actually go to said charity. I have since deleted this app and I don‚Äôt see myself getting it again. If another app pops up following the same idea in a more honest way, I‚Äôll probably give it a try.I have never taken time to review any app but I felt very compelled to as I just tried to send feedback through from a prompted ‚Äúdo you love out app??‚Äù and after several attempts of hitting the frowned face and explanation with it saying ‚Äúcould not send feedback‚Äù as an error code‚Ä¶guess what?? It went through fine when I changed it to a smiley face‚Ä¶.hmmm. So basically I signed up for it a few years ago seeing if I could get something back for the steps I was doing. At the time they would occasionally post some Apple products (from big big points accumulating, but fair enough) along with some little $5 things and some 50% off things. I don‚Äôt mind being marketed to in a free app as long as they‚Äôre providing value to me. Maybe the paid version has more, but I‚Äôm not here to buy things I‚Äôm here to trade an activity for goods at the cost of being marketed to. Now it‚Äôs nothing but free trials and coupons after years of steps. Don‚Äôt waste your time, they don‚Äôt want to use those dollars the marketers are paying them to make it a remotely valuable experience for users. I don‚Äôt even trust they‚Äôre properly donating from the ‚Äúdonation‚Äù section of purchases. The fake feedback was what disgusted me enough to make a public review- if you‚Äôve built an app that so bad you won‚Äôt even take feedback within the app, I guess I‚Äôll just have to post publicly.This app is a SCAM!!! You think you‚Äôre earning free money just by walking around outside, but here‚Äôs the catch; the items you can purchase with your Sweatcoins still demand some of your own money for shipping, membership, etc. and you end up getting sucked into something you thought was a good deal, but I‚Äôve checked multiple times and they probably save you only $2 at most.
I‚Äôve read soooo many reviews saying that Sweatcoin ripped them off after they had already spent their unfairly earned coins for ‚Äúprizes‚Äù and when they tried to fix the problem with Customer Service, they never picked up, never returned phone calls, kept getting transferred to person after person, you name it. (I don‚Äôt say unfairly earned lightly, you could participate in 5 marathons in a day and they would only give you about $2 worth of coins) Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt experience this first hand because I was saving my coins for the ultimate price; $1,000. And I‚Äôm so glad I deleted the app before I invested too much time into it, because I would have been furious!!
ALSO, they track your location 24/7 to continuously count the steps you take every hour of every day, but honestly that is just straight up sketchy....Not worth it. ANDDDD they force you to keep the app running so it can be on in the background, lurking, tracking, and watching your every move. How creepy is that???Sweat coin will intice you with a crazy idea of turning daily steps into money they get sponsors to give all the real little products and offers and they gain from that too but when it comes to your actuall collection of sweat coins it‚Äôs only worth using after years of continuously getting steps too get your worth from the app but before you get anywhere near a high number of coins where you can actually get your times worth they will purposely make people accounts defective it will stop receiving steps even with everything done well and if you try to do anything about it they purposely have a horrible customer service so it becomes a continuous gain no loss cycle for them they got a crypto coin before even having a single person you can talk to as customer service they will do anything to make you stop using the app when you are getting higher and higher amounts of coins and all the winners and buyers for the big stuff probably fake too because even every time I‚Äôve ever tried to get one of the cheaper items from the shop you can‚Äôt ever actually get them it just throws you of course there app is not too good to be true it‚Äôs just if it was true everyone would of been fit already - 4-5 years saving trying and walking for nothing thank you SweatcoinI understand that this a small team (this fact was mentioned in the help section of the app). But I've contacted the developer three times now about a very serious issue and to date, no one has responded back. Not even an auto-generated email saying 'hey, your feedback has been received, your ticket is in a que'. I'm literally logged into SOMEONE ELSE'S ACCOUNT. The only way this could have happened is that my phone number (which I haven't had for very long) was attached to someone else's account before. Since we don't create login credentials during setup, there's no way for me to sign out of this individual's account and for me to sign into my own. This is a MAJOR security issue. Absolutely nothing in the forums or the help section is going to help me resolve this issue; I need to talk to an actual person. If you have time to make an app and update it (shows last update 4 days ago), you've got to make time for your customers too. Use a CRM platform with a ticketing system, there's plenty to choose from. And one more thing... this is a big one and I probably won't use this app until they change this... allow users to create login credentials during setup so something like what I'm experiencing doesn't happen to someone else. People's phone numbers change sometimes.This app has potential. But it misses A LOT of steps. My iPhone will register 20k steps and this app might register 1k. Sometimes it will skip entire days. I‚Äôm a collegiate athlete that plays soccer, which means I‚Äôm racking up a lot of steps! I train 6 days a week for at least 2 hours. Anyone that knows anything about the sport, you know there‚Äôs a lot of running back and forth continuously. On some of my training days, this app will register about 600 steps. That‚Äôs including my whole day, nevertheless the steps I put on the field. üôÑ 
I contacted the developers and at first received responses, and they claimed it was perhaps my GPS that was malfunctioning (which it‚Äôs not the issue; my GPS would not skip entire days!) But now when I send a question to support, I dont receive support; just an email asking how I would rate my support.
So my opinion? I‚Äôll maybe still use this app, but it‚Äôs not worth any stars. If it at least caught the right amount of steps, regardless of the payout, it would be worth more.There are so many issues with the app that I don‚Äôt know where to begin. First of all your indoor steps aren‚Äôt counted which is complete bull. Some of your outside steps aren‚Äôt counted. The offers are all trash, being either they‚Äôre way to expensive, or you have to pay extra, or it‚Äôs a stupid product altogether. There‚Äôs no in app support system where users can easily give feedback and that‚Äôs a big problem with an app with this many issues. To call it a crypto currency is just fraud because you can‚Äôt convert any of it to dollars or spend it anywhere else than the in app shop. I‚Äôm keeping the app just for the sake of the possibilities, but if the app developers really want to improve it and make it the next big thing, it needs some major improvements and better offers. Some people don‚Äôt have 20$ to spend on a product you‚Äôre already laying sweatcoins for.Like many of the real reviews on here, I have had the app for a few years. I have earned over 6000 sweat coins. The products are ALWAYS sold out. Also looking at the reviews the company is obviously having many fake posts about the software or business software being so great. Not giving any actual valuable feedback to people who may sign up for this service and pay for the better memberships. Assuming they don‚Äôt make enough steps to pay for the membership I believe this is coming out of their own pockets correct? Fake reviews to boost your appearance in the App Store is against the law. The FTC can fine you up to 14,000$ per post for engaging in this deceptive practice. Maybe just work to improve the app instead of inflating your stars on the App Store.I‚Äôve had this app for yrs now. I‚Äôve downloaded and deleted the app over the years I‚Äôve had it. Yes it does track you step but not each one which is perfectly fine with me. I‚Äôve collected over 1500 steps. One day I decided to purchase a watch with the sweat coin money. And the only thing I had to do was pay for shipping. Which was around $5-$10 dollars. I made the purchase back in May of this year. It is now July and I still haven‚Äôt gotten my watch. I have sent emails regarding the situation and have gotten no feedback whatsoever. The tracking is over a month old with no updates. It does not show where your package is located at all. It‚Äôs very frustrating because I still had to use my own money to purchase items which I never received!!!I‚Äôve had this for 3 years now. They originally had some ok rewards that you had to save for. They‚Äôve gotten rid of those completely. I do not want just a %off of some subscription site. There are almost NO physical products and no gift cards. Then you get sound standard response from them saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt seen anything you liked yet but our rewards are new everyday‚Äù no. They‚Äôre not. They're trash. In the app it asked for feedback but only if you like it. If you hit the sad face and try to give feedback it says ‚Äúcheck your Internet connection‚Äù I‚Äôm done ‚Äúwaiting and hoping‚Äù for better things. There are plenty of other apps I actually earn things from. Do better.Littered with ads, some of which you opt in without wanting to (reward collection). The user interface is as amateur as the video presenting the concept. The concept is very unrewarding for the first few days where you achieve nothing despite walking 10 miles. 50 push notifications all the freaking time of day and night. Wants access to location all the time and not just while using the app so it ruins your battery in half a day. No thank you.

Edit based on passive aggressive smiley faced dev feedback: absolutely not true. Sponsored content peppered everywhere. Also 10 push notifications and 3 emails in 48 hours is needy as like a bad needy girlfriend come to life in the shape of a poorly designed app.The Feedback UI is garbage: You can‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre typing, uploading images doesn‚Äôt work, pressing send doesn‚Äôt visually indicate completion, and best of all, ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô just emails you a template email containing the information in the FAQ. I haven‚Äôt been able to get in contact with a person from Sweatcoin.

Aside from the UI, the selection of prizes is very small, even more so if you don‚Äôt have their monthly/yearly subscription.

One feature of the app is that your coins will be deleted if you don‚Äôt use the app within a certain time period! Meaning, if you end up deleting the app and forgetting about it, when you reinstall it again you‚Äôll have lost all of your coins.
In your quest to emulate a crypto currency (a currency whose transactions are stored in shared blockchain to prevent a central authority from holding all the power) you, the central authority holding all the power, decided to delete them after a while‚Ä¶ What a fantastic feature >:(At first I was really excited to try Sweatcoin. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to get paid for doing what most human beings do on a daily basis? However, after months of using it I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs borderline a scam. I‚Äôve checked the shop every single day the moment it‚Äôs supposed to update and it‚Äôs a literal impossibility to buy anything. So sure, you‚Äôre earning money for when you walk. However, it‚Äôs a currency that‚Äôs impossible to spend. Months ago I sent in constructive feedback before writing this 1 star review. I was really hoping they‚Äôd make it possible to acquire something from the shop.Not only does this app facilitate and encourage and help fake companies scam their consumers. They refuse to take responsibility and do anything about it. I purchased the Alfa Play headphones via this app months ago with the use of ‚Äúsweatcoins‚Äù I had earned and real money in which I was required to pay for shipping. Not only did I never receive the product, but I was charged and never could contact anyone about it. Sweat coins continuously told me to contact the manufacturer of the headphones, in which no one would contact me back and now the company no longer exist. It‚Äôs just a blatant scam.I tried to submit this through the feedback portion when asked but it doesn‚Äôt work if you click the frownie sad and write a reason. Anyways I‚Äôve had this app for years actually. I have something like 4000 sweat coins. There are no goods to be purchased with sweatcoins. I can enter giveaways with them but I‚Äôm not interested in that. it seems like this app just wants to keep collecting my information and I‚Äôm not getting anything for it. I don‚Äôt want to spend my sweatcoins to enter giveaways. Will be disconnecting from the app since I can‚Äôt spend my sweatcoins.Simple math shows your auctions are worthless. Currently I‚Äôd have to bid 17,308 coins or roughly 10 months of walking to maybe win a $75 gift card. Y‚Äôall could/should be better. Back in the day 20k coins got you $1000 from PayPal

By the way when I‚Äôve attempted to submit this via the app it always says I have internet issues and to try again later.  Funny part is if I press the dumb happy face in your app it goes through without issue. So essentially they only want positive feedback through the app.",1,hello_roccobuffaloh20MonalyssaBrookeFlaotyvangomexMadalisoWantedAutumn55KELLYCLARKSONTOPFANMs. BluBerrySmforeman613Jamel Okujoshington_1Hunter B11devintwinkletoesKimmi0109Alex_b87,Not as great as promisedAbsolute trashDON‚ÄôT waste your time with this app!!!Scammers‚ùóÔ∏èMAJOR SECURITY ISSUE‚ùóÔ∏èCould be greatSo many problemsSo many bots posting reviewsSCAM?!Crap AppSpammy messNot worth the timeExcited at first.Zero stars if possibleWaste of time.Gotta love an app that won‚Äôt take negative feedback,Sweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,1,0,16,1,2,0,0,0,2701,has_feedback,28

Saw this app got excited and downloaded. Here‚Äôs my issue. I have no idea how to use my currency. I know you are supposed to use the market place too shops but idk how to use that either because all it is is clubs and stuff. Next, I feel scammed. When i saw the tiktok ad it said nothing about you not being able too cash out. if i would have known it would have been more useful. i know that this is a motivational tool and it‚Äôs kind of impossible to give some much amounts of money to certain people but addressing this stuff is important. 

Now that i wrote my experience, here‚Äôs some things i would take into consideration.

-A tutorial. I feel this would make the app way easier to use.

- Of Course, a cash out feature

-Not making the only way to get gift cards is by having premium 

That‚Äôs all from me and don‚Äôt take this harsh because i don‚Äôt know how to make an app, but do take this as constructive feedback because it is always good for hand multiple perspectives.I tried to submit my feedback in the apl when it asked if I enjoyed the marketplace and it errored out. It acted like I wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet. But when I chose the happy face it went through. So it wouldn‚Äôt accept the negative feedback. Wouldn‚Äôt let me change it back to the sad face. Very suspect. Therefore, I will submit it here. 

Feedback:
There aren‚Äôt real products I can buy directly from Sweatcoin anymore. It‚Äôs just gift cards that give a certain percentage off. That‚Äôs not interesting to me at all. I would like it to be like it was before where I could get actual products in here with my sweat coins and not have to pay a percentage.

I was expecting (from ads on instagram by other users) that there could be a direct payout to PayPal through this app. I was disappointed when I could not find one and the only offer for a PayPal payout was after 20,000 Sweatcoins. With this math, approximately 20 sc would be 1 usd which would also add up and it would be a much better app if there could be a direct payout. Although I understand the offers that sweatcoin needs to continuously run and be paid for it, there could be other ways of doing it. Like having multiple options for payout (including direct PayPal deposit) while possibly adding ads into the app which I wouldn‚Äôt mind, though I can‚Äôt speak for the rest of the population... overall a good app just not what I was expecting.This used to be a good app when you could actually get stuff from the marketplace and they had enough stock. Now, products run out within an hour of being released, oftentimes before I even wake up in the morning. I have thousands of sweatcoins burning a hole in my pocket that I can‚Äôt use because all of your ‚Äúpay with sweatcoins‚Äù offers are sold out. And they won‚Äôt let you provide real feedback on the app, so that‚Äôs why I came here. 
I‚Äôve gotten some good things from this app like a great water bottle and some shoelaces. But all of the good ‚Äúpay with sweatcoins‚Äù products sell out so quickly now that I‚Äôm beginning to wonder why I even bother using the app anymore.The shop to spend points is pretty underwhelming already but when it asks you how you feel about the shop it does not let you write feedback. It only lets you hit the green smiley face which is pretty weird because when you want to give negative feedback it tells you that your connection is poor and you cannot do anything but it goes through immediately when you hit the green :)

I have always walked but in Feb 2019 I decided to pay more attention to the amount of walking I do.  In June I stumbled on your app while playing Wordscapes.  The first few times the info popped up I simply ignored it. Then one day I took a look and figured what can it hurt.  I am very happy that out here in the mountains you are able to pick up the GPS signal.  Typically, I walk close to 20,000 steps daily.  There have been a few times when the count picked up by the app has been off - but overall I think it does a pretty good job. 

I don‚Äôt really care about the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù or ‚Äúoffers‚Äù because it seems to be a way to sucker you into subscriptions that just cost you money in the end.  I did purchase the $$ from PayPal but was disappointed about the way the offer is presented. It sounds as if all you need do is have people sign up and use the app but then you are told you have to give up 30 SWCs to get the PayPal $6.  That seemed a bit lopsided to me. 

The chance to help out with various causes appeals to me but I have not figured out what needs to be done to participate in these.  If I‚Äôm going to lose SWCs I‚Äôd rather lose them for a good cause. 

For now I just keep racking up daily points It‚Äôs a daily boost to my spirit when I get the feedback that I have met my daily goal. I figure I‚Äôll go up another level once I have hit the current mark for 30 straight days.I downloaded this app a little over 5 months ago. It started off great, I would reach and sometimes exceed the amount of steps allowed for the day. And then I upgraded to pay 10SWC a month to maybe earn a few more coins while I work (I work in the kitchen so I‚Äôm moving around and working all day). For the past month or so I get cheated out of THOUSANDS of steps everyday and now I can‚Äôt even get close to the steps allowed for the day. I actually enjoyed walking because of the app and it‚Äôs offers for today, but I can‚Äôt really enjoy if I‚Äôm continuously get cheated. I worked an almost 13 hour shift today, how I only walk 12,000 steps and only earned 4.52. Also, it occasionally restarts the app(when I go to look on another app) as if you never opened it today so I get cheated out my coins because of that I believe. I‚Äôll keep it for another week to see if something will fix itself but if not I will not hesitate to delete this app. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGreat app but why are the items always sold out?? I have these coins to spend but nothing to spend them on because the items are sold out every time I open the app.  It would be great to receive some feedback about this because it‚Äôs frustrating to see that somehow others have acquired the items and yet they‚Äôre sold out even at the time of the shop switching items, thank you",0,DrKP1960Xpress1020Gabe109,3 Months and Going StrongPretty decent app at first....Cool app!

Period version tells/reminds you if you‚Äôve closed the program & you‚Äôre not earning steps. However, the new app doesn‚Äôt notify you and even without shutting down, it doesn‚Äôt seem to count steps while the app is running in the background. Lastly, it says it supports iwatch 2 and later, but I‚Äôve taken several steps with just my watch and watch+iPhone but none are being credited - no instructions or troubleshooting guide on iwatch makes it frustrating, too.I‚Äôve had this for 3 years now. They originally had some ok rewards that you had to save for. They‚Äôve gotten rid of those completely. I do not want just a %off of some subscription site. There are almost NO physical products and no gift cards. Then you get sound standard response from them saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt seen anything you liked yet but our rewards are new everyday‚Äù no. They‚Äôre not. They're trash. In the app it asked for feedback but only if you like it. If you hit the sad face and try to give feedback it says ‚Äúcheck your Internet connection‚Äù I‚Äôm done ‚Äúwaiting and hoping‚Äù for better things. There are plenty of other apps I actually earn things from. Do better.You can receive these discounts just by going to the website of these companies. I don‚Äôt understand  the point of this app. 
 I watch ads and the app farms data from me and all I get is regular sign up promotions I could have gotten on my own without making money for a company who‚Äôs whole business model is to mislead their customers. Cool, cool. 

*** I was asked by the app to rate their ‚Äúmarket place‚Äù. I chose thumbs down and the app won‚Äôt accept the rating, due to ‚Äúinternet connection issues‚Äù but when I tapped the thumbs up button, it went through immediately. This company is a huge scam and not worth supporting. You get NOTHING and they make money.With the current crypto market, one would assume they could take the cryptocurrency they earn here and use it as a means of funding actual investments. If there was a way to get this to happen I‚Äôd certainly look at this as something more beneficial. Not to mention, the only way to get actual money from the platform is to invite enough people to join to unlock certain achievements. But the way social media is going, there is to many ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù so of course they can get the highest achievements easily, but must people can‚Äôt. If i could get my sweat coin to convert to cryptocurrencies that actually make money I‚Äôd have no complaints.If I could give zero stars I would. So I went on a walk outdoors and I got 12,000 steps. I went to check on how many I earned and it said zero. I thought that it might‚Äôve been a connection error because I wasn‚Äôt on WiFi but I was using my data. I went home, connected to WiFi, checked sweatcoin, and it still said that I had earned zero coin. When I checked where it was converting my steps I saw that it said analyzing my 2000 steps automatically, but it still came out to zero coins. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not giving me my coins when I clearly walked outdoors and it was counting my steps the whole time. Can a developer tell me what‚Äôs going on because this is some bs.Sort of the point of this app is the offers after you get coins right?  How does that work if the offers don‚Äôt even open, ever on any connection? I try after every app update and after every os update. That has been the only consistent thing in this app, that the offers don‚Äôt open.  Then the other thing is the offers that aren‚Äôt really offers to anything that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere....just saying I know that some of these offers are just the referral links that these companies offer all over the place....should I mention the nerfed calculation? I pretty much walk 15 miles a day outdoors according to any other app so yeah.....This app is TERRIBLE! First off, it doesn‚Äôt remotely come close to accurately calculating your steps. I mean i did 18,000 steps and it calculated less than 10,000. I understand room for error but that‚Äôs ridiculous. Customer care is no help even after sending screenshots. Lastly, the prizes that you would actually want are upwards of 15,000 sweatcoins. This app is great if you are a social media influencer or big blogger bc you get get referrals, so your coins add up fast even if you never take a step. If you are a regular person like me, Do yourself a favor and download another app that won‚Äôt take you 4yrs to actually get something you really want.For me this application is a waste of time and money. The offers are impossible to reach as they sell out in a blink of an eye. I don't know why I pay the $4.99 they charge to have the premium if I still can't get any offer that I like. To complete this review, the application is not running as it should. It freezes and doesn't let me get any reward. Anyways random rewards always give you a penny. Around social networks there is talk that this application turns your steps into money but I already discovered that it is false. Truly a complete disappointment.I know another review mentioned but I take many steps per day and not getting full credit or it ‚Äòmaxes‚Äô out my steps or in some cases no conversion at all?? 
People trying to game your app is not my problem. I‚Äôm walking the steps and you DID ask for access to my IPhone Health app and if the purpose wasn‚Äôt to verify my steps, then what? I‚Äôm giving this another two weeks for your app to correct these errors and credit EVERY step I take each day and explain why you wanted access to my Health app or I delete this bogus tool and dog it completely (and consistently )on Social Media.

They have a list of requirements to receive an offer before you buy it with your Sweatcoin, (US resident, agree to terms, etc.) but these were not included.

You think you‚Äôre earning free money just by walking around outside, but here‚Äôs the catch; the items you can purchase with your Sweatcoins still demand some of your own money for shipping, membership, etc. and you end up getting sucked into something you thought was a good deal, but I‚Äôve checked multiple times and they probably save you only $2 at most.
I‚Äôve read soooo many reviews saying that Sweatcoin ripped them off after they had already spent their unfairly earned coins for ‚Äúprizes‚Äù and when they tried to fix the problem with Customer Service, they never picked up, never returned phone calls, kept getting transferred to person after person, you name it. (I don‚Äôt say unfairly earned lightly, you could participate in 5 marathons in a day and they would only give you about $2 worth of coins) Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt experience this first hand because I was saving my coins for the ultimate price; $1,000. And I‚Äôm so glad I deleted the app before I invested too much time into it, because I would have been furious!!
ALSO, they track your location 24/7 to continuously count the steps you take every hour of every day, but honestly that is just straight up sketchy....Not worth it. ANDDDD they force you to keep the app running so it can be on in the background, lurking, tracking, and watching your every move. How creepy is that???This app is just a means of tracking you for free, and I will tell you why. The prizes take an extraordinarily long time to reach, even if you are walking the maximum amount each day. There is a $1000 PayPal prize which the app says is available after 18 MONTHS, but even if you are on the highest subscription, it would take you about 3 YEARS to earn this reward unless you referred the app to a ton of friends for 5 sweatcoins each. 3 years of data on how much you walk, how much all of your friends walk, and where. In the meantime you are left with some truly mediocre rewards (granted, I‚Äôve been on it for a day), forcing you to keep walking to try to earn an iPhone, gift card, or television . If you walk inside, the steps aren‚Äôt counted, but the app will still be tracking you without giving you sweatcoins. If you aren‚Äôt earning anything for being tracked then you should close the app to save your data/battery, right? Sweatcoin doesn‚Äôt think so. It will ping you with a notification saying ‚ÄúYou killed me! üò≥ Do not force quit me if you want to generate sweatcoins. Tap here or walk 1000 m to restart me.‚Äù This guilts people into constantly have the app running in the background all the time, which allows the company to gather GPS data and analyze your daily whereabouts without rewarding you. DO NOT download this app. Sell your GPS data to a company instead.UPDATE-
I changed my review to one star because i have not received my order, made months ago, and after i reached out to CS, I‚Äôve heard nothing. It‚Äôs only $20 but I‚Äôve learned my lesson. 

My daughter put me onto this app because I am a serious runner and walker. Every day I don‚Äôt use this app and I‚Äôm up to near $500 in a short time. My issue with this app has nothing to do with my earnings but with the items that I should be able to purchase with my earnings. They sell you with the idea of earning these dollars or coins to purchase things but you never are really purchasing something. Everything is a percentage off. I‚Äôm buying coupons. And the fact that I‚Äôm not able to purchase only blows Mia more when I see that the things that I do want are always sold out. What I would like to have is never available. Ever. If you have a lot of people purchasing, you should have more available. Especially if you‚Äôre always selling out. If not, then it‚Äôs set up and a scam to me. Lastly if I‚Äôm only able to get so much off, maybe if it‚Äôs worth it I‚Äôll do it. But shipping is way too high. And I‚Äôve already purchased one item and it hasn‚Äôt even shown up yet. It‚Äôs been over three weeks. No tracking information. Nothing. You have to do better.Is anyone talking about how none of these deals are specific to sweat coin? You can get the same deals that are being advertised on the Sweatcoin app if you go to the product‚Äôs website that is being advertised. 
For example, if Sweatcoin posts an ad for BarkBox being 50% off  your first box with sweatcoins, the same deal is running if you just go straight to BarkBox‚Äôs website‚Äîmaking sweatcoins value at zero.
This process seems obvious but this app advertises itself to make it look like sweatcoins are some kind of actual currency.

The only thing that made it seem somewhat like a substitute currency was the ability to donate sweatcoins for fundraisers, which I don‚Äôt see anymore. I wish we could see data that directly proves some sort of finances are being donated to these fundraisers from the users of this app. Is it? Is this app doing anything besides just tracking my steps? This is literally the second review I‚Äôve written for anything in my life. So congratulations Sweatcoin for being so worthless that I felt the need to write about it to warn other people.I have had this app for over 5 years. I was lured by the ability to collect coins from walking and running outside, with the possibility of getting cool prizes.  I now have over 18,000 Sweatcoins.  You can get discounts on junkie items, but the app offers the same discounts you can get anywhere on the Internet without downloading an app that tracks all your data.  You ‚Äúthink‚Äù there are offers for gift cards.  That is a total scam.  I have been checking multiple times per day for years to see when a gift card is available, and the answer is NEVER.  SOLD OUT.  SOLD OUT.  SOLD OUT.  Really?  Am I that unlucky, or is it a scam?  

You can collect Sweatcoin from watching 3 ads per day.  Most of the ads are from Chinese game manufacturers that claim they are endorsed by major celebrities and PayPal.  Google ‚ÄúOprah endorsement scam‚Äù.  These are the kinds of ads you will see.

I have a friend at PayPal and he said they are constantly suing companies like Sweatcoin for using their likeness without their permission.  They DO NO give permission to use their likeness in video games.

The last item of note is you can donate your Sweatcoin to causes.  In my cynical mind, these are probably scams, as well.

Protect your data.  Save your time.  Don‚Äôt waste it on this data-tracking app.  It‚Äôll save some of your battery life as well as this needs to be open at all times to count.  There is no prize at the end of the tunnel.Okay so I‚Äôve had this app for a while now, I wanna say over a year. I have around $480 in Sweatcoin- which is good I guess. But it‚Äôs been tracking my location this whole time. I‚Äôm assuming selling my data as well, because every time I swipe up to delete the app in the background it says ‚Äúoh Sweatcoin can‚Äôt run if you swipe it off the screen‚Äù.. takes a good amount of battery life. And for what? I‚Äôve not gotten a single ‚Äúprize‚Äù - if you could call them that.. it‚Äôs mainly just ‚Äú25% off‚Äù or ‚Äú50% off‚Äù things you have to BUY in the first place- and don‚Äôt forget the expensive shipping associated with every prize. There isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúprize‚Äù that is totally free. For an app that‚Äôs using your info to make money, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd give out decent prizes but I guess not. I‚Äôll just stick to my reciept apps, at least they don‚Äôt have to be running every second of the day to make me a tiny amount of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù or coins. SmhThe Sweatcoin they give you are useless. The actual tangible items like gift cards or electronics are gone IMMEDIATELY and the auction stuff is way past what you can ever acquire the normal way. I run 20-30 miles a week and average 15-20k steps a day. I‚Äôve the course of non stop tracking I have 6500 sweat coins and have never spent one. Most auctions end at 30-35k Sweatcoin for like Dyson fans or a 250$ gift card. The only thing you can really buy is like 20% off some mail order make up thing you have never heard of or a one month free trial of some work out app. It‚Äôs ridiculous, it‚Äôs just a trick to get you to sign up for recurring service or advertising for some useless make up or plastic jewelry stuff. You will never be able to get anything worthwhile with the Sweatcoins. Just don‚Äôt download this, just use the fitness tracker on your smart watch and save the space on your phone.So I‚Äôve used this app for a couple of years. The stuff you can actually get are nothing but coupons and they‚Äôre usually nothing anyone would really ever want. AMAZINGLY, anything that you could just purchase with ‚Äúsweat coins‚Äù like AirPods , gift cards etc is sold out before you can ever even get a chance to get it. Oh and don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs thousands of them, there‚Äôs like 25. I really don‚Äôt think these are real products anyways and I‚Äôm sure the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who actually were able to purchase them are 1) made up or 2)Set up by the actual sweat coin employees. Pretty sure this is nothing more than a tracking app that sells your info off. So in short, this is really worthless, that is unless you like a free month of Apple Music or 60% off of some overpriced headphones that don‚Äôt even carry a brand name. Not sure why apple hasn‚Äôt shut down this app.I‚Äôve been on SC for several years and it used to be way better. The upgrade options were great, the tracking and conversion was great, no products were ever out of stock. Everything changed 2-3 months ago. Steps and your data are tracked but garbage conversion rates in return. Reaching out to customer service only gets you boiler plate responses blaming your phone. You only can do free or premium ($$) now. Products you can buy with sweatcoins are always, and I mean ALWAYS, out of stock. I literally got an item just in December. All sweatcoin except shipping, great experience. There is never anything in stock now. It‚Äôs like they put up graphics of products they don‚Äôt even have and just put ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù on them to make it look nicer on the shop page. 
It‚Äôs a shame. It‚Äôs gone completely downhill.I work at a clinic and power walk up and down the hallways daily ... I started to notice that my fit bit was accurately tracking my steps but Sweatcoins was not!  One day I worked and after work I went power walking at my favorite track and all day it gave me 400 steps and that was including doing 2 1/4 miles at at the track ... it was so frustrating as I was putting in all the effort and the sweatcoin app was soooo inaccurate! So after MONTHS someone reacts and I sent a message about this ages ago.  I would like to transfer all my Sweatcoins to my Grandson since he is the one who encouraged me to join.  How do I do that?  I don‚Äôt think I want anything to do with the app itself any longer.  Please respond this time.  Since I can‚Äôt give a negative number ... I‚Äôll only give 1 star.  And now EVERY nick name I choose IS TAKEN ... really?!I walked over 14,000 steps that were not counted for. Then I went when to look for help, I looked under the 'Help' category to see if they can re-count my steps again to convert. They have a lack of accountability to compensate you for the steps Sweatcoin is liable for. 

When I e-mailed them, their response said that I needed to ""check the 'Help' section because they don't have enough time to check all their e-mails,"" yet, they have an email account designed for support. 

That never answered my concern. This is app HAD a great idea but the designers along with App Support are terrible because they can never be held accountable, if your steps can't be recorded. They consistently recycle these lies; make FAKE accounts associated with the app to create FAKE REVIEWS. 

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this app, as you can walk 14,000 steps consistently and not have them recorded since the administrators are bunch of lazy snakes that fail.

Imagine you take a test and score near the top 1% and the grade cannot be converted because of an issue on the teachers end. Would you be satisfied? Yet, they have enough time to e-mail everyone weekly about how high they are rated on a walking scale...I‚Äôve had this app for yrs now. I‚Äôve downloaded and deleted the app over the years I‚Äôve had it. Yes it does track you step but not each one which is perfectly fine with me. I‚Äôve collected over 1500 steps. One day I decided to purchase a watch with the sweat coin money. And the only thing I had to do was pay for shipping. Which was around $5-$10 dollars. I made the purchase back in May of this year. It is now July and I still haven‚Äôt gotten my watch. I have sent emails regarding the situation and have gotten no feedback whatsoever. The tracking is over a month old with no updates. It does not show where your package is located at all. It‚Äôs very frustrating because I still had to use my own money to purchase items which I never received!!!Why even have customer service if they just refer you to their FAQ guides or tell you contact your phone supplier if there are issues with step tracking. This app has performed very poorly since iOS 13 was released. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but on my phone it was stopped registering sweatcoin-eligible steps altogether (although it accurately reads total steps). However when I contacted customer service they completely deflected to Apple and that my internal GPS could be malfunctioning without that effecting other apps. Lolol they did not know that I‚Äôm a former Apple technician, their excuse was complete BS. I just deleted the entire app, this was the third time that I‚Äôve reached out to them with a technical issue only for them to deflect blame somewhere else.My wife and I walk together every night and recently I‚Äôve been getting screwed over. She gets paid $3 for our walk and I got .10 cents. I‚Äôm walking between 5k-7k steps every night but I‚Äôm getting ripped off drastically. We have the same phones and the same setup so I‚Äôm not understanding what the issue is other than you guys being cheap. You bit off more than you can chew with this app and now you‚Äôre screwing us so you don‚Äôt have to pay up. Too many bugs in the app too. Always complaining about force quits and it don‚Äôt even count the steps when it‚Äôs on. And the videos load SOMETIMES . Like if your streak is too long the app automatically crashes on the videos. Ending whatever streak you had.Every time I go to get my daily streak coin(s) a 60 second+ ad pops up with no option to skip. I don‚Äôt have the time to be sitting around minutes for an ad to go away. This app already has subscription users and does not need these insanely long ads. I honestly might just delete if this gets any worse. I hate ads and don‚Äôt expect an app that I should only be spending a few seconds on a day to force me to sit through multiple long ads. Sweat coin is already an app that takes so long for so little pay off and not many store items, this addition of ads is plain stupid of them to do. I‚Äôve seen this happen with apps before and if they don‚Äôt turn it around they‚Äôre going to lose users.Yay we get indoor and even space steps now. That would be great if I could actually get all that... It was working fine before now it's just stuck.
I followed the instructions but I can't figure out how to ""turn it on"" cause it's already on. It's already tracking my steps and location and is connected to health. It also won't appear in the""Location Services"" tab.
I have an iPhone 6 currently. I missed out on a bunch of steps past couple days I could have gotten. Sad.
EDIT: Aw, too bad. Notice I said I have an iPhone 6 not 7. Does that affect anything?? You know what. Y‚Äôall prob won‚Äôt see this anyway it‚Äôs okay. Guess I can‚Äôt use your app anymore even if I wanted to. Bye.Had this app at one point, I don‚Äôt recommend just because it consumes a lot of battery because it is always running, for how much of your battery it‚Äôs always taking, plus for the fact the app usually only gives you 1/5th the steps you actually take (if your lucky) it‚Äôs not really worth it, it is still the same way after all this time having uninstalled it. It takes a while to save up for rewards from your coins so you deal with these inconsistencies/inconveniences for long periods of time before you can redeem anything. Your better off just tracking your fitness with another app unless your THAT motivated by the little rewards it offersI got a refund for my subscription because this app has completely stopped awarding ANY Sweatcoin for my steps. Zero. It‚Äôs tracking my steps fine, sometimes tens of thousands in a day, but they‚Äôve completely stopped paying out. I‚Äôve followed all of their troubleshooting steps. Their customer service is garbage and nothing is ever in stock in the ‚Äústore.‚Äù Save your money and a headache and do not bother with this trash scam. 

APPLE: Please investigate these guys. I‚Äôve already lodged a formal ‚ÄúReport a Problem‚Äù complaint for misleading and false advertising. They are money-grabbing crooks. Get them kicked off your store.1. Drains Battery,because it always has to be running

2. Takes forever to accumulate points unless you make a it a part time job trying to refer people to sign up.

3.The offers are üëéüèø when it comes to what the offer is and the price of sweatcoins it cost.
 
4. The offers are misleading a lot of them are just getting you a percentage off of an item which is a part of  a third party subscription site. Example: it can take you months to get 100 sweat coins then you want to use it on a fragrance offer. Then it turns out the fragrance offer is scent bird ‚Äúfree 1st month‚Äù so now you have to subscribe (put a credit card down), pay shipping and handling still and remember to cancel. Who wants to create another bill? Especially when subscriptions like that already do their own pricing ‚Äúspecials‚Äù for new subscriptions.

5. It‚Äôs a big brother sort of deal always tracking where you go. Don‚Äôt waste your battery life and most importantly your TIME!The app is fun to use, easy to rack up points. When you go to cash out the points tho, buyer beware. You usually have to pay shipping which doesn‚Äôt bother me, but lately the products haven‚Äôt been showing up. You never get tracking numbers, orders still not delivered after a month plus get blamed on USPS error, ‚Äúcheck with your post office.‚Äù I get that this isn‚Äôt directly related to SWEATCOIN but you‚Äôd think they would do better to make sure they‚Äôre partnering with quality brands. After walking this road 3 times, it got deleted. I gave it the old college try, but I‚Äôm out.The new indoor update advertises taking you from 60% to 90% of tracking your daily steps. 
The old version goes by gps, the new goes by steps and is connected to an other step app in your phone. 
For me, I went from earning my max or almost my daily max to earning nothing or under 1sc a day. 
GPS tracks my movement with my phone in my backpack or however I‚Äôm carrying the phone.  Now, having my phone in my pocket or back pack does not count/track on the update. 
Also, I can find a way to switch back to gps tracking only. 
This may not be a problem for everyone, but for me, my phone is never in a spot(leg) to gage motion of steps. The old version tracked nearly all my steps. The new version does not track my outdoor steps. Extremely unfortunate and where nearly all my daily steps come from. 
I‚Äôm really disappointed in the upgrade. If it actually worked, it‚Äôd be awesome. But, it doesn‚Äôt work.The App offers points that can be used to buy products, but to buy the products, you have to pay shipping. No problem, except, sometimes the products don‚Äôt arrive, and there is no way to rectify this: No customer service, not order tracking, no direct way to contact vendor to inquire on order. I‚Äôve lost over $20 on an item that would have cost me, maybe $60, had I bought it in the store, but instead, I received nothing but egg on my face for sending money over an App with no customer support.This app is such a waste. The prizes are bad, you get ripped from prizes you deserve because the steps are poorly tracked and the emails are so scammy. I haven‚Äôt opened the app in months but I‚Äôll get emails that I‚Äôm ‚Äú33% more active and in the top 10%!!‚Äù despite not opening the app. 

The prizes are either discounts you could get from the partner company directly or are tens of thousands of steps that will take you years (or ultramarathon training) to achieve.

Mostly, its coupons and auctions, which, if youre not mostly invested in tracking, you just wont win the auction, which is par for the course on any app that uses digital currency to exchange for auction tokens. Youll soend more getting tokens than you will winning auctions unless you live on your phone and in this app. Same is true for gift cards. Unless you pay attention every waking moment, prepare to be disappointed to see ‚ÄúSold Out‚Äù all the time. Which is a shame, because it really feels like a penalty when in reality, its a supply-side issue, or at worst, a bad business model. Either way, Im saving up sweat coins and waiting to see if my experience improves. I have a job that keeps me busy and moving around a lot. Which is the upside to having this app. But if all I can do is donate and buy coupons and always miss out on the gift cards, well, that seems like a waste of effort.I‚Äôve had this app since 2018 and it was good at first, tracking steps and deals were ok but it was a new company so I thought I‚Äôd see improvement over time. However, it has been quite the opposite. Firstly, it has be charging me a monthly Sweatcoin fee for the past 1.5 years for a premium account (I walk a lot) but has not been converting any of my step during that time. I‚Äôve only seen a decrease in my balance since Aug 2021 (now Jan 2023). Also, the more enticing offers are either always unavailable or require an absurd amount of sweatcoins compared to the conversion rate. At this point I only really use it as a step counter but tbh there‚Äôs better apps out there specifically designed for that. One good thing is that there‚Äôs a widget option which is nice, but compared to everything else, kinda seems like a waste of phone storage.The app is constantly wanting to be left open to track steps which is fine if it didn‚Äôt constantly drain the battery. Not only does it drain your phone but if you have a Apple Watch it drains it even worse. It doesn‚Äôt have the option to run in the background and track on the Apple Watch. Then it doesn‚Äôt track your steps correctly and you lose a lot of steps. I‚Äôve been tracking almost 5,000 steps a day for over 3 weeks and it hasn‚Äôt converted any steps but it will show me how many steps I‚Äôve walked. March 22nd was the last day it converted steps. The rewards are great and the app encourages you to get up and move. But something needs to be done with it draining the phone and watch batteries and the capability to correctly track steps and be done while running in the background and not having the app open all day everyday.If you don‚Äôt have a separate fitness tracker, then perhaps this app could be of value to you, extra motivation to get outside. Otherwise, skip this app and just rely on your Fitbit, etc...

Any of the rewards worth shooting for would require 2 years or more of 20k verified steps per day, if they are even still available once you amass the coins.  Most ‚Äúrewards‚Äù are like 5 coins for a one month trial of some app, and you can get a free one month trial anywhere. 

 A cool new feature is the charity donation option, but at 8 million coins to unlock a $3k donation, this values sweat coins at about 27 coins to the penny. Not really worth the effort.

The big issue with the app is the fickleness of the step algorithm.  Today I walked 3 miles around our neighborhood, but the app decided only 44 of my 6000 steps were valid.  The indoor tracking is a nice idea, but you are relying on your iPhone step counter, which misses most indoor steps anyway.  Yesterday, my Fitbit recorded 5k steps around the office, but iPhone only recognized 1k, and sweat coin only verified about 300.

Nice idea , but poor execution.  I suspect the issue is that the business mode does not generate enough revenue to fund real rewards or valuable charity donations.Let me start off by saying I coach track, so I‚Äôm outside a huge part of my day, and I get close to 20,000 steps per day. Sweat Coin has yet to ‚Äúregister‚Äù more than 1000 for me in a day. Now granted, I‚Äôve only had it a week, but I have seen no difference day to day. The algorithm they have is faulty at best, and is a downright cheat at worst. Honestly, it seems like they are blame shifting by automatically saying that they won‚Äôt allow cheating, but consistently cheat their users out of thousands of steps every day. Tracking my data comes at a price, and it‚Äôs not very high: fairness. You have cool deals, and fun offers, but you make it impossible to achieve them. 

Overall, setup is clean and user friendly, but the operating system that calculates steps is anything but. I‚Äôll give it another week, but am not very hopeful.I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 years and have been dutifully tracking my steps, but other than slowly accumulating a fake currency, I don‚Äôt really see much value from using it. The boost feature is the last straw: the app gets stuck on the ‚ÄúChecking‚Äù screen if I forget to open the app the same day as when I initiated the boost. The only way to get around that is to completely delete the app and reinstall it. I‚Äôve had to do this 3 times already, but since none of the prizes or auctions are appealing to me, I‚Äôve decided to give up on this app. (They used to have a $2,000 cash for 20,000 Sweatcoins reward, but that was taken off the marketplace a while ago.) It‚Äôs too much hassle for too little reward.At first the app tracked well but within a week or so once I really started to commit to tracking my steps for the raffles and competitions, the app basically stopped tracking my steps. I‚Äôve tried to contact support like how it instructs but it always just brought me to essentially a void of nothing and I don‚Äôt receive any confirmation that my compliant was even send/received. I even sent an email which did warn me it might take a while for a response, but  months later I did not get an answer so I just gave up. If they accurately recorded my steps I would have stayed but with all this the experience was basically ruined.I‚Äôve been using this app for the better part of the year. I average about 7k steps a day, and managed to rack up 2000 sweat coins over the last year. But I‚Äôd say for the last two months, at least once a week, I don‚Äôt get the coins that register. I‚Äôm currently going through a two day streak of not getting the coins. I usually just let it go, because the following day I will get my coins. I contacted customer support one time and they never got back to me. I followed all their steps about deleting the app, Force closing it, checking my GPS status with another app etc. still nothing. I‚Äôll probably be deleting the app by the end of the day if I don‚Äôt hear back.First off, if you thought you were getting paid big money for walking you played yourself. This app great at tracking your steps letting you know accurate information. But if you have and iPhone, you can do the same on the health app. The health app might not have rewards listed when you get a certain amount of steps but the amount the rewards are set to is near impossible to reach. I have 300k plus steps (I walk everyday) and I started in the month of January of 2018 and I still can‚Äôt get any of the rewards with 300 plus coins . Now you can get a subscription to get more steps which is just stupid.This app counts some steps... however even with battery saver it will drain your battery at a noticeable rate. They were supposed to release an update to count indoor steps. I thought great I do a lot of indoor working for my job and such I‚Äôll pick the app up again. Rip. Horrible step tracking. Maybe 600 steps for every 12k that I take and it only tracks outdoor steps. Most of my sweat coins have been generated through ads which you have to watch a full minute of ads if it‚Äôs not glitching out for usually only .5 to 1 sweat coin. Not very impressed. If the count was even half accurate I would rethink my rating.I very much like the concept of this app. I would like to see additional improvements on the tracking.  The app needs to force send the steps accumulated at the end of the day even if they are less than 2000 accumulated. Don‚Äôt rely on the user to force send them at night. Also, if I have the app running steps should update automatically.  I had 8800 plus steps outside yesterday that did not convert. I had the app running in the background. I could see that it was open but the steps did not convert when I look at history.The main problem with this app is that the sweat coins you accumulate are of very little value. Sometimes they have a good prize but they are so few and sell out too quickly, which means they only offer a small amount. I log in every morning and see a new item that can be purchased with sweat coin but it is always sold out. They need to offer more for the sweat coin. As of now, there is no point for these sweat coins.
It is ok for tracking your steps, but not the most accurate.Your first few months it works good but then I stops tracking your steps. I went on a fishing trip and was out fishing for 6 hours and when I checked my steps for that day it said I only had 41, And that is just one encounter. I work a job that requires a lot of walking and the most I get for a full day is just 1000 steps. When I used to average at 19,000. Very disappointed with it now, can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a waste of my time because I‚Äôd be walking anyway but it did give me false expectationsI‚Äôve just downloaded the app and, immediately, I‚Äôm having an issue. I cannot enable indoor step tracking. I‚Äôve followed the instructions exactly as written, I‚Äôve restarted the app a few times, and then even uninstalled/reinstalled it just to be sure. Still won‚Äôt work. Judging by some other reviews, I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this.

I‚Äôm looking forward to using this, as I do spend some time outside at work, but I‚Äôm disappointed that my indoor walking (90% of my day) won‚Äôt be counted. I‚Äôll happily raise my rating once this issue is addressed.",0,EmElJeescoop di poopDrgnLuvrSeraphysLope48cluelessbluesMe is playingIMACARTOONNard235Richity richPlee64Toranosuke76killerb0iCammySays,"Still deciding if worth premium costStarted out promising but is kinda sus nowApp is a battery drainer but decent rewardsPoor step algorithm - few rewards worth the effortHas promise, but fails to deliverTiredBad tracking and no supportUnresponsive technical supportPennies for walkingApp needs workConcept great - needs some workNot worth itCool until it‚Äôs notNo indoor steps",Sweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,2,0,1899,has_tracking,56

Figured this one was worth writing because I actually do like this app. There limited things to purchase and any things worth purchasing seem extremely out of reach. However, it‚Äôs all free so hoping they increase their options one day.

My biggest disappointment in this app is the step converter. I walk all day during work and I easily break 5k steps per day. With the free version, I maxed this out 3 days in a row and al my steps converted just fine. Since I surpass this amount on a daily basis, I upgraded my account to get 10k stars per day. As soon as I upgraded, I got zero steps for pretty much every day after (about 2-3 weeks worth). I got all the updates, I opened the app frequently (and have always tracking turned on in settings) and still nothing. I then canceled my upgrade yesterday and boom... my steps began converting again. Not sure what‚Äôs going on !74 quite disappointed. I feel like I lost out on 140k steps fo no reason. 

Anyways. It‚Äôs all free so whatever, but for the broken converter I give it 3 stars.So I have two basic complaints 
1. It doesn‚Äôt truly count steps wish there was a way to connect to Fitbit or Apple Watch - so because it‚Äôs get somewhere between 1/3 to 2/3 of the steps and for people like me who don‚Äôt always carry their phone with them can account for the steps they‚Äôve taken. 
2. The stupid message that pops up when you accidentally close the app. Okay I get it. It happens. But there is absolutely no reason for it to be there. But if you don‚Äôt click on the accept button then it won‚Äôt count steps. Lost an entire day of steps due to that. 
I would love to give it a higher score but those two things are reasons enough to keep it at a 3 for me.I wish I could give this app 5 soil stars but I can‚Äôt. I have an iPhone for starters sweatcoin isn‚Äôt always counting my steps  while walking I was watching the counter it wasn‚Äôt tracking my steps it lags and the counter starts going fast I‚Äôm sure it missed a lot of steps.
Next I‚Äôm disappointed in the things you can use your coins for, I‚Äôd much more prefer to be able to transfer it to a card like pay pal and have the cash instead of the gifts. I have also donated to some of the charities on here which I don‚Äôt mind but I‚Äôd prefer to have the cash once again the options for things are not the best.Works great when I am holding the phone and walking, but there is no way to turn on location in settings for my Apple Watch as the app does not appear in the list! In order to use the app via Apple Watch, it says to enable location services on iPhone. How is this possible!? Without the ability to use the watch, the app is pointless as I rarely carry my phone around all day. I use my watch for activity tracking.I‚Äôve been a user for about 4 months now and every day the items you can actually purchase with sweat coins are always out of stock, I check avidly throughout the day and I can still never catch anything while it‚Äôs still in stock..

The main one being the app‚Äôs weird anger at being ‚Äúforce quit‚Äù.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense why to me.  It has location tracking on all the time anyway so it should not be an issue to close to app.  The app needs to chill.  It also seems to get pointlessly angry if I just look at how many sweatcoing I got, leave the app WITHOUT force closing it and come back sometime later that day after it closing on its own because I used apps or some time has passed. For inexplicable reasons the app docks you sweat coins for this behavior and it‚Äôs just obnoxious to the point of me dropping a star.I like this app a lot but it does cheat you sometimes. For example a few days ago I got over 12,000 steps on my Fitbit according to the Fitbit app. But on Sweatcoin I only got around 7,000. Part of it is because it doesn‚Äôt recognize or approve all of the steps but also because I don‚Äôt bring my phone everywhere I go but I do wear my Fitbit basically everywhere. It‚Äôs be really cool if you could connect this app to other tracking apps like the Fitbit and then it could be more accurate. I would appreciate if you looked into this. Thanks!I like it but it‚Äôs almost pointless.
I rack up over 8,000 steps/day and have a lot of sweat coins. But‚Ä¶ I CAN NEVER USE THEM! The ‚Äòshop‚Äô never has ‚Äòpay with sweat coins‚Äô rewards available.

The latest app update seems to have fixed the tracking issue I was experiencing. Thank you very much for reaching out to me about the situation and trying to trouble shoot the issue with me. I really appreciate it. I intend to keep using the app on a daily basis üòä

I don‚Äôt know what happened with the last app update but my app no longer tracks my steps when I leave it open even if I have it open on the app instead of leaving it open in the background. I‚Äôm not walking around my house all day so that isn‚Äôt the issue but it should at least be able to track my steps going to and from my classes and when I go home. Please fix this. I enjoy using the app and I‚Äôm honestly just gunna delete it if the problem doesn‚Äôt get addressed soon because it‚Äôs pointless to have an app that doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs supposed to do. Thank you.It does take a while to accrue Sweatcoins. But it is free. So are you really in that big a hurry? Obviously they are not going to just give you cash for walking. They have to make money to run the app so they make deals with brands, a lot of the time it is weird stuff, but just keep an eye on it every day when you do your free  Daily Reward. I have gotten free trials of two great meditation apps and a pair of yoga pants. I did have to pay $10 shipping for $75 yoga pants. 

TLDR if you don‚Äôt mind it tracking your every move and you are a patient person you might like it.Been using sweatcoin for a couple of month now, but these days is been a but difficult navigating the app. Ain't letting me touch the option like the touch didn't work and i cant go back and forward to other option menu in the app, but is cool cause it keeps tracking my steps, but i want to check my progress with dome challenges, other than that the app is great and the coins tooI have not been able to get any rewards for the last two months.  When I email support they say the same thing each and every time.  Uninstall and reinstall.  I do that, allow for tracking etc. still no reward claims. Tell me I have an error.

But overall I'm very happy with this app, it's exciting to Finnish a streak every 3 days, checking my steps and my earned coins, and just everyday coming back to see what's new on the purchase page. Some improvements that I think the app should consider adding, is to give more opportunities to earn sweat coins DIRECTLY on the app, offer more prizes (in the smaller price ranges like 5-15 sweat coins), and to give more of a reward for the steps counted (bc anyways that is why the app was developed, to get ppl walking outside). Then I would pop back on even more often, and I'm sure thousands of others would too!Genuine coupons from great places! Just got a bark box for $16 dollars when it would‚Äôve been $40. Sweatcoin gives you their currency of ‚Äúcash‚Äù that you earn from walking and you can buy coupons with them and other products. I don‚Äôt excessively walk or workout and I‚Äôm at $299 sweatcoin dollars. I would def give it a shot! You earn pints for referring friends and even just checking in every day. I was tired of apps that ‚Äúsaid‚Äù they gave you stuff for doing things and it took forever to add up or didn‚Äôt at all. Sweatcoin is the real deal!

It‚Äôs a thoughtless process! 10/10I have been using since 2016 and it is one of the apps that helps motivate to move or keep moving. Rewards a real but you need to keep alert because some go fast.

One complaint the recent update was tracking indoor activity but stopped and I hope it can be fixed because sometimes, due to my asthma, I have to workout indoors.I love this app a lot the tracking for steps works very good and i always get the right amount of Sweatcoin as the only thing I wish was different was that in the shop you could buy giftcards or turn your sweat coins into PayPal cash because some of these items in the shop do not seem all that worth it.

NOTE: I've submitted this review MULTIPLE TIMES. Somehow it still has NOT appeared in App storeüßê Why? What are you hiding? 

Really do NOT like the new format for Daily Boost. It sets its own goal. Ignoring what you have set for yourself. And pushes you to walk faster. This isn't supportive of people like myself who have a chronic illness and walking may be our only way to exercise. Just being on our feet may be difficult some days due to pain or other symptoms like vertigo, trouble breathing, etc. And we set goals that are attainable with challenges of our conditions. To have SweatCoin seem to not be considerate of chronic health is very disappointing. The company should be positive toward ALL users regardless of their current health status, ability, etc.The app doesn‚Äôt count all of your steps towards all your goals. For example if you are unlocking a great deal it may say you only had 9000 steps except the sweat coin will have refreshed to reflect that you‚Äôve walked more than 12k which makes no sense. It doesn‚Äôt update properly. My Fitbit also says that I‚Äôve walked more than 15k most days. Sweat coin will shortchange me and say I only did maybe 10k. I‚Äôm not going to move into premium memberships unless that‚Äôs fixed because why am I going to give money to an app developer who can‚Äôt get the free version working correctly. Make it sync between with Fitbit and reflect my actual steps or just be another step counter and lose out. May even delete because of permissions to collect my data. Don‚Äôt need you making money off me if I can‚Äôt be treated with respect.For security concerns with my job and who is actually getting my location data, I don‚Äôt like that the app must always be using my GPS when I only use the app at certain times outdoors. 

Why give the option of ‚Äúwhile using‚Äù if that is a lie? Also, a rise in scammers monetizing the app for personal gain by sending small amounts of coin to beg for more coins in return because they claim they ‚Äú...don‚Äôt know how the game works and they are new.‚Äù Except I can see their activity and they are converting more coin in a day than I do in a week. 

The perks aren‚Äôt plentiful or great. I donated all of my coins to the charities since the coins can‚Äôt buy anything useful anyway. If you do the math on what it takes to realistically hit goals for cash or phones or some of the better perks, it would take years to hit and more than a normal amount of miles even if you work a job where you avg 10 miles a day. Given that steps are dropped, this is beyond frustrating and a futile effort. Either perks run out or they are not fully funded or good. 

Deleting the app. It has been a year and I see no real benefit to let it kill my battery by running my gps constantly. I sent a message about this to the Dev before. Now it isn‚Äôt worth the space it takes up.It‚Äôs really not worth it I wanted this app so I could get myself a treat for working out you know something I could look forward too. Everything is sold out all the time and it doesn‚Äôt count your step accurately.

Update two: I literally had to change my name and password so I wouldn‚Äôt be on here anymore. Please please don‚Äôt download this app once they have you they won‚Äôt let go for any reason don‚Äôt put in personal info!I enjoyed this app a lot but now it‚Äôs boring & i hardly hear anyone talk about it, all of the small prizes are lame hands down they are terrible, & the marathon prizes are ridiculous they want you to do so much like it hard to earn 10 sweat coins a day so how are you going to make 20,000? and the yearly goals as well are pointless you have to walk 10k steps a day for 365 days just to have 3,650 sweat coins so you can have a $50 gift card when i can make $50 a day. I dont think this app should be on the app store anymore. They could at least make sweat coins convertable like bitcoin & watch how many people download this app. But yeah i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to a single soul anymore:(Walked almost 4000 steps and only got 10 cents for it. The only real earnings we can make is by watching the advertisements every day. If you are going to gyp us of our points that we can earn by walking, then you could at least give us better earnings by watching the advertisements every day. I know it‚Äôs not fair to give us more sweat coins for ads but it‚Äôs also not fair that you guys don‚Äôt count thousands of our steps. It‚Äôs a system to get you guys paid by us watching ads and us never being able to reach our goals on this app. I wish less greedy people had thought about this app before these creators did.Since I‚Äôve downloaded this app, I‚Äôve received a million calls from telemarketers and never EVER have before downloading this app. 
My email is littered with fake ads and junk mail now as well as my phone.
Doesn‚Äôt truly or accurately calculate or count steps. 
Kills your battery even in power saving mode.
Goals/rewards for walking are wayyyyy too out of reach. I hike/bike every weekend for miles upon miles with highly inaccurate data and little to no ‚Äúcoins‚Äù for how far I‚Äôve hiked (usually about 12-14 miles).
Hiking gives me almost no coins, on the other hand, downhill mountain biking through technical and super rocky trails seems to give me double steps as well as driving down dirt roads with my phone rattling like crazy in a cup holder.
Have shared this app with many friends and coworkers, all who have said the same things.
Needs a lot of improvement and development before I would ever consider downloading and using again.It was great to have goals to actually want to walk toward. It might have taken forever to get them but eventually you might if you stayed active. The issues is with all the changes they got rid of all of the good rewards. I don‚Äôt want to use my coins to get a free trial to Harry‚Äôs shave club, I can do that on their website already. The prizes are now garbage, there‚Äôs nothing to hope toward, it has truly fallen, and is no longer worth the space on my phone.

This is a great concept, but the app limits you harshly to ensure that you never reach that goal. First of all, they limit the amount of sweatcoins you can earn in a day to 20. You can take 100,000 steps but the app will only give you 20 sweatcoins, the equivalent of 25,000 steps taken. 
They also have a sweatcoin transfer feature where your friends with the app can send you sweatcoins that they‚Äôve earned. Sounds like you can meet your goals twice as fast if you have a friend walking along with you, right? Wrong. You cannot used transferred sweatcoins towards the cash reward. It‚Äôs clear that this app does not want us to actually win money by walking. They hope that people use their app every day and they try to make it take so long to get paid that you just give up before getting there.
This is scam artistry.If you‚Äôre looking for an app to count your steps, this one seems to work great. 
If you want to make money off your steps, this is NOT the app for you. Getting actual money of it takes literally a year (they‚Äôre literally listed as yearly goals.) The rewards you can redeem are more like little discounts (for example one ‚Äúreward‚Äù is the ability to spend $30 on something and then get something free. The $30 comes out of your actual money, not what you‚Äôve earned from the app. I have it downloaded for the step counter and figure I may actually get some extra money eventually.
Oh and, at least for iPhones, indoor steps don‚Äôt count. So you go grocery shopping or to the mall? The app counts the steps, but it won‚Äôt convert them to coins.When I first got this app about 4 years ago I really enjoyed it. There were attainable goals and products you could purchase. I even got enough points for a free pair of sunglasses that I love to this day. Anymore, the physical products are always ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and the digital offers aren‚Äôt even worth spending credits on, because you can find the same offers online with the Honey app for free.

It shows people holding stacks on stacks of money saying ‚Äúget money for walking‚Äù. Nah fam. You get $1,000 if you walk 20k (about ten miles) every day for over a year. After 10k every day for a year, you can maybe afford a $50 gift card to nike, starbucks, or xbox. But that‚Äôs if it counts your steps. Now here‚Äôs where it gets fishy. This app started out working great, I was pulled in by the ads promising money, and though I was disappointed by the pretty hard to reach goals, I decided to give it a shot. It tracked my steps for the most part, but as of these past two weeks it just stopped counting my steps or only gave me half of the sweatcoins I‚Äôve earned. Yes, I have been walking outside. I walked 10k steps last week and got 5 swc. I walked 5k steps for the past week days and got none or 3 swc (only once). I don‚Äôt know what exactly is going on but if this doesn‚Äôt get fixed I‚Äôm gonna delete the app.So i did the math for sweatcoin. And how long it should take you to get the 20,000 swc prizes and yea it takes up to 5 years to get those assuming you‚Äôre using the ‚Äúbreaker‚Äù subscription. (Btw idk why you would implement a subscription for us to pay with our steps monthly it holds us back.) I wanted to save up to get the trip to disney or to france but i did the math and it takes 5 long years of walking 10-15k steps a day. I wish the creators behind this app werent so cheap that they have to make it nearly impossible to get to your goals. But i figure the way the make money is through ads which you get swc off of, and having starter businesses market their products in the app. So kudos to them finding that recipe for lasting wealth. Won‚Äôt be the last app that does thisSo there‚Äôs amazing goals like walk 250,000 steps in a month. Problem is that I don‚Äôt think all my steps are being counted. The counter has had the same total steps for two days. I have moved a lot but it seems none of it counted towards that goal. So I‚Äôm a bit disappointed about that. 

Also the last time I was outside it would not load the 20 min boost for my steps so I missed out that was as well.

I know there‚Äôs been improvements on the prizes and  raffles for gift cards. Some of those are discounts which is nice but it‚Äôs still expensive to get those items. I‚Äôm still waiting on a good prize to use my sweat coins. Definitely don‚Äôt have the amounts needed to bid on anything.  

Overall I‚Äôm satisfied with the app and thinks there‚Äôs room for improvement. My smart watch always says I have move steps than this app has counted.  Please fix that and it would be more enjoyable to see steps add up.I just got this app about a month ago and it was going good I was getting all my steps converted and then it stopped once I got to $113 yesterday I walked 15,000 steps didn‚Äôt get nothing walked another 5000 steps today still nothing converted again along with many other times I have updated the app I have done all the cheats that the app said to do and I have gotten nothing.

BUT I honestly think there should be new upgrades for the year 2020. I strongly believe you guys should turn the sweat coins into cash receiving the money by either cash app, Pay pal or a bank account. Reason being you have those dedicated to this app and it gives so much motivation to push harder than the next goals of steps you have. Well there‚Äôs a few things you guys should update: the items you can SPEND on and there should be like a daily reward you receive. The extra sweat coins from the adds are helpful but, add something more fun like a few mini games or a spin the wheel. I‚Äôm pretty sure you guys make A LOT of money you just have to think bigger sometimes though. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add extra features and I really hope my review goes father than this. Other than that I‚Äôm loyal to sweat coins and I don‚Äôt plan on removing it no time soon because like I said before the motivation of this app is amazing!I see some of the frustrations people are mentioning in their reviews: affect on the battery, actual outside steps not being counted, the difficulty in reaching the goals to buy market items. I have looked at the count as I exited the house to go on a long weekend hike. So I ‚Äúknew‚Äù it didn‚Äôt give me credit for at least a thousand steps. That seems to be the case most days. Even though that is frustrating, I choose to see it as a motivation to do an extra 1k of steps. I am walking anyway to improve my health....so anything I get as a perk or reward is nice. I do wish the app wouldn‚Äôt shut down by itself so often. I need to frequently check it and re-open the app so I won‚Äôt walk a mile without it being counted.

You download the app, set it up, give it access to you gps location and whatever apps it needs to count more steps. Kinda invasive on that part, though. The payout in sweatcoins isn‚Äôt the best ration at the current version of app.

Most steps I have gotten counted was 2259 verified steps and earned only 2.14 sweatcoins on a day the app counted 10,000+ steps. Algorithm needs heavily adjusted on this part. I compare the steps the app does with a high priced step-counter and they are different but not far off from each other. 

Long term goals say 20k sweatcoins, 24 mos of steps and invites but how many invites? Be nice to know that aspect so we can work harder getting people to join in on this.

As far as making purchases, at the present time, nothing has really caught my attention in wanted to test. Most of the items are subscription based. Need to set it up where a featured item/company is weekly but then need 2-3 spots for daily change-outsConsidering everything it‚Äôs a pretty good app!

I was going to give 4 stars, but I changed my mind. I purchased a discount on my next utility bill, but it‚Äôs not offered it my area. I requested a refund of my sweatcoins, and they provided it fairly quickly. Great app!A lot of people in these reviews seem to overlook the base motivation of this app - promoting exercise and going outside. The reward incentives are definitely an amazing plus and great motivator and while it takes a lot of work to ‚Äúearn‚Äù, at the end of the day these rewards are still free. This app is a great motivator to keep working harder and meet goals. While some of these goals do in honesty seem unachievable from a start point, it does provide valuable lessons in working towards simpler short term goals. Great incentivizing app!I love this app, and have been using it with my mother to encourage her to get out and about, but it‚Äôs getting harder to get her excited about things when there isn‚Äôt a reward within tangible distance. This may be a very individual request, but is there a way to get books about fitness added to the rewards system? It would make the for cheaper and more attainable goals, and I for one know that I‚Äôd love to earn a book to read by jogging!I‚Äôve used this app for years now. As a cart pusher I am always interested to see how many steps i do a day(30k). But they should definitely make an option for us to see how many steps we get a month and the year. They do calculate the average steps monthly but also thats the average and not the total. Overall awesome bidding feature and great way to make new goals.Thank You SweatCo! Keep up the excellent work!

After getting over the skepticism, I downloaded this app and learned more about it while testing it out that night. 

I finally downloaded this App in hopes of finding something stimulating enough that I would use that to get out of bed and begin my day. I live with severe ADHD(-C) and after downloading this app I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs flipped my life around but it has helped me manage my destructive behaviors into a healthier lifestyle. 

The Instant Gratification is just what I needed to motivate myself to become more productive and organized and combat my passive rationalizing. As well as helping me visualize goals, set them, and how to achieve them. 

I have consistently used this App for a month and I recommend it to anyone for any reason!Well this app is pretty cool and seems like I can get something out of it but I have been a fit.

Okay- so I‚Äôve started out with sweat coin and there are SO many issues honestly; 1, the accuracy of the tracker only accounts to about 10-25%, which means that of the 7,000 steps I walk in a day I only get the credit for about 5,000 of those- a 2,000 difference. 2, when I finally chose an item ( the asleep gummies for five SWEATCOINS, NOT MONEY), at the checkout I was asked to fill out my credit card information IN DETAIL AND I QUOTE, ‚Äú Enter your name exactly as it‚Äôs written on your card‚Äù. I know I‚Äôve had my moments but c‚Äômon I‚Äôm not an idiot. More into detail upon this subject, when you go to ‚Äú pay‚Äù for said item in specific writing one of the steps claims that a discount will automatically be applied to the purchase, which means that my credit card information isn‚Äôt and SHOULDN‚ÄôT be needed at all!! However this is not the case and NO WHERE in the app is there a discount for purchases related to the app. None. Go look, please.
 I was recommended this app and was told it wasn‚Äôt a scam, however upon further investigation this was proven invalid and completely ridiculous. If something doesn‚Äôt give within the next 24 hours, I‚Äôm deleting the app and having the person who recommended it to me delete it as well.

I open this stupid dumb app every freaking day for 2 years and you  know what I was able to get with all those steps, blood and tears? Air!!

I open this app again today and I started exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms this is the worst app in the history of the human existence and the spiritual one. At first I enjoyed this app because despite practically having nothing of value in the store I enjoyed a few premium pandora accounts and tidal accounts that‚Äôs literally the best thing I have ever gotten. You need to shut this app down until you my able to go to a thrift store or whatever non-profit organization you go to get your free cheap absolutely useless and meaningless items. If I had to choose between my gf having a child while she‚Äô has sweat coin on her phone And saving another persons life a person who doesn‚Äôt have sweat coin I would force my girl to have a abortion so she won‚Äôt have to live with the pain of this app.So the app required you to leave it open at all times for some reason, despite the fact it runs in the background regardless.

The app also only lets you get a maximum of 5 coins per day. You can upgrade, however, to a better plan which lets you get more coins per day. But you have to spend a certain amount of coins per month to get this membership. Example, the highest one lets you get 20 coins per day, at the cost of 30 coins a month. Kinda bad, but it‚Äôs made horrible by the fact it also limits how much you can get per month, which for the highest subscription is 600 coins. What a scam.

None of their offers in the store are good. They all cost a ridiculous amount of coins, like some cost 20,000. Which even if you‚Äôre earning 600 coins a month, it‚Äôs going to take you 3 years to get enough for that. Long story short, those things have never been bought.

The only offers that were affordable look like you‚Äôre going to get something, but it only gives you a coupon for that thing, which is technically false advertising because it only tells you after you spend the coins.

Long story short, this app is an absolute waste of time and you‚Äôre better off putting your sweat in energy into literally anything else. Go become a running coach and make real money if you like to run. This app isn‚Äôt going to give you anything but a number.Five ‚≠êÔ∏èbecause you‚Äôre walking for a good cause: charitable donations

Three ‚≠êÔ∏è because the prizes they advertise are either way too far-fetched (a trip to Paris is about seven years of walking), or kind of useless (free tattoo pens! Booo....)
Two ‚≠êÔ∏èbecause the app doesn‚Äôt count steps done indoors, on a treadmill
One ‚≠êÔ∏èbecause the app doesn‚Äôt APPROVE 100% of all steps, even if every single one of them are walked outdoors. What the hell..DO NOT EVEN BOTHER DOWNLOADING THIS APP!

You can‚Äôt win anything and all the people who were saving up their sweatcoins are stuck with useless coins with nothing to spend it on.

Youll soend more getting tokens than you will winning auctions unless you live on your phone and in this app. Same is true for gift cards. Unless you pay attention every waking moment, prepare to be disappointed to see ‚ÄúSold Out‚Äù all the time. Which is a shame, because it really feels like a penalty when in reality, its a supply-side issue, or at worst, a bad business model. Either way, Im saving up sweat coins and waiting to see if my experience improves. I have a job that keeps me busy and moving around a lot. Which is the upside to having this app. But if all I can do is donate and buy coupons and always miss out on the gift cards, well, that seems like a waste of effort.PRO: The app works good for counting steps and it is true, you get to use sweatcoins towards actual purchases which is great

CON: Unfortunately, I‚Äôve yet to see an item worth having not be labeled ‚Äúsold out‚Äù. It seems everything but digital items is labeled ‚Äúsold out‚Äù. This makes me think there isn‚Äôt actual things to spend your coins on. The digital items, which are easily available, seem to either be referral items which ‚Äúsweatcoins‚Äù earns off you, or free trials and things which are available directly from said sight or through other means. I bought a chevron gift card labeled up to 50% off, it was clearly the same offer I could‚Äôve downloaded from the linked site, and it was only 35% off anyways. 

Long story short, if sweatcoins offered more, it‚Äôd be worth it for giving them your personal information. As of now, I couldn‚Äôt recommend them if you are looking for rewards.So the ONLY reason why I downloaded this app was because I saw it on a Snapchat story of a friends and so I was curious because it sends an instant message which says ‚ÄúCheck this app out it pays you when you walk‚Äù. So I downloaded it and then it told me invite a friend you‚Äôll receive  $5 so I invited and two of them downloaded the app and told me did you get the $5 and yet still have $0 PLUS I‚Äôm a stay at home mom I‚Äôm always walking and out and about with my youngest daughter. And have about 800 steps? Doesn‚Äôt add up? I‚Äôve had this app for about 3 days now I‚Äôm sure using true calculation it wouldn‚Äôt add up... 

Going to tell my friends and sister to just delete the app....Everytime I go to the ‚Äúshopping‚Äù area and click on something I want and I know I can pay for, it just gets stuck trying to load the page. I don‚Äôt think this app is legit because everytime I go to buy something, it won‚Äôt load. I‚Äôll be sitting there for literally a half hour with the app open with it stuck trying to load the item I clicked on. I have a lot of sweatcoins saved up but tbh I think I‚Äôm just going to uninstall this app. It‚Äôs completely useless if I can‚Äôt buy anything! I‚Äôve had this app for months now and it still won‚Äôt let me buy things. It‚Äôs whatever, I‚Äôm sick of it so I‚Äôm deleting it. End of story.I very much like the concept of this app. I would like to see additional improvements on the tracking.  The app needs to force send the steps accumulated at the end of the day even if they are less than 2000 accumulated. Don‚Äôt rely on the user to force send them at night. Also, if I have the app running steps should update automatically.  I had 8800 plus steps outside yesterday that did not convert. I had the app running in the background. I could see that it was open but the steps did not convert when I look at history.",0,EmElJeejjjt2-pSopsusuMarilynnJane420Plee64,Still deciding if worth premium costRewards almost non existentDeceivingDoesn‚Äôt workConcept great - needs some work,Sweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step CounterSweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,5,0,704,has_narrative,21

Customer service helped me when my steps stopped converting to Sweatcoins. But there are bot accounts on here, they always take the gift cards, and if you bid on an item I would recommend waiting until the last second as the bot accounts always places the highest bid. One of the ways you know that an account is a bot, is when you look at their profile and they have absolutely no sweat coins, and no steps history at all. I ran across one this morning placing the highest bid on a Scrabble board. In the end, the free premium trial gives you a good head start because it lets you get 30-31k steps in but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending any real money on this app.The concept is cool but you guys REALLY need to fix the conversion problems. They have been going on for months now. It‚Äôs not that the app isn‚Äôt counting steps but it‚Äôs not converting them to coins. My step history in the app for yesterday shows over 6000 steps but the conversion history shows less than 2000! And before you give me the same answer that isn‚Äôt working for anybody else either... Yes it‚Äôs paired with my watch for ‚Äúmaximum conversion.‚Äù Yes I hard closed and reopened the app. Yes I deleted and reinstalled the app. Yes I toggled the background refresh on and off. Please fix!

Ummm... hello? I said I had already tried that?The gathering of the coins is easy... but having something worth spending it on is a different story. 
They offer lame subscriptions, or something that you end up paying out of pocket for. 
A free scary movie subscription? A discount on your first month of contacts? A discount on a jewelry subscription? I can find these kinds of discounts online. I thought I would be able to reward myself... 

Not very exciting. I can earn like crazy, and spend absolutely nothing.January‚Äôs steps recorded to December, February‚Äôs steps recorded in January  and  all steps taken to date in March are still bring recording in February, despite the conversion history reflecting correct dates. I‚Äôve updated the app, turned all of its settings off & then on again - nothing helps.

While I‚Äôve read that other users take issue with the accuracy of the step count, I have not personally encountered this. I like that I can look back on my stat history. The feature I think could use revamping is the reward system. They sell out lightning fast. The rumor is that they are being bought out by bots. So despite having the app for almost a month, I have not been able to redeem anything. Another added layer of difficulty here is the notifications mainly tell me to spin for bonuses. While I love being reminded of that, it would be very helpful if I could be informed about the gift cards, subscriptions and products just as often. One solution I would suggest is making the majority of offers ongoing. This way users can redeem gift cards and such from a catalogue of options once their step count allows them to reach a certain dollar amount.I agree with most that the fact you can only earn steps walking outdoors is silly. There should at least be a ‚Äúmonthly subscription‚Äù that charges more coins but allows for indoor steps. I work 9 hrs a day and getting outdoor steps is just not feasible (especially during bitter winters). 

Also, the daily reward is buggy. It can take a while for the section to appear and even then, another few seconds for the ad to load. I‚Äôm also having a delay in the conversion history tab. I‚Äôve gotten the daily reward everyday, but it sometimes misses days or skips without giving me the coin.

4,pos,2019-08-28 21:59:50,0,"Sweatcoin is a very smart way to get people  walk or run outside. It can sense when your indoors and outdoors so it only counts steps when you are outdoor. The best part of it is that you can use you sweatcoins after walking/running outside and use it to buy things! Like a 2 month audible subscription or get Tidal Hifi. You can also donate like give to the refugee campaign in sweatcoin to donate to kids in Africa who are in refugee camps. The only thing I find fishy about this app is that how does it covert sweatcoins into real money to get the things in the shop. My guess is it find coupons and applies it after you have spent your sweatcoins. Would like to know the full story of this process, but in the end it is a really good app and I can‚Äôt wait to start running for my sweatcoins!",0,nrjejejudurhr,It‚Äôs gud,Sweatcoin Walking Step Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,155,has_narrative,21

Dissatisfied....i was told about this app and I started seeing other ppl use it so I tried it out since I do a lot of walking.

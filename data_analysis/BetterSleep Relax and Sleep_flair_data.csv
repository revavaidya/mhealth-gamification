I work at night and sleeping in the daytime does provide its challenges. Using this app I can add night time sounds mixed with other sounds that I find relaxing to help me fall asleep in the daytime. This app has also helped me fall asleep faster. I use this app in my car when I am dropping off my niece at her mother's house. It makes her fall asleep and so her mother doesn't have to deal with a fuzzy 3-year old who likes to stay up late. 
Get the app. Totally worth it. The free version of it is top-notch.This -by far- is the best app of its kind. I have tried a half dozen or more offerings for meditation and background sounds. The quality of the sound recordings is superior and the selection of guided meditations is without equal. I have chronic challenges with sleep and the combination of an extensive catalog of meditations and the fantastic sound files offered within this app works so well that I am able to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep more thoroughly.

There's one or two provided each week, which is more than enough to lull me to sleep. However, if you wish to use all of the meditations, you will have to pay. Personally, I haven't looked very far into the prices because I am satisfied with what is given, but I realize that a cost to use more than two meditations per week may turn some people off.

Edit: I'm currently very disappointed. I have been using the Introductory Path to Better Sleep for months on end. Day 5 continuously lulls me to sleep. However, tonight, upon starting the app, I noticed that it is now a pro feature. I am extremely upset. That specific meditation had become a part of my routine, and due to my disability, it is uncomfortable for changes in my routine to take place. And by uncomfortable, I mean, I

I have extremely sensitive hearing and I‚Äôm easily distracted or awakened. There‚Äôs countless combinations of sounds for every occasion. I listen to this app at night, when I need to concentrate, when I need to drown out annoying distractions, and in the background with audio books, etc. At night I listen to a combination of white, pink, and green noise, along with a hint of thunder, rain on the roof, and vinyl. Every sound can be adjusted individually, and the overall volume can be adjusted so that it doesn‚Äôt drown out music or audio books. I‚Äôm particularly impressed with the responsiveness of their customer service. From time to time over the years when I update my phone or the app, the settings get changed and I can‚Äôt figure out how to make it play simultaneously with other audio apps and they always walk me through how to fix it. They‚Äôve even used my feedback to make immediate updates to the app. Like I said, I highly recommend! -Brian,   Plano, TXBetterSleep has been truly inspirational and transformational for me. Before I had this app, I used to listen to guided imagery recordings to help me with sleep. But noe, after using it for almost a year, I can‚Äôt think of a single app that has been as helpful or health-supporting. Before I had this app, I had never tried yoga nidra, and the guided yoga Nidra sessions and series on this app have been life-changing. I love the calming expressive voice of Aster J. Haile. My heart is constantly touched by the thoughtfulness and subtlety and care with of the yoga nidra meditations on this app.

Also, the 7 minute sleep meditations for children are fantastic. I play two of them for my son, almost every night, for a total of 15 minutes, and every night it helps him relax and go to sleep.

Some of the sleep stories are delightful too. I love the celebration of nature and old sleepy landscapes worldwide that are to be found in the stories. 

There are many amazing resources on this app, and sometimes it can be a little hard to navigate, so if there is one piece of feedback I have, it is to improve the organization on the site, to that an outline display is an option, to make specific meditations easier to find. But that is a tiny concern‚Ä¶.

Aside from that, and most importantly: to anyone needing support and a kind voice to help with sleep, I wholeheartedly recommend this!Edit several years later:
Still use it sporadically! One of only a handful of apps that I can‚Äôt ever justify deleting because while I don‚Äôt use it regularly, the times that I do need it are during a sleep emergency.

Original:
Initially downloaded it when I was trying to find a white noise app to fall asleep to on a plane. Unfortunately I waited until we were boarding the plane before downloading the pile of random apps to test out. I think I had 3 or 4 fully loaded on my phone before we took off- what I didn‚Äôt realize is that most of them were streaming apps and therefore required WiFi/internet/whatever continuously in order to work! Relax Melodies (mostly) does not. I still use it sometimes when I have a hard time falling asleep. Two thumbs up, about to use it again.The new update is fine EXCEPT THE AUTO OFF TIMER!!! I use this app every night to sleep but it‚Äôs so good it‚Äôs hard to wake up so I set it to shut off in the morning before my alarm. But the new update doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äútime off‚Äù choice it just has a timer. So now I have to do a bunch of math every night to see how long I want the app on. Please add the time off feature back!!!!!!!

There are many relaxing high quality sounds to choose from.  I have used the various rain, night, frog and peeper sounds for many years to help myself fall asleep and stay asleep. The sounds can play continuously, uninterrupted all night. You can combine more than one sound. I also enjoy the afternoon and bird sounds during the day and morning when I'm stuck inside but would rather be outside. Love this app and depend on it nearly daily!I've used Relax Melodies for about three years now, especially when my anxiety is amped up. The sounds are soothing and many of them complement other sounds on the app, so you can layer them to great effect. I like that the app plays continuously without timing out, and there's no noticeable looping of the sounds; all this means you can find the sounds that suit you, set your volume, and have the soothing sounds transport you and your concerns elsewhere for as long as you like without the abrupt ""starting over"" gap you hear on noticeably looped sound apps. This app can help you find your zen and get into a better mood. It's always improving, it is stable, and there are often new additions (and your older favorites still remain too!). Thanks, Relax Melodies!First I wanna say how I‚Äôve tried a lot of meditation and relaxing apps. None of which compare. This one sets the record to the all time high for best quality and customization for how you want to meditate. This is my number #1 pick. The different sounds and mixes make for an amazing experience. I really appreciate the time that was put in to making this app, it truly shows. I used this hoping to get better sleep and I got exactly what I wanted. They also have sound waves and different vibrations for anxiety relief and healing. IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Thank you to the creators. I‚Äôm happy to say I will continuously use this app. The price per year is also very reasonable for what you are getting. Totally worth it. Again, thank you.I am so grateful for this app and I can‚Äôt wait to see more people using BetterSleep. I tell everyone I know about it because it feels like a miracle that I am sleeping well again. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I fell asleep at the time I wanted to and slept through the night (I struggle with falling and staying asleep). After using this app I am getting the best sleep of my adult life. THANK YOU!!!! ü•πüôèüèªüò¥ 

I would love to offer user experience feedback though! Is there a way users can easily submit UX feedback?I love to mix the different sounds to create an auditory story that helps me sleep, or meditate, focus, or write. Whatever my need may be. The little meditation programs are nice, and the guided stretching has been really enjoyable. Plus, the interface has really lovely art!

The addition of stories in the new update is wonderful, as well as the new ASMR sounds (though I‚Äôll always be greedy and want more!). The great thing is I feel like the developers seem to read feedback, and take it seriously. It‚Äôs a great app, and the updates continuously improve the experience.I‚Äôve used this app for years and cannot say enough how much I love it! It is absolutely the best to use to help calm the mind and get everyone in the family to sleep. There are various sounds, and new sounds are continuously added! I love the ‚Äúwater‚Äù sounds like rain and the beach, while my mother likes the train sounds best. The meditations and stories are fantastic!! And the music is also amazing! I do not have a single negative thing to say about the app! My family and I absolutely love this app! It‚Äôs the best!I want to express my appreciation for the BetterSleep App team!  They genuinely care about their product and how it helps people!  

They‚Äôve made constant improvements and at the same time listen to the feedback of their users.  They also have a help and support message center within the app that reps respond to in a timely, friendly, and helpful way!  

Recently with one of the updates a feature that was vital to me stopped working.  I reached out and they took my feedback and made it work again!  The best customer service I could ask for!

Is there anything worse than disrupted sleep?! Especially when it happens multiple times nightly?! For an app whose purpose is to help relax and sleep, this one has been failing for the last several months. It turns off for no reason. Just this morning, from 4-5am this morning, it wouldn‚Äôt stay on for more than 20 minutes at a time. And within the last 20 minutes (now 6:08am)) I‚Äôve had to turn it back on 4 times!!!! 
If I knew the premium worked, I would purchase it. But there‚Äôs NO WAY I would spend money on something in which the free version is running so poorly. The last update of just 2 days ago is causing more probs than solving anything. Seems every update is getting worse!
I‚Äôve had this app for 10 years and, alas, it looks like I may have to end my love affair with them. It was a good run! I told everyone about you. My friends. My family. They all fell for you, too. But it looks like we are done.

I would stay up if j had music on, getting distracted by my favorite songs. I would stay up if it was silent, having quiet at night leads to over thinking for me. So I turn this on like thirty minutes before I expect to fall asleep, while I check out social media and within 10-15 minutes, I'm clocked out. We also use it on my ~5 month nephew. So relaxing and peaceful. It gives something for your mind to focus on without the thought provoking nature of lyrical songs.
Update! I still use this every night and for my newest nephew whose only two weeks old! So peaceful.I am a board-certified music therapist and a Psychological Assistant so I work a lot with different types of people, primarily to help with depression, anxiety, and pain. I have used this app to explain the importance of mindfulness practice in wellness seminars and in individual therapy. I have also used it to support live guided visualization a with groups. What I love the most about it is that you can select music from your own playlist and add the sound effects (or downloaded script) over the song. When we have a personal, emotional connection to the music, it enhances the experience tenfold. I suggest this app to all my patients!I love Relax Melodies! I recommend it to everyone- seriously. My favorite thing is that you can choose to use binaural beats to focus, relax or get your brain ready to sleep! Before bed, I only have dim lights in my home for at least an hour before bed, and once I lay down and ban myself from social media until morning (necessary!) I turn this on and just let my day go. Also love the chronic pain meditation - I rarely need it anymore, but using it was vital to start eliminating my pain symptoms.I saw an ad on social media and went to download the app. Low and behold I already have it, but just the light version.

No tracking you! No ads .. no problem! And it works when you need it! Update .. they responded to my concerns and I reinstalled the ap and it is working fine! Four stars for now!
Update .. now it just shuts off after 30 seconds 
Games being playedPuts me right to sleep and helps me to maintain a healthy bedtime routine! UPDATE: it‚Äôs been less than a week of paying the subscription fee and the app started to crash and has continued for 3 days. There is NOT A WAY to store your sleep data so be prepared for your data to disappear as it did for me. The sounds are terrific but the overall sleep tracking system needs work. I cancelled my subscription and will be either choosing a new sleep tracking app or will be going back to Sleep Cycle, where my data is saved and stored for accuracy.",0,godale77sammy-sniper,Years of useBugs and Crashing Constantly,BetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and Sleep,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,231,has_tracking,21

Firstly, and most importantly, the alarm just doesn‚Äôt go off sometimes. 

I know without a doubt how to set up the alarm and use the features within it, and several times in the month since I got this app the alarm just doesn‚Äôt go off at all and I sleep in way too late - again I‚Äôm 100% certain Im using the alarm feature properly and this problem is a deal breaker for me. 

If it doesn‚Äôt get resolved I will not be using this app in the future, as the gentle alarms were by far the most attractive feature that brought me to the app in the first place. 

Second, I think the sounds are great but I don‚Äôt know why you can only use the ‚Äúmixes‚Äù when you start the sleep tracker and you don‚Äôt get access to the full sound library anymore. (Maybe I‚Äôm missing something).

Third, I feel like the sleep metrics are a bit bs‚Ä¶ maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not privy to in the world of sleep science tech - but I don‚Äôt understand how you can really gather all of that ‚Äúdata‚Äù using a microphone alone‚Ä¶
Not to mention I scored a 96 on my sleep this morning, but I did not sleep that well and the alarm failed to go off so I just didn‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù the sleep session on the app for a while after I already had woken up. 

Anyways, like I said, almost a great app. If these problems are fixed then maybe it won‚Äôt feel like I wasted my money.This app does not have auto sleep tracking which makes it useless. It's fun when I remember to set the tracker but that's not going to happen because I fall asleep before I realize I'm asleep and can't start it after. Thought the premium might have it locked away so I started my free trial but NOPE. üëé

Update: okay, to be fair that was fairly harsh. So your apps definitely much better then 1* but I still value automatic tracking. I understand there are requirements but if I'm not offered the option I can't agree to it. And I know there are people who would not agree to it and that's okay.

I have yet to find the ""perfect"" sleep tracker.I really enjoy all the options of sounds you can play. That helps a lot many options to pick from. 
What I don‚Äôt like are the following 
1) app tracking the stages of sleep it‚Äôs very off. I picked a trail run for another very popular sleep app and this one did a much better job with recording the stages. 
2) it doesn‚Äôt record much some days and other days it does. It will also be very off on what the noise it recorded is. 
I wish those were all better but still the price point for a year is far too high I can‚Äôt justify paying that price when the other app which has sounds and better tracking and recording is spot on I don‚Äôt have to correct category at all their price point for a year is very reasonable and fair. So I will be switching. 
But have I enjoyed this app yes I have the choices of sounds is a wide variety but just because of that I can‚Äôt pay any of the options all priced way too high.The ability to mix songs, sounds, and frequencies is the best I have come across! But the sleep tracker is not only worthless, it‚Äôs creepy. It records me breathing, sneezing (which is NoT sneezing, btw) the toilet flushing.   Is this what it‚Äôs using to tell me I‚Äôm in REM, light sleep or deep sleep? I was laying awake for 3 hours and it ‚Äútracked me‚Äù in light and deep sleep! I don‚Äôt like that if you want to make any changes to the sounds you‚Äôre listening to, you must close the whole tracking app. (But I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs 100% erroneous anyway).This review is in hope it reaches the developers. I know many improvements have been made lately. I love this app especially the customization of mixes and the sleep fiction. I will continue to use it but I would like to report a bug I found. When I use one of my mixes with a timer and then start sleep tracking for the night, the app shortly after stops working and I have to leave the app and come back. Sometimes it fixes the issues but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt.I only continue using this app because I accidentally paid for the yearly subscription, I much prefer Rise sleep tracker as I can actually track my sleep and edit my times. This app is not much of a tracker, it‚Äôs extremely simple in those terms. All it lets you do is track on that night, with no option to edit the times or add a previous night if you happened to fall asleep before tracking. It‚Äôs more of an app for stories and things to listen to.",1,Model Citizen 2CaptainRyMMonthewalliwalkgtudhhsjdkdjbdSaltyPancakes03,Bug fixes!!!

And I like being able to track my sleep. I appreciate the recent app update to allow sound tracks to play indefinitely during sleep tracking vs stopping at 3 hours! 
Now the only update needed is to allow for a playlist to play while recording sleep. If I want to merge various sounds and a meditation on a playlist, I cannot then access the sleep recording function. 
Once we enable playlists to play while tracking sleep, the app will be perfect!I‚Äôve had this app for a while now, and it‚Äôs been great. Ever since I‚Äôve started tracking my sleep, I‚Äôve learned some crazy stuff (like my dog snores a lot). 

One thing I wish the app had is a reminder section of the sleep journal so you could set reminders for when you wake up, like for example for me, that I have a test or something similar. 

Anyway, great app! The sounds are very interesting, and I like all the different stories and stuff that helps with sleep troubles. Sweet dreams with this app!Well what can I say!!! There are lots of traps with using this app. I have enjoyed using the white noise for the past 10 years or so. I don‚Äôt need any of the bells and whistles ( pun intended) so it would have been nice to have been left alone without all the unnecessary noise ( pun again intended)
Thank you for reaching out to me. I upgraded your score to a 4 out of 5 (from a 3). I do enjoy your app but please keep the efforts to make me use other elements of your interesting app to a minimum.

It‚Äôs affordable, reasonably priced, easily 1/3rd the cost of other apps that don‚Äôt have half what this app does! You can make your own mixes, and throw in brain wave tones to dream, to not dream. You can throw in white noises or brown noise or green noise. You can save all your mixes with up to 15 layers of sounds, and name each mix. Want to sleep to the sounds of camping on a beach in the Pacific Northwest? Waves, wind through pine trees, campfires and owls, and name it ‚ÄúPNW Beach Camp.‚Äù You can do that! And I‚Äôm just getting started with this app! And let me tell you about the alarm! I have not slept so well and been so happy to wake up. I haven‚Äôt even hit snooze! No need! I‚Äôm so happy waking up to the sounds of mermaids singing to me. I like seeing the sleep tracking reports. Oh and the stories are really good! Performed well. Sounds are great. Like seriously this app is everything and a mermaid song! I‚Äôm so happy with it!Has so many options from brainwaves for sleep AND meditation, white noise (brown/green/pink/etc) for any occasion, relaxing sounds and music not just for adults but also kids and much more. Has guided meditations and several genres of sleep stories to choose from. In addition, it has a sleep tracker that tells you your sleep score, how many hours of light sleep, REM sleep, and deep sleep you are getting and gives you a chart that maps exactly what your nights sleep looked like the night before, with little symbols showing ""events"" with recordings that you can playback and recategorize if their AI miscategorized it. You can also take a quiz that tells you your ideal bed time and wake up time. Finally, you have an option to set an alarm that will wake you up only when you're in a light sleep stage rather than in deep sleep so you're not groggy when waking up! Best feature IMO!I first got this app because I‚Äôd received a sleep mask with Bluetooth speakers and I wanted to use it for helping with sleep while traveling.  It worked great. I could drop off to sleep easily and play my music for a desired time‚Ä¶

I then began to play with additions to the mixes. I found that there were tracks that helped me with focus when I was awake. I began to play those while I was working.  I found stories and guided meditations‚Ä¶ so many options!

I‚Äôve used the sleep tracking function, too and now I have proof that my sleep is improving. On nights when I drop off with Better Sleep, I have more time in deep sleep.  This app has been working great for meVery useful for masking background noise in the city and creating a peaceful environment. I especially appreciate the ability to customize and mix sounds including the volume levels. I have had this app since it was called Relax Melodies, and I‚Äôm glad I was able to buy the lifetime subscription before the app became so complicated and expensive. I‚Äôm not interested in tracking my sleep at night, and after trying some of the stories and meditations, I find the persistent ‚Äúsleep‚Äù theme of everything to be boring. But no complaints‚Ä¶the features that I do use are still far better than any other white noise type app out there.The app asked for a review after the first night of the trial period. So far I can say that I like the fact that sounds can be layered for ultimate results. I also like all the noise choices because music and other recordings just get my mind thinking more than resting. After using the combo of brown noise and deep brown noise I had a 94 sleep score on another health app that I use. That‚Äôs impressive since I‚Äôve been averaging 74 scores. So far so good.I could ask for a better app not only can I put my two little boys to bed or nap, but to be able to help my insomnia and now I‚Äôm starting a new busy job in a office the meditation and focus mixes are great.!!!! Still need to try the stories out and I‚Äôm now using the bedtime goal option and the alarms. And I haven‚Äôt even used the the sleep tracking yet.

Con: 
-In the middle of the night when I awaken and sleep sounds are still going but need to reset meditation/story or choose a different one‚Ä¶Just let me hit the play button and attempt to go back to sleep as seamlessly as possible. Nope! I have to fumble around on my screen to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù I want to leave this meditation/story. Then, enter back in, IF, it will let me. Sometimes, I have to exit out to main menu and go back in all together. Guess what?! Now, I‚Äôm wide awake and the whole darn point of the app is to help me fall asleep.
-The new update has taken away automatically starting you with the last sound mix you made and were listening to‚Ä¶So, I have to fiddle through the new menus and find the mix. Where is the old automatic start. You use to be able to have the player on the bottom as soon as you entered the app. Now I have to fiddle around.
-Entirely, too much going on in the new update. I want to listen to the music and such. Take me there and let me decide I want to go to your newer options. I want to go to sleep, not spend my time trying muddle through the additional stuff to find my sounds.I NEVER write reviews. I have been a long time fan of this app since it‚Äôs very first days. Then they introduced the meditation and sleep frequencies and it was all I needed, all in one place, so I purchased the premium version. I haven‚Äôt used it for a while but came back to realize they monetized it all further and made all the sounds I paid for only available via subscription. How could you just revoke the  privileges I paid for and now charge each month for certain sounds/frequencies instead? I bought it when it was a one time purchase for the audio loops, as it should be. With a background in tech it‚Äôs so easy to see this has purely become a money grab. All it is is audio snippets...that I already paid for! You don‚Äôt see musicians charging per month on individual albums! Don‚Äôt act like a music steaming service and charge per month. It‚Äôs just a shame to see the developers go from sensible people to selfish and senseless scammers. You no longer care about helping people, only about making money. Keep my money, idc. The history of this app proves you represent all that‚Äôs wrong in the world. And for that, it‚Äôs a no from me dawg.Seriously I‚Äôve been listening to the same two free stories bc I genuinely like them. I listened to them a few nights ago and SUDDENLY THE ONLY FREE STORIES ARE LOCKED !?? There was literally only two free ones. $40 is ridiculous to pay for an app. There dozens of locked ones but ya had to lock those two stories available. Real horrible of you. 
Used to be an amazing app until everything become locked. 
Stop locking the only few available things that used to be free for ages. Very very disrespectful to the people who are in a pattern of falling asleep to those same exact sounds every night or so. Which includes me. It‚Äôs not lovely to realize I can‚Äôt use the app anymore like I‚Äôve been using for a long time. What‚Äôs the point of locking those? And no I won‚Äôt do a free week trial because then everything will be locked once again. Not ONE STORY OR MEDITATION IS AVAILABLE FREE. Change it back to how you had it a few days ago. Can‚Äôt advertise a free app but make 3/4 unavailable Unless paying the subscription price. This became such a pointless app.This was my favorite sleep app. I even paid for the upgrade and have been using it for years. However, the recent update has ruined this app. I appreciate the stories aspect and that you are trying to compete with the bigger apps but there are so many bugs now. The timers don‚Äôt work properly and the sound just cut off in the middle of the night so many times that I‚Äôm constantly waking up. I also used to be able to play these sounds with other apps, (asmr and hypnosis apps) that feature is gone now as well. Further more once you click on a story you can come out of that story and edit your timers without cutting the music and the story off completely and ending the ambient sound. I would have never paid for this disorganized app. Please bring back some of the old features and update with bug fixes so we can operate this app like the one previous.It‚Äôs very annoying that the app repeatedly asks to rate the last story, sound, or meditation played. It does it every time I open the app or close out a sound. This makes me want to end my subscription not use it. Fix or remove this function please.

Also, saved playlists are not available across different devices. What‚Äôs the point of the storing the Favorites, but not the playlists we create? I have to spend time recreating playlists on my account on different IOS devices. It‚Äôs annoying& time consuming.

The app just goes silent in the middle of playing any sleep story or meditation after a while. Having to wake up to troubleshoot & force close the app to play again defeats the purpose of having a peaceful sleep through the night while trying to listen to the sounds.This awesome app has been helping me sleep for over a year now. If you are debating getting premium, I highly recommend that you get it. It is more (lots more) of the great content you love. However, I have one complaint, the feature that allows you to play music from your music library is clunky and broken. The interface is bad and it does not allow you to add things to mixes, adjust the volume once your story has started, or play songs from Apple Music, even if they are downloaded. With all the energy you are putting into updating the logo, I hope you will fix this small issue. Otherwise, this application is amazing. I WILL RETURN TO FIVE STARS WHEN THE COMPLAINANT IS ADDRESSED!!! Revision: Thank you for responding, hopefully you can get an updated music player on soon :)I used to love this app, I really did. Worked every time. I knew every story inside out and had used every sound imaginable. I deleted it, and until recently haven‚Äôt used it. But in seek of better sleep I ended up redownloading it, assuming it would be the same it was a year or so ago. I was wrong. 
Every time I open the app, every feature works except for the sounds, which is the feature I use the app for. I pay (and for that matter never stopped billing from this company) every month for this app for it to make no noise. Now there is a solution which is deleting and reinstalling, but I find it highly inconvenient to have to delete the app every single night and reinstall it, considering I‚Äôve payed a pretty hefty amount to this company.
Do better.Sleep therapy for deep calm is the best voice. But now it seems they have only Haley. Her voice and annunciations are not a good fit for me. 
*Bring back the female whose voice is on the above meditation please. When this was relax melodies.

*Would like my choice of sound to stay on whatever I choose when I start the app, I often do more than one and I hate having to set up at the beginning of each meditation I change to. Or at least let me set up each meditation and sound combo and lock it in my favorites.

There are so many possibilities in this app.  I especially love the hypnosis.   I have made many combinations of sounds for the background.  I recently started listening to a new story, I haven‚Äôt listened to the entire story yet as I fall asleep after a few minutes.  Last week I had a musical combination that went through the entire night and lulled me back to sleep when I awoke at 3am.  In the past I would awaken in the middle of the night and toss and turn until daylight.  This night I just took a deep breath, let it out and listened for a minute and I was back to sleep.

I used to really like this app but I need talking to fall asleep so this app doesn‚Äôt work read this review to find out about that. This review talks about goods and( mostly) bads so first is good there is a lot of sounds and you can make your own! Bad so there is like 2 stories that are free and like 4 meditations that are free so if your looking for free meditations then this is not the app for you. Also if you want all of the stuff unlocked then you will need to buy premium for like $60 a year. My parents will not let me buy anything on any app so this is me and my moms suggestion: what if, you did like you could unlock one storie/meditation/sound by itself for like $8-$10 dollars a year to unlock one at least take this in mind And also you guys always are like,‚Äù oh we understand your concern and we will try to fix it üòäüí§üí§‚Äù NO. You always do this! I have requested this for MONTHS and updated it every time! I‚Äôm so fed up with them sending me notifications that,‚Äù oh, a new story came out listen to it nowüòäüí§‚Äù I just turned them off! Every now and then I check in and see if they UNLOCKED any thing but NO! I‚Äôm not using this app anymore! I‚Äôll keep it just so that if they do take care of my request I can rate it but I‚Äôm not using this anymore I‚Äôve found a new app. Thanks for reading this. Just take in mind that if you don‚Äôt want to pay... find a new app.I downloaded this app after seeing an ad for ‚Äúgreen noise‚Äù on instagram. I use a white noise app every single night and have for the past 6 years or so. It‚Äôs free. It has always been free and will most likely always be free. No account, no emails, no marketing, nothing. Anyway, what bothered me with this app is I rejected paying for the it after it offered the 7 day trail. When I did that, it showed me a different, lower yearly price (with no context other than it was 30% off) so I clicked on it thinking it wouldn‚Äôt charge me, because of said 7 day trial. Well, it did charge me lol. So I have a refund request with apple. My real gripe is that I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay without even LOOKING at any of the apps features first, and a trial should be accessible without making a legitimate subscription. Also I poked around on the app for 5 minutes and YES it seems like it has a lot of features, but I don‚Äôt want or need any of them. So long story short, shame on me, I‚Äôm an idiot, but just be careful putting your info on the app or else you‚Äôll get hit with a YEARLY subscription fee right off the bat. Sorry to the developers but that was super shady.Been using this app for a decade now. One of the latest updates is really driving me up the wall. Where I used to be able to just boot up the app and get to my stories every night, I now boot it up and need to rate the last thing, give it a feeling, exit the recommendations (which don‚Äôt include my usuals), click on the moon, then on stories, then scroll to find the story I want. PLEASE put me out of my misery.

On another note, there needs to be an option in-app to un-download sounds. A few times now I‚Äôve deleted a story or meditation (accidentally, to save space, because I didn‚Äôt like the story, on a phone restore‚Ä¶) and it then will not play on the app at all, nor will it redownload. The only solution I‚Äôve found is to delete the app altogether, then download it again.Was excited to try this app since I‚Äôve been dealing with insomnia for the last few weeks and I was looking to try something new. 

First, there aren‚Äôt any free meditations to listen to. I was hoping to have at least a handful to choose from for a free version, since many meditation apps offer at least that.

Second, there was one free story to listen to. Great, it started off with a lady speaking in a soothing voice about being in a spacecraft and flying around space. Seemed pretty promising to help me relax and fall asleep. But, a few minutes in, a harsh robotic voice repeats ‚Äúdoing head scan‚Äù, along with other body part scans over and over again. Sounded like nails on a chalkboard, ugh. Had to laugh to myself because I was drifting to sleep from the story, then was rudely awoken by the robot shortly after.. in the same story. 

Besides not really living up to my expectations overall, there are some nice free sounds you can choose from to make your own mix for white noise basically.Previously I had four stories unlocked, since I don‚Äôt have the subscription. Am really frustrated that the story about the highland giants is now locked, the only one I use. The only one still unlocked is the one I don‚Äôt like the most, which just adds to the annoyance. Worst part I could find one other free story, so I went from four options to two. I left my previous sleep app because of all my favorite stories being locked behind a subscription without a heads up, or a say in at least keeping one story. I love the app. I just hate the sudden changesHow do I start this,, I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I tough I‚Äôll give it a go for this one. This app definitely does not help me sleep, instead it keeps me awake, maybe it‚Äôs not for me, long story short I‚Äôm a truck driver and I have a hard time getting some quality sleep so I said I‚Äôm gonna give this app a try, I saw commercials on tv that it will help you get to sleep in 6 minutes with the green noise, well that doesn‚Äôt work on me, I tried different kinds of sound to, no difference,, maybe it‚Äôs meant for people who like some kind of noise in the background but not for me",2,üòòüòòüòò12üòòüòòüòòGroans loudlyBlakellipsispiperr731Mcpe203samy^,"Pls look!I‚Äôm sure this app is great, BUTSo many new, unnecessary clicks!Had Higher HopesGreat, but my stories are now lockedAbout the app",BetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and SleepBetterSleep Relax and Sleep,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1070,has_narrative,70

All of the features are fantastic, and I‚Äôve easily gotten my money‚Äôs worth since I started using it. However, there are some features which I think need more work.

For example (and this is the biggest one): I wish that there was a way for me to use the sleep tracker feature while also listening to my playlists that I‚Äôve created. I listen to the same playlist of stories every night, but when I try to use the sleep tracker, I only have access to a small number of story/ASMR options. It would be great if the sleep tracker was a bit more flexible. You also can‚Äôt use Bluetooth headphones in the sleep tracker, which is unfortunate too.I really like this app, it has a very rich set of sounds that can be mixed together to make very soothing combinations that can then be added as ‚Äúsoundtracks‚Äù to narrated stories. Most nights, I fall asleep before the end of the story. The only thing I would like to see changed ( for a 5* rating ) is the user interface. It is sometimes confusing, particularly when you think you have something all set up, ready to go, only to find the app resets to its Home Screen when you are ready to play a story or meditation. Also, a ‚Äú Recently Played‚Äù list would be helpful.I've had trouble sleeping for many years.  I've gotten to the point where I need some kind of podcast (not music) to help me sleep.  Then I wake up several times during the night and it's the same story.  But I have wondered if maybe that's been too stimulating for my brain (ya think?).  So I was curious to see if these soothing sounds would help.  It's only been a few nights but so far my sleep has improved and that's something for me.  I combine ""night"" (crickets) with ""birds"" and it's very subtle.  I hope this really is a long term improvement, what a blessing that would be!We do enjoy this app! It's a nice one with still enough features under the free version to decide if you want to buy. We keep using the free version for now as it does help me sleep and really helps my fianc√© too.

   I just wanted to say that the app is absolutely amazing but there is just one thing I would like to comment on. I‚Äôm only about ten years old and a lot of things like meditations and stories are locked because my parents will not let me spend money on stuff like this and I feel like this might be an issue for other people that are younger like in the age range of six through eleven. I have heard all the unlocked stories like spaceship 28, and The underwater city. I also heard all the meditations like, Dropping into the present moment. I would really like to hear something new for a change. Like if a teacher was to read a book and then read it again and again every day for the ten months your in school it probably wouldn‚Äôt be fun. Just like how listening to the same things over and over again can get boring and even annoying. It‚Äôs a very good app I‚Äôve been using it for two or more years now and it‚Äôs prevented so much stress. But I just need a new story that  I can listen to. All I‚Äôm saying is that the people who don‚Äôt have the things unlocked should have a bit more songs10/21 - Developer released patch and couple days ago,  and it fixed the issue. Very happy to be able to use this app again. I swear at this point it‚Äôs a Pavlovian response. I turn on one of the stories in this app and I‚Äôm asleep within 10 minutes. Try ‚Äú2am at the blueberry hill diner‚Äù. Very soothing story. Will put you to sleep in minutes. 

I pay for the yearly subscription because I find the stories help my fall asleep when the white noise sounds don‚Äôt work. But now suddenly it won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve gotten into a routine finally that as soon as I get into bed. I turn on this app and play this dumb sorting game and I‚Äôm out in like 5 minutes. As someone with chronic insomnia so bad it affects my ability of do my job, this app was the only thing that helped. As soon as I open the app it crashes and I didn‚Äôt even do the update. Extremely disappointed it won‚Äôt work.Update:
The developer reached out and they‚Äôve corrected the bug. Happy to give 5 stars now! Please hire Aster J. Haley for more hypnosis content ‚Äî I LOVE her voice!!

Original review:
I love this app and pay for the premium subscription but it‚Äôs SO BUGGY! I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled it several times and made sure my iPhone is updated, but the issues persist. I‚Äôll set the sleep tracker and use one of the options displayed and at first everything is fine, but then the same track will loop over itself creating this echo of whatever story I‚Äôm tryin for listen to. If this didn‚Äôt happen every night with me having to force close the app and restart several times I‚Äôd give 5 stars.My seven-year-old daughter does not like to get off of her iPad and go to bed on time ever. I‚Äôm saying never. Ever! However, I discovered this app, put on a sleeptale about a pegasus or fairy wardrobe or a mermaid for her, and she is out in under five minutes! Every. Single. Time! I could not do that if I was reading her a bedtime story, making her lie there in the dark, nothing I did would ever get her to go to sleep like this app has. If you have children that fight bedtime, try this app out! Plus, if not for this app, her doctor would‚Äôve never known that she needed to have a tonsillectomy. So it has helped us in more ways than 1.  Thank You Better Sleep! üíôüåùIt's a really good app with lots of sounds and meditations but I think a lot of the loops are really short . One of my favorite features is the timed shut off !!! It‚Äôs a really good app but they don‚Äôt update a lot so your stuck with the same meditation and story‚Äôs but all in all it‚Äôs really good app and the sounds are amazing.

I still felt her blood on me, heard her panicked voice.....I never thought I'd sleep again. Then.....I discovered better sleep. It did what other apps don't. It turned my phone into my friend. Helped me relax through all kinds of meditations, bedtime stories and more. I began to find joy in turning on my phone, putting on a story and listening to the narrator as I fall asleep. It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this app. In a good way. Better sleep is like a friend. A life long dear friend.....no....it's more like.....it's a compassionate experience like what you get when you're a child held by your mother. The voice overs are so gentle and inviting while the background music is so magical and mood inspiring. The stories are something you can't help but embrace. The meditations are guided by the narrator as if it's a teacher in your room. Better sleep is my hero. Wonder if this could have saved mom if I had known abiut better sleep back then. Thank you better sleep for giving me a future to look forward to. I was starting to think I would live the rest of my life fearful of sleep. Now I live my life normal again with a healthy view of sleeping, wrapped in the arms of my friend, better sleep.I love this app!! It‚Äôs kind of like an escape from that state where you‚Äôre waiting to go to sleep- and thoughts and problems may keep you awake-this occupied your mind peacefully until sleep just kind of creeps up on you. I‚Äôve always had trouble sleeping and dreaded lying awake at night. Now I look forward to a peaceful transition. Thanks Relax Melodies!!

I‚Äôve now had the app for a couple of months. In addicted!! I‚Äôve had trouble sleeping all of my life. As soon as I start to get tired, instead of lying for hours in the dark, I put on a story‚Äîa new one or one of my very favorites‚Äîand sometimes before I‚Äôve even listened for five minutes, I‚Äôm already out!  I cannot believe it.

Also, great meditation guides. I am not one to sit still long enough for any type of ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù. But at times when I am so stressed, and I can‚Äôt relax, I‚Äôve gone to my room, turned out the lights and listened to a meditation. It has put me in a completely relaxed state and brought down my blood pressure and heart rate. Wow! I coughed up the bucks for the full version, which goes on sale fairly often, and it is well worth it. Anyway, a glowing report all around.I‚Äôve been using this app for so many years now‚Ä¶it just keeps getting better and better.  It‚Äôs so much fun to create sound mixes and there is an amazing selection of quality sounds.  Not only can you mix different sounds together but you can have them oscillate in and out which gives a much more realistic effect.  You can also add music into the sounds which adds yet another dimension.  There are stories and meditations and exercises and advice to check out.  I love the stories best of all.  The voices are soothing and there are a great variety of stories to choose from - something for everyone I would guess.  I love falling asleep to someone reading a bedtime story for me.  üòÇ  I won‚Äôt lie, there are other apps out there and I think I‚Äôve tried them all.  Some are very good but I truly think this one is best.  Here‚Äôs what I love to do: create a playlist.  I‚Äôll start with a meditation then move to a story or two and then end with a sound mix - something like ocean waves.  It takes me through most of the night.  Fabulous!üëèI‚Äôve had a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep for a while. I tried this app a few months ago and it worked magic LOL. It worked so good I had to get the Premium version and it was the best decision ever. I find that the stories and meditations help me fall asleep faster. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm focused on the stories/meditations so I‚Äôm not laying in my bed worrying about other stuff. Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I can‚Äôt fall back asleep, so I just put on another story/meditation to go back to sleep. Another thing I really like is the Sounds/Music. I love that there are dozens of sounds I can choose from, and that I can add different sounds and make them louder or softer depending on what I like. ( and I can save my mixes so I can listen to them again). Overall, I absolutely love this app and recommend it to anyone who has a hard time falling/staying asleep.I look forward to using this app as I fall asleep. I have one of those Bluetooth sleep masks with headphones in it, and this app paired with that is fantastic. Before I started using this app, it would take me as long as an hour or more to fall asleep. Now, I select a story to listen to, pop on my sleep mask, and within minutes, my mind stops racing, I feel so relaxed, and I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve been falling asleep within 15-20 mins now. I‚Äôm so grateful. The year subscription cost is totally worth it. My only two cons: 1.) I wish they added new stories regularly ‚Äî like at least weekly ‚Äîbecause at the rate I‚Äôm going, I‚Äôve basically already listened to most of the ones with voice artists I like. 2.) I‚Äôm not really a fan of Aster Haile‚Äôs voice, and she voices a lot of the stories, so that limits my options even more.I‚Äôve been using this app for years and it has been a godsend. There are tons of options to choose from and I greatly enjoy the newer story feature. My only issue is that I paid for a lifetime subscription a few years ago but they have removed my access. And when I try to hit the help and support option, nothing happens. Very odd and I hope the help button gets fixed soon so I can get back to my favorite sounds.

Edit: I got a quick response from the developer! And although the help and support button in-app still isn‚Äôt working for me, I was able to figure out the issue! I changed my email a while back but the lifetime subscription needed my old email. So it was a super easy fix. 

Either way, highly recommend a subscription if you can afford it. You get so many more options!I believe I have been a subscriber of this app toward the beginning of its release. I have found it incredibly helpful in my nightly battle with insomnia that I became a lifetime subscriber. I use all elements of the app. I find the bedtime stories narrated by gifted storytellers with soothing voices particularly effective, allowing me to unwind, relax and drift off to sleep. The guided meditations have been invaluable, supporting me during anxious periods experienced over the last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I get excited when there is a new story or meditation which keeps my interest and experience with Relax Melodies fresh, never boring.

I also wish to recognize and express my thanks for impressive customer service  from the customer support and developers who all worked with me to resolve a frustrating bug that unexpectedly and abruptly shut off the app on my iPad. 

I can honestly say that Relax Melodies has been a game changer for me, supporting a good night sleep without the need of medication. To the entire team with a special shout out to Maroussia, Jessika with customer support, and mindfulness meditation leaders and narrators Aster, Tori, Dave, Octavius, Drew,  Bryan, Sarah, Leonard, Joshua - you are all amazing and I offer my deepest gratitude for the gifts of sleep, relaxation and sanity. ‚ù§Ô∏èThrough the years, this app has evolved into a stellar relaxation tool. I especially like the recent addition of a filter for Bedtime Stories, which enables you to search for a story by name of narrator, genre, length, and much more! There is also a similar filter for Meditations.  You an set bedtime goals, listen to any one of a huge selection of sounds, or create your own mix.  The choices of sounds, meditations, music, etc. continue to expand, and my favorite, the Bedtime Stories, can put me right to sleep. 

Finally, the customer service is always exemplary - they are quick to respond and offer great support any time an issue arises - and they are all so nice!  

There is something in this app for everyone.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!On my business trips I suffer from regular stress-induced insomnia. What a joy to find something that helps clear my mind and deliver me to sleep! It took a while to find a set of sounds and meditations that work for me, but it‚Äôs worth the exploration (even though it meant a few more sleepless nights while I found the right combo). I wish you could sort sounds based on intensity level instead of just by type, and that you could more easily modify a mix once it has started. I also wish you could slow down the voices of meditation/story readers (like you can on podcasts).  I love the narrators they‚Äôve found, but slowing the voices would lead to more tranquil storytelling. Other than that I give it top ratings.I‚Äôve tried many apps that claim they will help with your sleep, however none of them really do the job. If they do, it takes a lot of time. 
However, i came upon this app and i must say it is the best thing ever. I love everything the app provides for a better nights rest and trust me i‚Äôve seen improvement. 
The meditation guides are amazing and super relaxing. As with the bedtime stories! Yes, bedtime stories. You may wonder why the heck would you listen to a bedtime story as an adult, but actually they‚Äôre really nice and they have all types of genres. I recommend this app completely. I‚Äôve already paid yearly because I think it does charms.
Try it out for free at first and see if you like it and maybe you‚Äôll have the same response!The ability to make your own customizable sounds and music together?!?! So amazing! I love everything about this program, the sounds are so pleasant and perfect for whatever you‚Äôre doing! Studying? Meditating? Yoga? Sleeping? They‚Äôve got everything for everyone.

They also have guided meditation sessions and story times for whatever you need. Need a break from reality? Need something to bring you back into your body? Need a calming exercise? Or even sessions to help you get better sleep (duh)!

The staff as well have been so helpful and kind! It‚Äôs been an absolute pleasure to work with them for any of my problems, they‚Äôre so  understanding and come to the table with an open mind and heart. Over all I would give 10 stars if I could!If you just want to relax, this app is awesome to listen to a calming voice telling a story. If you‚Äôre not in a mood for a story listen to soothing music, or listen to the music as you fall asleep, as I do every night. Add your own sounds to the music from the large assortment (I love the nature sounds, right now I am playing singing birds softly in the background with my music). Start the sleep timer when you get in bed, and the alarm will wake you when your time is up, and give you a report on your sleep, along with a list of sounds it picked up while you were asleep.

All in all, I would recommend this app to anyone who has sleep issues, as well as anxiety!I have enjoyed making sound mixes on ‚Äúbetter sleep‚Äù. I have found them to be relaxing and the sleep timer function is great!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Update: I became a subscriber.  Having access to the sleep stories, mediations and hypnosis tracks has been a great help in slowing down my busy mind and allowing me to drift to sleep at night.  For me, it is helpful to distract all of those mental monkeys with soothing sounds and calming breaths, etc.  

Unlike listening to an audio book at bedtime, like I used to, there is no anxiety over missing parts of the story or losing your place.  I find I feel more rested the next morning when I use the app to assist my sleep routine. Grateful to have this app!This is the best sleep app. The subscription is absolutely worth it. The sounds, stories, meditations, dozer sounds, the staff is quick to respond to any inquiry on the app. I use this every single night and during my mid day naps at work. One hope I would have is something more ‚Äúpower nap‚Äù oriented. All stories pretty much start with sleeping in a nice warm bed where as I‚Äôm sleeping in my car during my naps lol. Literally not a big deal at all. I always smile to myself as I tilt my driver side seat back when the story says relax and prepare for a goodnight sleep. Like, it‚Äôs 12:00 pm on a Tuesday and I‚Äôm in a parking garage. Love this app! Thank you ‚Äústaff‚Äù for doing all you do! Send me some merch so I can rep you guys.Better Sleep is the best sleep sound mixer, sleepytime storyteller, relaxation app, and sleep analyzer. I looked for something like this for years especially when my children were infants and then when I struggled to sleep due to racing thoughts. I found this and have never slept better due to my own customized sounds that play. I can even use the sound mixer during the day for relaxing. I love a good rainstorm for sleeping and nature sounds for waking. Also, the sleep analyzer helped me learn about my sleep patterns. If you‚Äôre into sleep stories or meditation, the app offers this as well. Give it a try like I have for better, restful sleep!I‚Äôve used this app for years and I really like the nature sounds. I could do without the meditation and story time stuff but that‚Äôs just my personal opinion. 

The thing Id like to see is more sounds that provide a serious / eerie mood. Imagine the inside of a spaceship and you‚Äôre not quite sure if it‚Äôs safe. Or maybe you are sad and you just want to wallow in it.  The current options for music / ambient melody are all so fluffy and sweet. Not everyone wants to float on a cloud of cotton candy all the time. Sometimes I‚Äôd like to go to sleep with a soundtrack to fuel my scary and adventurous dreams.   Think about it. I know you can do it! 

ThanksI‚Äôve used this app for over a year now and look forward to the new music and stories. I really like listening to the stories, but I often read in bed, so on those nights I just put on the music with some of my favorite sounds. Other nights I just want to crash and listen to a story. I usually use the timer, so if it does take me awhile to fall asleep the music or story continues and I don‚Äôt have to worry about restarting the app. I‚Äôve just sent a trail to my oldest daughter, so that my granddaughter can listen. She sometimes has trouble getting settled and falling asleep. She‚Äôs ten. Keep up the good work you‚Äôre doing with this app!I‚Äôve always had issues sleeping, but this really gets it right. All of it. The soundscape creator is a great idea, the tones are genuinely helpful night-to-night, the music is good, the narrators do fantastic work (pay them more!) on all of their reads for any genre. The art style is lovely and flows together while being categorically distinct yet still flowing together (pay them more!). 

Seriously, it‚Äôs a game changer. I got headband headphones to sleep on my side. Between those and a sound bath, a custom mix, or a little narrated story about some dude in candy town, I am right off to sleep. If you‚Äôre doubtful, try it. Get it, enjoy it, goodnight!This app is amazing for sleep. I tried the first night and I was in love with this app. I really like how you can pick multiple sounds at once. This is amazing for sleep. This is truly a five star app. I have a sleeping issue were I need to take medicine to fall asleep and it really helps. This might sound weird but if it‚Äôs quiet when I sleep I here footsteps and breathing so it really helps clear the dead silence. If you are like me a truly recommend this app. I heard of a similar app before called Calm most of it‚Äôs not free, it‚Äôs weird where they have story‚Äôs when you sleep, and unlike this app you can‚Äôt combine sounds. I have stress issues so this really helps. If you want a sleeping app this is the one!Ok, so I‚Äôm young and have trouble getting to sleep ü•±I was searching around for better sleep apps before I got BetterSleep, the ones I had didn‚Äôt help much and I saw BetterSleep with high ratingsüíØ so I tried it out and I didn‚Äôt regret it. l LOVE‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app! I love the creativity in the stories and meditations. and they are specifically made for sleep üí§  other apps just made story‚Äôs that would entertain me instead of them being relaxing and calm, 
And they help me get to sleep but I have one suggestion it is not negative I just want to ask to add new stories and meditations more often. Thanks!                                                       

P.S add more sounds.I‚Äôve been battling insomnia for years and I‚Äôve tried everything to cure it. This app perfectly curates what you like and helps you to fall asleep easier. I have never been a big fan of meditation so I was always super hesitant to try this app. This app makes me feel as though someone is sitting next to my bed reading me a story. I will admit I was not too happy about the price tag at first but the kind of sleep I get with this app is priceless. My favorite feature has to be the noise recording. I love waking up and hearing all the crazy noises and things I say and do during my sleep. 
10/10 sleep 
8/10 priceI think it‚Äôs a great app it‚Äôs help me sleep and the noises are so natural but I do have one flock it‚Äôs not that big you should probably just lower down how much stuff you got to be a member for maybe like three or four things you see there‚Äôs a really good story I want to hear but I have to be a member and I can‚Äôt afford that kind of money but this is a great app and I think you should update it and it‚Äôs very very good and you say I‚Äôm only 11 and when I‚Äôm sleeping and listening to this I feel Dead asleep and it makes me go to sleep very fast>333üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüíï‚ôæMy sleep has been so much better since I downloaded this app. I use it every single night. I have my favorite readers and keep my favorite stories on playlists so that even if I wake up, a story is always playing softly and I can drop back into sleep right away.

You can add sound mixes to the background of the stories so you can feel like you‚Äôre being read to on a rainy night with a fire going in the fireplace‚Äîor play meditations, spa music‚Äîanything you need to personalize your sleep experience. I love this app.I love this app. It has everything from meditation, to creating your own sounds  and music for your personal needs. It also offers sound waves for relaxation, sleep, healing and more.  I love that there are stories and meditations offered for kiddos. With this pandemic, my 6 year old has trouble calming down and falling asleep. It now has become our nighttime ritual to lay in bed together and listen to a story or try and body scan. I never buy the entire package offered by an app, but I‚Äôll continue to pay annually for this one. I‚Äôm sold!!I love to mix the different sounds to create an auditory story that helps me sleep, or meditate, focus, or write. Whatever my need may be. The little meditation programs are nice, and the guided stretching has been really enjoyable. Plus, the interface has really lovely art!

The addition of stories in the new update is wonderful, as well as the new ASMR sounds (though I‚Äôll always be greedy and want more!). The great thing is I feel like the developers seem to read feedback, and take it seriously. It‚Äôs a great app, and the updates continuously improve the experience.This is such a great sleep app. It lets you create your own sound mix AND control the volume on each element of the mix. They also have ready made mixes and even those you can control each element to your liking. They are many other features like storytelling, wavelengths, and relaxation techniques that you get in this app that makes it such a great sleep companion. I use it nightly with myself and my kids. It comes us right down and allows us to fall into a deep slumber. Totally recommend. Give it a try, I think you‚Äôd love it too!I have so many things to say about Relax Melodies! First of all, you‚Äôre able to choose from so many sounds and make a mix, change up the volume of each sound in the mix, make multiple mixes and organize them based on favorites or not. There‚Äôs also a meditation and story which is incredibly calming, my sister listens to it a lot. There‚Äôs a premium option, of course, but non-paying, you still have so many things to choose from!! I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you, it lives up to its name and is the best sleep app that I have. Sleep well!I just started using this App and the very first thing I noticed is beautiful, high quality of all of the sounds whether it is music, white noise, narratives, etc. The crystal clear audio is truly amazing. As for sleep, I have only used it one night so I can‚Äôt report on that yet but so far, I am impressed with how much content that this App has. I have only scratched the surface on the variety of things there is to listen to, from stories to meditations to lovely music and more! Way more than a white noise App.I have to say that I am so grateful that this app was created.  This app has several binaural beats (although personally, I only use the deep sleep one), and along with some music in the background (specific to induce sleep, for my choice), I can then add a story to listen to.  And, I can even take the binaural beats and music background and even listen to a story in another app...amazing!  I haven‚Äôt found any other apps that can do that while having their own stories.  
I love just how customizable this app is.  
Perfect.
Thank you, developers.This app is awesome, I have been using it for maybe a year now and I love it. I have noticed so much change in how fast I am able to fall asleep because before I would fined my self laying in my bed trying so hard to fall asleep but this app helped that! Ofc I had to buy the full app thing to get all of the mediations and story‚Äôs but it is soooo worth it! Definitely recommend this app hands down if you are having a hard time falling asleep or even having trouble with in anxiety or self love.Ok first off I wanna talk about why everyone in the reviews is writing like a whole essay about this app. Second when I don‚Äôt feel like falling asleep to music or can‚Äôt fall asleep to it I use this app and I swear it controls my mind cause when I use the app I have amazing dreams that could literally be in a Wattpad story about the things and fandoms I am intrested in. So yea this app is cool. You do have to pay for some things in this app but I don‚Äôt and it still gives a good experience üëçI have had BetterSleep since 2017. I bought a Lifetime subscription then. I love all the additions they have added over the years. Recently, I was having trouble logging in and seemed to lose my subscription. The help desk responded promptly, walked me through finding my purchase history and worked with me to restore my Lifetime Subscription. I highly recommend the app both for all the restful features and excellent customer service.This app has been essential for me to sleep for the past 6 years now. I broke my ankle in 2017 and was bed ridden for months. My sleep schedule got really wonky after a few weeks. Eventually I learned to turn off my thoughts and turn on my sleep sounds for relief. Love the sounds but I really love the stories. The stories really help me quiet my mind and visualize what I am listening to so I drift off into sleep. I hardly ever hear the end of a story or meditation.This app has improved my life tenfold. It really helps me sleep and I have suffered insomnia and nightmares for my whole life. I love how customizable it is. Request: please add some rainy day and cottage/off grid living stories or meditations! There aren‚Äôt a lot of stories that go well with rain sounds and my current escape fantasy and life goal is to live off the land in a little house in the forest so a story like that would be so soothing :) thank you for this app, I love it so much.I have been using Calm for a while but I wasn‚Äôt about to pay for it just to hear a sleep story. BetterSleep has more stories that I can listen to and more sounds that I can fall asleep to and just more options in general than any other apps I‚Äôve tried, and for free. There are some things that you have to pay for which I am not doing yet, but this is definitely the best sleeping app I‚Äôve tried.I started using this app for myself, since I start thinking about the next days tasks as I crawl into bed. I used to try soothing music, it was sort of effective after 15 or 20 minutes. With this app I have enjoyed the voices telling a story the most. There are sounds of nature too, I have tried both. Since it worked well for me I started using it when I babysit. Which really helps promoting longer naps. I like it so far!I love this app. I sleep better and wake up feeling alert and happy. The hypnosis is my favorite and Aster is my favorite narrator. The emotional release from some of these meditations are incredible, it relieves so much sadness. 

I do hope in a future update they‚Äôll include the ability to have a mix automatically start after a story, without making a playlist. I love listening to the stories, but I want the sound mixes afterwards to help me stay asleep.This app is brilliant. Not only is going to sleep now the most interesting thing in my day, but I am able to successfully block out my horrible neighbor‚Äôs loud television with the most fun white noise mixes on the planet. Today I have dramatic music topped with shushing baby, elvish whispers, owls, whales, gulls and forest sounds. Can‚Äôt stop smiling. Would love an option to make long story mixes and hope new stories keep coming. Really the best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded.My son is three years old and has extra needs. Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to put him to sleep. We live next to a Pentecostal church which helps keeps children and youth off the streets. However, they sometimes stay out late on a school night. To make the long story short, the noise level is often excessive. I‚Äôve had this app since before my son was born and decided I‚Äôd try it on him. IT WORKED!!!! We can drown out the noise enough to get my son back to sleep. Thank you.You know I love the calm music in this app and it‚Äôs really helped me fall asleep. As a student in school I get very stressed about things, But this app helps me feel more at ease. I recommend downloading this app especially because of the little storytelling to help you fall asleep. It‚Äôll make you feel so sleepy!!! As long as you keep using this app, You‚Äôll fall asleep faster and have an amazing time throughout the day. Thanks BetterSleep! <3I hadn't used it in a while, but I am so glad that I revisited it because the sleep time stories have been so helpful (I particularly love the Story of Tea ü´ñ). I am a distance runner and long miles really make it hard for me to unwind and get restorative sleep - the Better Sleep sleep stories are so helpful to the process of winding down my brain and body to get as good quality sleep as possible.I have really been enjoying the Better Sleep app. Other sleep apps weren‚Äôt working for me because every night I didn‚Äôt need the same type of relaxation. Better sleep is all encompassing insofar as choices for whatever you may need - a story, meditation, sounds, even a full body relax to prepare for sleep. This is a one stop app for all your needs.I liked the free version so much I paid for a year subscription, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the purchase. My favorite parts of this app are probably the meditations and the stories, my mind races at night, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about negative or stressful things in my life. The meditations and stories distract me from my own thoughts and I‚Äôm almost always asleep before a single meditation or story ends.",3,starfox galaxySkydog007friendly shopperKirra7777La412pghNezomiLucindavanLinbmcdHarlanhaugheyZeeKagBri Cassincountry grannieEfsbastitches101I don't creativyEzziemasdonuts 50Cbrame1031keiradonutpup loverüê∂anne.marie.99frike Yeah youngFifth stringAmanstein29Voreadusmybabies84redhaired-insomniacReview4U2ConsiderPmyp4711BTMia_MaganaManatee333Super awesome xxxxBig Al 4 TrumpGwizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzznathib77Ktmomo77kurtngoldieAutism_Momma79231oooNikwTigerLawyercsonmcwjenniferd33,"This app saved my lifeRelax MelodiesSimply the BestLOVEChanged my nights for the better.Long-time userAntidote for My InsomniaI continue to highly recommend this app!Finally, some rest!Seriously Helps!AMAZING APPGreat sleep app!Very helpful!Best everBetter Sleep induces serious zzz‚ÄôsGreat app - but missing somethingI love this app.Genuinely helpful tool for sleepAMAZINGLove it!!!!!Cured my insomniaAwesome but here‚Äôs what I thinkAptly named.

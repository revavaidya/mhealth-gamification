This app has gotten progressively less reliable. Currently it just hangs at the start menu and the watch has to be powered down and restarted to regain control and start a run. It showed a random selection of recent runs in the history on the watch, like one from Sunday and one from Thursday, but Tuesday is missing. This application is not worth the time to download.
I saw a Nike reply to another review that pointed out how badly their app performs and there reply was the app is as fresh as a new pair of kicks, which doesn‚Äôt say much for their shoes. How hard is it to do what the other running apps seem to do without issue, track runs, start reliably, synchronized with other devices, not lose runs when you finish the run?? Their ‚Äúgreat‚Äù social aspects of their app are a joke, the entire top third of leaderboards appear to be falsified runs at least they have limited the fake runs to 50 km per day...I was a huge fan and proponent of Nike Run Club. I got over the fact that they took away friend leaderboards a few years ago but then bought it back.  I trained for my second marathon using the Nike marathon plan in 2019 and significantly crushed my goal as I did all but one run in the plan. Now I‚Äôm training for my third and wanted to use Nike Run Club and here I am in week two ready to trash this plan, the app, and move on to something else like garmin or under armour.

It‚Äôs ridiculous I have to start my training plan IN the app for it to count. In the past I could use my Apple Watch (Nike version) or garmin watch and runs would upload and I could apply the runs to the plan. That feature is gone! For speed work I had to hold my phone in my hand‚Ä¶that‚Äôs no fun and pretty annoying. 

This may be good for other shorter training plans but for a marathon I think this is counterproductive. By the end of week 2 training, I‚Äôm going to reconsider other plans and drop Nikes.I am ticked my running friends use this app to track our runs. The guided runs are good, but every time over the last 2 years i‚Äôve used the coaches runs it disappoints. Literally click start from the run scheduled for the day, complete it and it doesn‚Äôt record the run. it shows in my history, but doesn‚Äôt associat with my plan. When I had my iPhone 6+ thought it was because I had an old phone, the same on my 10. Yes, you can edit a run to add it to your plan but then that run won‚Äôt show on any leaderboards or challenges, because the edit feature allows you to change times and distances too. I use the app to stay connected with distant friends and want ALL my runs to show up. I wish my cheap friends would let us use a paid app that actually works and is supported.I have over 5000 miles logged with Nike+ and Nike Run Club over maybe 1000 runs.  The good: it tracks distance, time, your splits.  With Apple Watch or other supported device you can track heart rate.  The bad: so many great past features have been dropped to make this a pretty bare bones running app.  It‚Äôs hard to see how many miles you‚Äôve run in a month or a year.  You can no longer see where you‚Äôve run except by opening each and every individual run.  Gone are the leaderboards with your friends or the integration with other social networks.  Challenges used to be really good but now they stink.  Completely dropped web support.  NRC is a shadow of what Nike+ used to be.  Over the years I‚Äôve gotten 50 or 100 to try Nike+ and honestly in good conscious I cannot recommend this app.There is someone on the leaderboard who has apparently ran 899 miles for the month of December. I am writing this review on the fifth....

This has been an ongoing complaint and I figured that Nike would have found a solution by now however, it is still happening. So I am finally writing a review in hopes that some changes will be made. 

I also just finished reading some reviews that stated that Nike removed the coaching feature. Luckily I am in the middle of a training plan so this is not affecting me at the moment. I have been using the app since 2014 and I really enjoy it so I hope that the removal of this feature does not force me to look at new apps for running.",0,"Unreliable app on the Apple WatchThis app used to be the best, now it‚Äôs üóëBuggy app never fixed Coaching features don‚Äôt track runsNot the worst running appSame problems for ages",David FlyerCwalke35jvsquaredBhamStank.platter,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,5,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,818,has_leaderboard,31

From the running plans (which they updated and the new plans are never the right fit) to the competitive aspect where you can see a leaderboard of all your friends. I love new cheering feature where your friends can cheer you on during your run and vice versa. But I‚Äôve been using the app since watch series 1 (I‚Äôm now on the series 3) and it‚Äôs never been a good experience. It freezes, crashes, I end my runs to soon from tapping when I thought it was frozen. Worst of all I just discovered even when I thought it was working, it wasn‚Äôt syncing my runs. I had 17 runs in October, Nike app says 14. I had 8 runs in November so far and Nike says 2. But I know because the activity app says I ran with Nike run. The other day after a run with my brother I told him about my issues and he said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just use a different app?I've been using Nike run so long that the thought never occurred to me. Well today is the today. If they fix the issues I‚Äôll come back. But it‚Äôs too frustrating. Nike Run is now a flagship app on the watches so i expect better.I used this app on my watch to help train for my first marathon. It was helpful with pace-setting, distance, and stats. I lost a couple short runs here and there due to sync failures, but I entered them manually. I will continue to use the app. 

BUT. 

It deleted my marathon at the finish line! For real. I crossed the line, hit pause, and it vanished. My whole summer of training led up to this point, and it was gone. I mean, I know there are worse things in the world then this, but it was disappointing for sure. I really wanted to study my split times and pace. Maybe I hit a button that made it disappear, and the fault lies with me? Well, if so, that is a design issue that needs to be addressed. 

Also: the ‚Äúleaderboard,‚Äù on which certain people consistently run hundreds and hundreds of miles per week, week after week after week, is absurd, absolutely absurd. Today is September 5; already the ‚Äúleader‚Äù had posted 422 miles. Another account under the same name has posted 267 miles. These accounts are always, always present. I don‚Äôt understand why Nike doesn‚Äôt fix what is so obviously not real. It communicates to me that the tech team isn‚Äôt paying attention or doesn‚Äôt actually care about end-users, and it leaves me unsurprised that my run would vanish at the finish. I mean, why wouldn‚Äôt it, when they don‚Äôt seem to care about fixing something like the leaderboard?",0,Goodbye for nowHelpful for most part but two glaring flaws,sarahbelle88802review,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run Club,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,476,has_leaderboard,31

Or at least have the leaderboard be users in the nearby area or something because they leaderboard is the same people months on months who are supposedly clocking over 5,000mi a month. That‚Äôs 178mi a day. It‚Äôs not possible. But they don‚Äôt seem to want to do anything about all the fake/cheating accounts. 

As for watches, I wish it worked with my Fitbit.

Edit: that review was written almost a year ago and they haven‚Äôt fixed the leaderboard. I now have an Apple Watch and it‚Äôs been going great until for some reason it stopped counting my runs toward challenges. It accurately counts my runs in the weekly challenge, but hasn‚Äôt updated the 50k or 100k challenge in four days. It still says I only have 25 miles when I have almost 40. I don‚Äôt believe they read these reviews and their customer service hours are minimal. They have no online support, only a toll free number. They obviously don‚Äôt care about the users since they aren‚Äôt keen on fixing any of the functional errors of the app.The app isn‚Äôt perfect, but it would be a lot better if they would take action on the leaderboard trolls. I‚Äôd like to see real people at the top of the leaderboard. You can only see the top ten and the people at your exact level, no one in between. I look at the top ten for motivation, but they‚Äôre always fake accounts making it look like they run 2,500 miles/week. It‚Äôs the same accounts every week, so NRC is obviously doing nothing to stop it. 
I‚Äôd also like to see more guided treadmill runs. It snows for 9 months out of the year where I live and I‚Äôm not running in it. I‚Äôd like more challenging training runs for the treadmill (hills/Fartlek) to keep my training interesting. I‚Äôd like to see more guided runs from the guy who narrated the Roller Coaster treadmill run. He talked just the right amount and I could listen to that voice all day!This app is always lagging so much. It‚Äôs extremely hard to scroll through the feed, leaderboard, and friends list (also too hard to unadd people or block them). Also, for even novice runners it‚Äôs normal to run 3 times a week, there shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúparticipation awards‚Äù. It‚Äôs super annoying to have the ‚Äúnew achievements‚Äù notification and then click and see that instead of a PR, it‚Äôs because you ran 3 days in a week! Well of course I did, it‚Äôs called not being lazy. At least, there should be a way to toggle those achievements on/off. AND don‚Äôt get me started on the 43 notifications from friends saying they went on a run. There should be a way to toggle those on the receiver‚Äôs end too. For the sake of everyone else, I have my runs go ‚Äúunnotified‚Äù. Other than that, everything else is okay, the UI is excellent.Recently, I haven‚Äôt been able to view the friends leaderboard and challenges page.  Every time I get on it, it shuts the app off.  Also, when I add my run manually, it doesn‚Äôt apply to any challenges that I am a part of.  Hoping these can get fixed.  The home page also doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore, idk why.  It also only tacks when connected to Wi-Fi or cell service, just a thought: What if they used GPS to track your run, in case your cellular or Wi-Fi goes out?

That being said, there are some annoying problem that occur. Not infrequently, I start my run and to then open the app at the end of it only to find it glitched out was not tracking my milage and split times. Additionally, the leaderboards are completely plagued by hackers (people running 4,000 miles a month, which could only be possible if they ran 7 marathons a day at near world records speed) which ruins what could be a super fun thing!

Since so I‚Äôve been getting more into joining challenges, to you know, challenge myself. But these leaderboards are just ridiculous. People running 2,000 miles in less than a month? Seriously? There has to be a way to enforce such cheating. These random people running 3.1 marathons a day everyday ,every month??? Where are these Olympians??? Please fix this issue because there are real people actually running and want a chance to have their hard work actually recognized. I‚Äôm sure others have thought of the same thing. I‚Äôm by no means an insanely great runner, but being in the top 20-40% of these challenges despite there being these absurd mile numbers doesn‚Äôt even make sense, it defeats the purpose of a challenge. It would feel good to know that you're having friendly competitions with other people who REALLY run and care. Please please please realize this, thank you.Best running app for Apple Watch owners.

Improvements needed:

1) Clear description of a workout before it starts. For example, it is important to understand if one needs to find (drive to) a hill to before starting running,

2) leaderboard on watch

3) Some coaches are really bad in explaining the workout. One told that the workout is like a hill where we turn in the middle and run back down. Described first speed as 4/10 (that is easy to understand), but after that all sections were little faster. Apparently after half-point the speed continued to be little faster. How about using x/10 effort for each part and telling ahead of time that speed increases throughout the workout. 

Bugs critical to fix:

1) If I play music and happens to say ""hey siri, next"" just when nike app starts speaking, it disables the guidance for the rest of the workout. Ruining the whole run. (I have Apple Watch Ultra, LTE, if that matters)

2) workout sync to phone (NRC app) is unreliable. One sometimes needs to restart the app.

3) app ofter crashes on start. Needs to close and start couple of times.

4) app sometimes do not show ongoing training program. Needs couple of restarts to fix it.

5) guidance download progress indicator is white on sometimes white background. Not very helpful.I was using a different, older running app for so long because I didn‚Äôt want to leave my stats and records. But after a break from serious running, I decided to switch to Nike Run Club! I love the way the app visualizes the results of an individual run and as whole the app is much more than just a run tracking app. 

One thing I‚Äôm really missing though is a way to track weekly and monthly mileage. Weekly mileage is so important for measuring progress and preventing injury when training for a race. I found a way to see my weekly mileage on the leaderboard, but it only tracks back 1 week, doesn‚Äôt tell me everything I want to know, and isn‚Äôt a good experience to quickly compare weeks or months. 

So if there‚Äôs any product people reading this, please build out the run history section to track mileage/stats over time!I have been using the NRC app for years and it works great for tracking you runs and history. However there haven‚Äôt been many updates to some of the features in a while. For example, when sharing your runs the ‚Äústickers‚Äù are the same old one. You can only use the same ‚Äúpre lives‚Äù ‚Äúwe running today‚Äù or little fluffy cloud person stretching so many times. Add a new sticker pack. Also it would be nice to see more info about your friends runs. Right now all you can see is their mileage on the leaderboard. It would be nice to see more stats like pace, average run distance and what not. Freshen up. Nice guided runs being added but that‚Äôs not enough for a five star rating.Well-built and beautiful app, however it‚Äôs missing a few things that feel like they should be automatic in an app like this.  I would like to see:  
    1) An option to share and view the full analytics of runs (i.e. I want that beautiful menu that comes up for my runs to come up for others runs) 
    2) An option to automatically post to feed on completion of a run 
    3) Better handling of leaderboards.  There are a few trolls that clearly and regularly spoof their milage on challenges.  (e.g. it‚Äôs been 8 hours since the start of this week‚Äôs 15k challenge and someone already has over 100 miles)

Other suggestions:
    1)  It seems like Nike wants this to be a strong mix between a running app and a social media app.  They should take more from popular social media apps if that‚Äôs the case.  Location based stickers, stories, etc.
    2)  More should be done with clubs. There are actual running clubs everywhere,  allow them to create clubs on the app and to keep track to stats through the app.Some great improvement would be an easier way for people to add others maybe specific user names or profile codes , because many people have the same name name and it can be hard to find a friend .
Also for leaderboards and achievements  it‚Äôs discouraging that the app allows people to log miles while riding a bike. This throws off the leaderboards and your placement in weekly or monthly challenges . People log way more miles on a bike that is realistic to run in a month. 

Overall great app; those small
Improvements I think could make it perfect and create a true Nike run club for runners rather then a biking club .I‚Äôd really like to see a more comprehensive and detailed breakdown of my past runs. For example, I‚Äôd like to be able to see a Weekly or Monthly average section.

Or a section that shows me previous PRs, not just the current top time or distance etc. It would be nice if there was a section of the app dedicated to your progression as a runner and being able to look back at past milestones.

Also running with a Nike Apple Watch can be really annoying because the touch screen gets all sweaty which makes it almost impossible to stop and start splits and it would be really helpful to use one of the buttons on the watch as an alternative. 

Overall I really like this app and use it almost daily and it‚Äôs made me a better runner and athlete and person. Coach Bennett is the GOAT. 

However, I do expect a little bit more from the Nike Run Club app. 

Also, please do something about the cheaters on the leaderboards. It‚Äôs really obnoxious.In general, I like the Nike Run Club app, but I don‚Äôt like the latest changes. I focus on month-by-month and the app now defaults to the year summary on the Activity tab. I preferred going to Achievements and Run Levels directly from each run rather than having to scroll to the bottom of the Activity page. And the most recent update requires me to click on each Achievement, close that one, and click on another ‚Äî previously, one could scroll right-to-left to see successive achievements. I do like the motivation of the Leaderboard.Ok, I have used this app religiously for years, recently hitting the Black level at over 3,107+ miles. Every mile is genuine, because I want to track myself.

When Nike started the ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù it sounded like a great way to see how I stack up with the NRC community. However, while I recognize there are some major runners out there, the fact that these challenges are consistently filled with people claiming 300+ mile weeks and 1800+ mile months is absurd and defeats the challenge.

This seems like a super easy fix, banning anyone found to be creating false entries. Put a distance and speed limit on the daily/weekly totals, and find a way for high level runners and ultra-marathoners to ‚Äúverify‚Äù their accounts to go beyond the standard limits. Otherwise, the leaderboards and percentiles are useless.

Just such an annoying issue, and the fix seems so east that it‚Äôs particularly frustrating.",0,"Fix ChallengesOverall greatAlmost PerfectFunctional good, but kind of staleMissing a few simple thingsSmall improvementsA Few Quality of Life Changes NeededNot a Fan of ChangesGreat App, But No Moderation of Challenges",getmeggedJo18tianitakyoJottisuniquenicknameplswilfredo ortizAndrewWilliamFoxAllenKenyaMcMahon615,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,9,4,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,1382,has_leaderboard,31

Usually these issues resolve (unfreeze) within a couple of minutes, but occasionally (maybe a few times/yr) I do end up losing my run data and having to enter a run manually.

It is my go to app above all the other popular running apps such as Strava, Map My Run, and Run Keeper. Although it doesn‚Äôt have as many features to offer as some, it still is my go to. Below are my top 5 reasons why I love this virtual running log/app. 

It‚Äôs free! There‚Äôs training plans with a coach and those are also free! (Majority If other running apps training plans cost you a monthly fee)
The training plans in Nike Run Club are able to be customized to what day of the week you want to do each run.
You easily stay motivated with virtual medals awarded to you with each milestone you achieve. 
You can compete with friends who also have the Nike Run Club app. There is also a leaderboard of all your friends ranked depending on the their runs. 
You can add what shoe you are running and it will keep track of the distance you have put in those shoes. This is great to keep and eye out for when it‚Äôs time to get new shoes.i‚Äôve been using NRC for about a year, almost as long as i‚Äôve been running for. my only major complaint would be the inaccurate treadmill running calculations. it would be nice if we could do treadmill runs at a specific speed, and then calibrate the app to what the treadmill says we did. the cheaters on the leaderboards are frustrating, and it seems it would be pretty easy for Nike to do something about them. more refined data metrics would be nice, such as how my average pace has changed throughout the year.",0,Long term userWorth itso close to perfect,LauramyfldErinPrunsbappleboy911,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,390,has_leaderboard,31

Leveling up through the colors is awesome, but once you are stuck at a certain one, you want to go back and experience some of the other colors again and that is not possible. I am suggesting that you should be able to pick your run color whenever you want, if you have already unlocked that one. Sometimes when I go for a run, my screen goes dark and I can‚Äôt access my run, and the only way to stop my run is to remember where the buttons are, this is a good bug to be fixed in this app. Another bug to be fixed is sometimes when I run on the treadmill, and input my run, it doubles that runs mileage on the leaderboards. On your stats you have the correct mileage, but your friends see that you ahead of what you currently are for the week, month, and year. A final suggestion would be able to see your friends full stats‚Ä¶ all time mileage, etc. those graphs that we seen on our screen should be accessible to friends if allowed in settings. I hope someone reads this and continues to suggest these things, or someone from Nike reads this and takes my suggestions into account somehow. This is an amazing app, thanks!Why does it notify me when someone runs that‚Äôs not in my challenge but doesn‚Äôt notify me when someone gets a head that‚Äôs in my challenge??

But I don‚Äôt check for 3 hours and I don‚Äôt get notified that I get passed or someone in my friends list/leaderboard goes on a run. Make notifications consistent! When any friend or self made challenge is made, notifications need to be consistent.

On the brighter side, the run tracking has become much more consistent and the leaderboard charts among your Nike network contacts are accurate actually update properly making this a really cool way to connect with competitive friends. 

Overall, much better than before and certainly the best free running app out. 

Used to love this app, but the recent update makes it unnecessarily difficult to use. They greatly diminished the actual attractive social features of this app by making it very challenging to interact with your real friends and compare activity. In place of that, they produced a half-hearted attempt of user interaction that stars a newsfeed of irrelevant running posts. It's now harder to modify standard settings, add friends, and just enjoy the app. Trim it downI was a complete beginner when I started using this app 2 years ago and my running has improved tremendously!  I love looking at all the stats that it keeps track of to see how much I‚Äôve improved, however, I would love for them to add a personal ‚Äúleaderboard‚Äù section. Right now it only shows your fastest mile, 5k etc., but it would be cool to see maybe my top 5 fastest miles instead of just the fastest. This way I could see how much I shattered my previous personal records and see how much I‚Äôve improved over time.  Overall this app is great!The app is really responsive and has nice stats and content that motivate to go out and run. 
The prizes of the challenges should be delivered worldwide (we are talking about mike company... it‚Äôs unbelievable that only us citizens can participate) 
Another thing is that it should have challenges where the leaderboards are based on the time you do in a run, and not in the total km you run (as it works now)
In the Apple Watch it works, but when you try to finish or pause the workout it is really slow... please fix that now!!The guided runs are a good source for changing up my workouts and the intervals in Party have produced excellent results! It‚Äôs also nice to have my stats easily accessed on my watch or phone!!
  Had a run show on the home face Last run 2.50 but didn‚Äôt go to my history. I then added it and it showed in History and my Leaderboard but not in my 100k challenge. Can you fix this bug?

When I don‚Äôt have the runs I need for the week it changes the Niels for the rest of the next week, negatively impacting my plan. When I run on my treadmill indoors the app constantly stops the runs cuz it doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm moving since the Apple Watch overrides the indoor run and sets it to an  outdoor run. The whole things so complicated now and it‚Äôs more worried about people shopping on the Nike store or cheating on challenges that I can‚Äôt even use the app for what it start out being about, freakin training plans. This app has lost its way and I‚Äôm moving on, I would have liked to get passed purple level but this thing keeps going downhill (in a bad way). 

TLDR: 0/5 stars, don‚Äôt bother with this junk and use Strava instead.Challenges have been updated to prevent anyone who was manually changing miles to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù from unfairly winning the challenges. While Nike‚Äôs attempt to make things fair for users is appreciated, I‚Äôm disappointed that my indoor runs don‚Äôt count toward challenges anymore. My calibration is about 1.5 miles off for indoor runs (for example, if I run 3.5 miles I get a 2-mile run on the app) using an armband. I have to edit my runs so that the poor app calibration doesn‚Äôt tank my speed record and keeps an accurate log of my miles. Following the challenges was fun and kept me motivated to log miles even on days when I thought I was too busy or tired to run. Leaving out users who have to edit their indoor runs is silly. Why not change the algorithm to filter out ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù run edits (say, 1000 miles in a day) but keep reasonable ones (bumping a 4 mile run to its actual distance from the 1.8 recorded by the app)? Come on, Nike+, if users are meant to avoid shortcuts then so should you. Develop a better algorithm for filtering out cheaters from challenges and fix your indoor run calibration.Every time I run, the recorded mileage and pace is extremely inaccurate (either pacing me at a 7 min mile or the opposite at 17 min/mile). 

It does not ever record the mileage correctly. Every run, I either have to add a mile and a half separately or it is recorded as a 7 min/mi and I‚Äôm at mile 7 when I‚Äôve only done 5 1/2. 

I have multiple outdoor runs where I have no idea what my distance really was because it doesn‚Äôt even record accurately on a treadmill where I am mostly a consistent pace the entire time..

It is also frustrating that when I am on a treadmill (and I have the correct data right in front of me) even though the app is frequently pacing me at a 17 minute mile I can‚Äôt update it so it is correct bc that means that the mileage won‚Äôt count towards my challenges. It completely kills my motivation. 

I wonder how I am supposed to know how far I am actually going when I‚Äôm outside if it can‚Äôt even record an indoor run properly. 

Whatever motivation I once got from this app just isn‚Äôt there anymore because it‚Äôs overshadowed by the frustration of not having my runs record properly and not having the ability to update it without it not counting towards my monthly mileage.

 Plus it is extremely frustrating to not be able to accurately track my mileage and pace so I can track my progress. I‚Äôd never use this app to train for any run.I seriously wanted to love this app... I can share with my running buddy, the challenges help motivate me to get my mileage in for the week, etc., BUT it keeps losing my runs! I get done with a run, it cheers me and tells me my run stats, but then completely disappears from my watch and phone app. This has happen numerous times over the past couple of weeks. It has also stopped recording in the middle of a 10 mile run, so I have to start a new run which throws off all of my metrics. Also, if I pause to re-tie my shoe it randomly unpauses and re-pauses on its own with very little movement, then when I start up again it doesn‚Äôt unpause to begin tracking again. Lastly, there have been a couple of instances where I started a run, ran at least 5 miles, only to find out that it stopped tracking my distance/route so at the end it says that I ran 0.1 miles in an hour.
Wayyy too many glitches considering I have only been using this app for 2 months. Super disappointed.The latest patch broke many things. The mileage on your challenges now double for a single run. If you contact support they can fix it for history, but then it come right back after a few runs. If they make a fix to a run it also unpairs your iwatch from your phone every time. Achievements have been moved down to the very bottom of the screen and makes them unimportant now. In personal records, the date stamp field has been overwritten by the duration field. Duration is already listed though so now you have 2 fields listed on the personal record tab that are duplicative and you cant see when you achieved your new personal record. This must be tough for nrc to fix as its been a month that it has been broken. This shows nrc is out of touch with the app users. As the motivational components of the app are now broken or made an after thought. This app is not for people that run daily anymore.After close to 3 years of using this app there are some reasons to use this app, although most of them will be available on many others as well, things like tracking your run with GPS, guided runs and weekly challenges. The main reason not to use this app is the horrible run syncing and intermittent  crashing that will leave you refreshing your app for up to 20 minutes just to sync a run, or should you be lucky enough your app will just crash mid run and you will have no recourse but to forget it ever happened and you will lose any progress you might have made. If the horrid syncing issue and crashing isn‚Äôt enough, you will never win or come close to finishing top 10 in your weekly or monthly challenges because some guy on a bicycle is going to log 1400 miles in a week and will be first place.I am ticked my running friends use this app to track our runs. The guided runs are good, but every time over the last 2 years i‚Äôve used the coaches runs it disappoints. Literally click start from the run scheduled for the day, complete it and it doesn‚Äôt record the run. it shows in my history, but doesn‚Äôt associat with my plan. When I had my iPhone 6+ thought it was because I had an old phone, the same on my 10. Yes, you can edit a run to add it to your plan but then that run won‚Äôt show on any leaderboards or challenges, because the edit feature allows you to change times and distances too. I use the app to stay connected with distant friends and want ALL my runs to show up. I wish my cheap friends would let us use a paid app that actually works and is supported.I‚Äôve contacted them, but have got no response. My miles aren‚Äôt tracking correctly. Says xx miles on the weekly 15k (which aren‚Äôt accurate if you look at my logged miles), then shows different set of miles for the October 50k and 100k. Started logging on October 5th, so all miles should count for October. So why are they different? 
It seems it either doesn‚Äôt log my miles correctly, or shows different miles in different locations, in my challenges....??? 

I‚Äôve deleted app, power cycled phone, and watch....still is all messed up. I have several friends who no longer use the app because it‚Äôs been an ongoing issue for well over a year. 

Sadly I have downloaded 3 other apps and those work much better, so if not fixed, I will be another user that‚Äôs gone and deleted the app. Nike! You‚Äôre losing people....please fix your bugs and issues....it‚Äôs been well over a year???? Really? You‚Äôve got more than enough money and resources to fix this. When I search online, I see more and more people complaining about your app....wow....that‚Äôs not a good thing for business! 

Please fix this stuff! Really, truly fix it.>My review before trying NRC>""Currently using the last Nike + app version and waiting for the developer to figure out that we don't want them to break the app we love. Not going to update to this new lime green nonsense until people stop reporting that they have lost their trophies and challenges. No way am I risking this new, not-broke-but-let's-fix-it-anyway, iteration.""

>Aug 2018 Review>
Finally had to update to NRC and immediately lost 40 miles worth of workouts, poof, gone. Now I often finish my five mile workout to find out it either didn't track most of it or just thinks I ran smaller number or just in a straight line for one city block and some how bent space and time to fit 5 miles in there... This version is absolute garbage I wish Asics made an app I could run with... then at least my app and my shoes would match.This app is pretty good overall. I like the guided runs and most of the features however the indoor runs are so frustrating. I live in an area that snows and ices over frequently in the winter, so normally have to take my runs inside. When I run inside I use my phone to watch Netflix, which means the app doesn‚Äôt calculate my mileage. No problem- I edit the run to have the correct time and distance. However  the app assumes I‚Äôm lying, and  those runs don‚Äôt count toward any of my challenges and goals I do with friends and coworkers, which is just ridiculous. I shouldn‚Äôt be judged for running indoors by an app, and I want all my challenges to reflect how far I‚Äôve actually ran. Please fix this so that indoor runners have options to keep up with challenges, which are a main motivation for me.Horrible job changing the challenges.   You allowed trolls to manipulate your app into a worse problem than it was before.   The problem with the challenges was people posting unreasonable mileage to top the leader board.  And what is the Nike fix?   Not to allow editing.   So the hell with people who live in cold weather and use a treadmill which the mileage always has to be edited.   And if you live in snowy cold weather and have to workout on a treadmill you are at a disadvantage from people who live in warm dry climates.       There was such a simple fix here - reasonableness!!!! If someone posts a hundred miles in a day it did not happen.  Get it?   Put a collar that editing can only be 10 percent of an indoor run.   Simple and makes sense.    Going to look for another app and will never buy a Nike product again.I have over 5000 miles logged with Nike+ and Nike Run Club over maybe 1000 runs.  The good: it tracks distance, time, your splits.  With Apple Watch or other supported device you can track heart rate.  The bad: so many great past features have been dropped to make this a pretty bare bones running app.  It‚Äôs hard to see how many miles you‚Äôve run in a month or a year.  You can no longer see where you‚Äôve run except by opening each and every individual run.  Gone are the leaderboards with your friends or the integration with other social networks.  Challenges used to be really good but now they stink.  Completely dropped web support.  NRC is a shadow of what Nike+ used to be.  Over the years I‚Äôve gotten 50 or 100 to try Nike+ and honestly in good conscious I cannot recommend this app.Progressively terrible. Today I walked the same route I have walked for ages. Same speed. Two says ago, and forever before that, it registered as 4.16 miles (or so). Today, it measures as 2.97. Ridiculous! If I try to add miles, my run doesn't count towards challenges. 

I have used this app (and it's predecessors) for years. Now it is LESS functional and it is full of bugs. Half the time it takes over a minute of hang time before it even begins to track my run. I have to wait and watch it to make sure it is running or it may not track it at all! Can't retire shoes, so I have a mile-long list to sort through. No longer have the challenges. It is stale, buggy, hard to use and annoying.Yes, the app tracks your run. So, it functions. However, it does not function well. Any of the fun stuff, like challenges, work poorly. Did a challenge and it never calculated the results and it didn‚Äôt add my last runs. Reported it but still isn‚Äôt fixed. Super disappointing because my friends and I had been looking forward to seeing who won. I‚Äôve had other technical issues with the app like runs not showing up, the watch app not connecting, etc. I‚Äôm glad to have an excuse to finally give it up. Will not be using the app again.

1. Show friends level and/or miles. One of the most driving things is to not be outdone by your friends. People work hard to get to a certain level. What‚Äôs the point if nobody can see it but you?
Bring back challenges. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre gone completely or just hidden, but challenges were fun! It gets people moving who may not be moving. 
I‚Äôm not with all of the social stuff with strangers. I think the app is going in a direction of social media, but taking away from the social part of friends interacting with friends. I don‚Äôt see a need to share pictures of my run with strangers who could care less, just as I could care less about theirs. 
I also miss the part where we could get cheers from Facebook. That was motivation on your run. I used it all of the time. Then it was messed up where it posted a picture on my Facebook and and didn‚Äôt shut down the post when I was done running so people could comment on it all day....instead of just fixing that, I guess they just took that feature away completely.The idea behind this app is great ‚Äî my friends and family use is to create running challenges and then to compete against each other. It‚Äôs a fun way to get in those miles. 

BUT ‚Äî and this is a huge ‚Äúbut‚Äù ‚Äî the distance tracker built into the app is wildly inconsistent and inaccurate. It often under-counts my distance by as much as .25-.5 miles for every mile I run ... but then will randomly get the mileage right, without my  doing anything different. It might not sound like a lot in small increments, but when you run four miles and get credit for only three, it‚Äôs super annoying, especially when you‚Äôre in a competition for miles. In contrast, my treadmill, MapMyRun and Garmin are usually all within .1 miles of each other. 

So here‚Äôs my takeaway:  if you have a device that pairs with the app (a Garmin, shoes, etc.), this app might be for you (note that other apps with better distance tracking, like MapMyRun, don‚Äôt pair with this one). But if you will be relying on the app itself to track your progress, don‚Äôt bother. The progress tracker is so inaccurate, you will just end up frustrated.This app was terrific when it first launched for the watch.  Was the first running watch app that gave you everything you needed and was simple to use. A joy that made me so happy I invested in the Apple Watch.   Every subsequent update has made it worse.  The sync has become less reliable and I routinely lose several runs a month.  They just disappear from the watch after completion. Starting a run has become 5 to 10 minute exercise in frustration as the huge yellow start button on the watch face is often unresponsive. When you run at 5AM before work every minute counts.  The latest software update is now refusing to install on the watch at all, so now I have had to default back to the workout app that comes standard on the watch.  I have a suspicion that the massive amount of data associated with all the new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù like coaching and social networking and challenges (which are completely pointless) have overwhelmed the software / hardware and ruined what was a great product.  Nike and Apple... you are better than this.Really, what happened, Nike? I‚Äôve been using this app for over a year now and it‚Äôs always been my favorite- it‚Äôs got great features; you‚Äôre able to see your splits every kilometer, accurate GPS tracking, and it records the mileage you put on every pair of your running shoes. Etc. these are all things I love. And those are all things that I, upon opening the app, 97% OF THE TIME, can not access simply because the app freezes over, I can tap on my screen and nothing responds, and after about 20 or so seconds of complete inactivity the app just crashes. Im moving to another app now. Nike, please fix this. Adding new features such as guided runs and challenges are great but go do that once you fix the most basic functionalities. Or get rid of those extra features, even, if it means the app can finally run smoothly. You‚Äôre losing users, Nike, please fix these issues before you lose more. Sincerely.I‚Äôve been using Nike Run Club for years, and recently I‚Äôve been having the issue of it not recording any runs. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are doing a run plan, guided run, or just click the run button. As soon as you end your workout all the information disappears and doesn‚Äôt record. You then have to ‚Äúadd run‚Äù and type in all the info you remember, which doesn‚Äôt count towards challenges or plans. Yes my app and phone are updated to the latest softwares, and I do not use a watch or other device in companion w the app. Nike has been aware of this issue for YEARS according to online troubleshooting, and have not fixed it. 

What‚Äôs the point of a running tracker that doesn‚Äôt track?I have over 10 years of data on the NRC app, and never before had I experienced this issue over and over again on consecutive runs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the same issue occurs: you compete a run, hit pause before you officially stop or end your workout and BOOM! Everything disappears, there is run data to sync or history of your run and the Apple rings just overtake the iwatch screen. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP! Otherwise, there is truly no motivation to have this app or to use it. All my data can be created and stored with any other device or app, which is important when you are seeing to meet and exceed challenges and goals you have for yourself. THANKS!Great free app for running and analyzing your run data. It‚Äôs not for professionals‚Äô data collection nor is it suitable for significant miles (drains the battery HARD). Otherwise, love it. 

My complaints:
1. The app does not use manually imputed miles to count towards the weekly/monthly/occasion challenges. So, if I run where my phone doesn‚Äôt have service or if I use my watch instead, the miles won‚Äôt count which is a huge disincentive to using the app‚Äôs community-focused extras. 
2. The run app consistently fails to link to the Nike training app. On my race plans, the run app often has me doing a training day. But if I click on the training workout, the training app open, & I complete the workout, the run app does not recognize my completion despite the apps being linked. This then messes up my run plan because the system thinks I‚Äôm skipping some of my workouts.

Update: 
I‚Äôm becoming increasingly irritated that NRC and NTC won‚Äôt sync. It‚Äôs messing up my run plan, requiring the app to ‚Äúadapt‚Äù frequently because I‚Äôm constantly ‚Äúmissing‚Äù one of the assigned workouts. It‚Äôs ALWAYS my NTC workout. Fix it, Nike!I wanted so badly to like this app. The first month was strong; updates, motivation, weekly and monthly challenges. However, the app has had a hard time syncing runs (Apple Watch 3 w/ cellular) and has decided to not only not sync, but arbitrarily delete the run. And then, to add insult to injury, decided to log me out of the app. 

There are hundreds of apps that log your workout and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm looking for in a running app.  The second it stops doing the one task that I ask of it and the primary feature of the app itself, you have to realize that it‚Äôs not much of an app. It‚Äôs time to find a new one.I have always been a fan of the Nike Plus Running App from the time we had to run with our iPhones to track runs and the running shoes had a place to insert the tracker chip.

My main challenge with the Nike Run Club app on my Apple Series 2 Watch is that it tends to freeze during the run. It seems to still track the run but it a bit disconcerting when it does that while you run. I have noticed that the Apple Activity Running App does not have similar challenges. Maybe the two systems are interfering with each other as the Nike Run Club app is linked to the Apple Activity app.

My other challenge is that when you finish your run it very difficult to stop the run on the app as the touch screen does not respond well to sweaty hands. Can‚Äôt you configure it so that one stops the run using on of the buttons on the Apple Watch rather than the touch screen. This causes quite a bit of frustration

Or at least have the leaderboard be users in the nearby area or something because they leaderboard is the same people months on months who are supposedly clocking over 5,000mi a month. That‚Äôs 178mi a day. It‚Äôs not possible. But they don‚Äôt seem to want to do anything about all the fake/cheating accounts. 

As for watches, I wish it worked with my Fitbit.

Edit: that review was written almost a year ago and they haven‚Äôt fixed the leaderboard. I now have an Apple Watch and it‚Äôs been going great until for some reason it stopped counting my runs toward challenges. It accurately counts my runs in the weekly challenge, but hasn‚Äôt updated the 50k or 100k challenge in four days. It still says I only have 25 miles when I have almost 40. I don‚Äôt believe they read these reviews and their customer service hours are minimal. They have no online support, only a toll free number. They obviously don‚Äôt care about the users since they aren‚Äôt keen on fixing any of the functional errors of the app.I have not had an issue with running with this app OUTDOORS. I think it tracks accurately and gives useful information. I‚Äôve used some of the guides runs and have enjoyed them. My big problem is with how it tracks runs on the treadmill. To make it work, you have to HOLD THE PHONE IN YOUR HAND WHILE RUNNING ON THE TREADMILL. The instructions for the app(which I looked up) even say not to use an arm band! The app uses the accelerometer to track your run on the treadmill. This is nonsense!  You can enter a run in manually (and probably more accurately) but it won‚Äôt count towards any of the challenges. I have done this but am not pleased that my runs don‚Äôt count for challenges. I have never seen a person run on a treadmill with their phone in their hand. Not only would I think they were crazy but if you drop your phone while running on the treadmill I can see an accident potentially happening. Fix this issue and I would give it a 5 star rating. I like how this app syncs with the Nike Training Club app because I like to see all my workouts in one place.I‚Äôm a longtime user of this app.  I like a lot of the features: the challenges, the milestones, the awards, they all have helped motivate my runs at times.  But lately I‚Äôve been feeling that the coaching algorithm has changed for the worse.  It‚Äôs great if you are a beginner and are looking for a couch to 5k or 10k, but I‚Äôm a more experienced runner looking to improve my half marathon pace or take my distance up from 21k to 30k, or train for a full marathon with more than just speed intervals and benchmark runs....  I have also found that when I want to start a new training program and I‚Äôm averaging 25 - 30 miles per week the algorithm still starts me out in week 1 with some ridiculously small mileage, like a 3 mile tempo run, a speed interval run, a benchmark and a long run of 6 or 7 miles.....  I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôm completely done with NRC, but I‚Äôm definitely looking for a new training/coaching app to meet my needs.Extremely annoyed and disappointed in the Nike+ Run Club update. As a novice runner who came to love the Nike app for it‚Äôs user friendly features and more. I am extremely annoyed of the new update where I lost a lot of my date and had to uninstall and reinstall the application more than 5 times or it to work. It has not only froze on my during my runs where I had to force quit, I am extremely annoyed by the fact that most of its new features don‚Äôt even load. 

Additionally, challenges!! One of the best features to even exist in the running app was completely taken away. As someone who is new to running and have many friends who are against running, I was able to convince them to join me on my new fitness journey through the challenges app. However, with much disappointment‚Ä¶the day after we decided to start training together, we get this disgusting and sorry excuse for an update. 

No warning‚Ä¶data lost‚Ä¶frequent crashes‚Ä¶ I would give anything for the old application.

Update: the one component that I love with the Nike run app right now is the my coach feature which I was adaptable to the Apple Watch instead of just doing quick runs there and reassigning it later. I wish that it was adaptable because I would love to have the guided runs. 

Another disappointment.This app would be 5 stars if it didn‚Äôt glitch and crash all the time. They have these challenges which are motivating, but three times now in the last month I have finished a run, pushed stop, and the app crashes. It loses all data of my run and the miles don‚Äôt go towards my challenges I‚Äôm apart of, even if I manually enter my run. I called Apple to talk to them about it since I have the Nike Apple Watch and they said this complaint is happening to others and it has already been submitted to Nike. Unfortunately I will probably no longer use this app because I am training with multiple runs a week and the data from my runs is valuable, so I‚Äôll be switching to the Apple Watch running tracker since it is more reliable. Truly a bummer cause when this app works it is awesome - just too unreliable.I‚Äôve been using the app since about 2012. It‚Äôs okay for personal tracking, but when you start wanting to manage friends and run challenges the app is pretty limited in my opinion. It shouldn‚Äôt take me all day to figure out how to add my friends on the app. Furthermore, why can‚Äôt I see pending friend requests? I dont know... Also, it‚Äôs annoying during runs that the app will ‚Äúpause my workout‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt resume automatically. I‚Äôve lost a lot of my tracking during runs. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time baby sitting the app and having to reopen my lock screen and bring up the app just to restart the run a thousand times. It takes away from the run and slows me down being preoccupied with managing/ pushing buttons the whole time. I remember the app being better with this feature years ago.I used to love Nike Run Club. The coaching programs were great and the UI was good. Now it‚Äôs slow as molasses, and with every update seems to be getting worse. It forces you to see the map area even on indoor mode when you have the map disabled, when it just shows the space and says ‚Äúmap disabled‚Äù. I have to enter workout detail (effort level, where I ran, etc) multiple times to get it to save. This morning I tracked a speed workout (hate the current method of doing this that requires extra button presses over the way it used to work), starting from my plan screen. It lost the association with my plan *that I started from and that I didn‚Äôt touch* so I had to edit the run to fix it (meaning it won‚Äôt count toward challenges or anything now). So disappointed that an app that used to be awesome has gone so far downhill.I‚Äôm a loyal Nike Fan and for the most part I like the app. 

When using the app on my Apple Watch, long runs tend to take a while to sync with the app on my phone, it has happened a few times to where I end my run, the app lags, closes, and I then lose my run. If using the app on my phone I normally don‚Äôt have these issues, but it‚Äôs annoying looking at my phone while running, trying to keep pace. Along with that, if I start the run on my app and open the app on my watch, the two don‚Äôt sync together. Often times if I‚Äôm scared my run won‚Äôt sync and don‚Äôt want to deal with the headache of unlocking my phone to check pace, I start a run on both the app and the watch and just delete one of the runs when I‚Äôm done. 

Entering manual runs when runs don‚Äôt sync, it doesn‚Äôt count towards your weekly runs or challenges which is a bummer as well. 

I wish you can also compete with your previous run and get feedback if you‚Äôre ahead of pace or behind pace, but this feature has still not been available after multiple request. 

The app has a lot of potential for sure and I love it when it works but I hope they can figure out something with the syncing issues.Nike run club app has a great layout and helpful training plans however it is very glitchy. Specially when using the Apple Watch App version. Now I have Apple Watch series 4 so I don‚Äôt know if it happens to newer versions or not but I start a run and tracks me well and when I stop/review everything then try to sync with my phone....poof gone! Like nothing happened. It is quite annoying because I ‚Äúsign‚Äù up for weekly challenges and looks like I haven‚Äôt finished it. Sometimes it shows up on my activity center and shows that I used the Nike run app then the sync will show later but last few times...not even on activity center it says anything. Just that I was active for that period of time. Come on Nike! Fix this!I use the Nike+ app every time I run but it seems a bit slow on tracking distance during my runs.  My watch is always 6-9 Kim‚Äôs ahead of my iPod app.  Also, I see people who post their photos in other arts of the world with features that I do not have even on my phone, is there something I am missing or is it I can go to the website and adjust my settings to have all the features?  I am just bored with the basic stickers and features that have not changed in 2 years.  I do enjoy the challenges and runs with the pros. Just want updated basic options and a solution to why the gps on my iPod app is slow.  Thank you #justdoit

Justin BurtykI live in a very cold climate, so I don‚Äôt do much running outside. The indoor tracking on the treadmill or track is not very accurate (I‚Äôve compared it with my own calculations on the track and the time on the treadmill several times). For this reason I typically enter in my time and miles manually unless I‚Äôm running outside. But if I do this I can‚Äôt participate in any of the challenges. I wish there was a way to participate in challenges even if you enter your times manually, just for personal development. I don‚Äôt care about prizes or being the best, I just like to see a goal and work toward it with other people. Other than that, the app is pretty good.So I paused my run when I finished it, but it didn‚Äôt pause until I had been not moving for 30 seconds. So I went in to the app to edit the time to make it correct. The pace gets all messed up and for some reason I can‚Äôt see my heart rate. All that is bad enough, but now because I corrected the time of a run it isn‚Äôt counting toward my challenges!!!!! I‚Äôve been working hard for these and I really want my runs to count for it. And because June ends in 2 days, I‚Äôm not going to complete my challenge because this run didn‚Äôt count for no reason. Please fix Nike!!!! I‚Äôm a long time user and I‚Äôm considering switching to Strava because of this!!! ThanksWhile I love the Nike App currently I am not impressed with it when I use it on my Apple Watch. Each time I do a run it finishes the run but it does not save my run nor does it sync it to the app on my phone. I am not even able to locate the run on my list of runs completed. It‚Äôs as if I didn‚Äôt complete the run. So I end up manually adding each run. I don‚Äôt believe that is the purpose or effective because once you manually add a run it does not count towards any challenges I am participating in. I would love to know what this is about because I love Nike but if it can‚Äôt be fixed I am going to have to use another app.I‚Äôve used all the major running apps and have logged many runs.

The NRC app is good but the user experience could be greatly improved.

There are some major sync bugs that take away entire runs from you.  These don‚Äôt happen often but when they do - you loose the entire history of your run.  This has not happened with any other running app.

The community challenges are a joke.  There‚Äôs someone who logged 270,000 miles for the January 2020 challenge.  You couldn‚Äôt even drive that many miles.  What‚Äôs the point of a global challenge if you cannot compete against real users and real user data.

Lastly, the features do not consistently activate.  The announcer doesn‚Äôt always announce when I‚Äôve finished a run.  This is annoying when you are trying to run a set distance or pace.  

In spite of all this, I am a loyal.  And I think the core features are great.  But Nike - fix these issues!  Just do it!Recently, I haven‚Äôt been able to view the friends leaderboard and challenges page.  Every time I get on it, it shuts the app off.  Also, when I add my run manually, it doesn‚Äôt apply to any challenges that I am a part of.  Hoping these can get fixed.  The home page also doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore, idk why.  It also only tacks when connected to Wi-Fi or cell service, just a thought: What if they used GPS to track your run, in case your cellular or Wi-Fi goes out?  Again, just a thought.I‚Äôve been using this app for awhile and have really enjoyed it until about a week ago. All of a sudden my runs and NTC workouts are not saving on my training plan so my plan keeps adapting because it doesn‚Äôt recognize that I‚Äôm doing the plan as it‚Äôs lined out. I‚Äôve even tried using the ‚ÄúAdd Run‚Äù to manually enter my runs and it still is not applying them to my training plan....but all my workouts show in my History!  It‚Äôs very frustrating and takes away a lot of the motivation and competition as the miles aren‚Äôt applying to the challenges I‚Äôve entered.I have been using this app for sometime now and there are multiple things I am not happy with the way it works . If you accept any challenges , you can always see the top 10 or  more are running around 5000 miles in a month , we all know that is not possible , I raised this concern earlier too but no one did anything about it . Then the next issue is they app does not sync data between watch and phone , every other day I have to keep refreshing the watch to get that days run updated .

A run is about being just a little bit better then you were the day before, it‚Äôs about freedom. About leaving stress, or the things that ‚Äúbog‚Äù you down behind. At least for that little bit of time you‚Äôre running. I feel like those statements also hold true for this app. The app is better then it was, and I believe it will continue to be better. In the future however I want to see the interface be more intuitive, less ‚Äúbogged‚Äù down. I want the freedom of what a run feels like to translate into this app. I love the coach runs, I love the podcasts with coach Bennet. I love the challenges. Running is about the individual and as soon as I log Into this app the center of it all should be about me/ the individual. Then secondly: intuitively be more apart of my friends running. One example is, I would like to see their run color, and be more interactive with them (I do like the ‚Äúcheering on‚Äù) and their trophy‚Äôs. Also I definitely want to see the run club be more local. Or be able to set up a run club meet locally through the app. I have a love hate relationship with this app, I have a billion ideas for this thing, but totally have faith that they will get it right. That it will be better tomorrow then it is today.This app is great for tracking runs and providing motivation. The coaching feature works well for multiple different race types. 

Minor fixes could make NRC the best app around. There is a delay in the start/pause/stop buttons and get isn‚Äôt a huge problem..... until you accidentally stop a run mid-workout. There is no way to continue a paused run nor can you merge two runs. Once you are complete with your workout if you choose to edit your run you lose all credit for your miles in your challenges. This really takes away from the motivation factor this app is trying to accomplish. 

The minor fix to allow merging two runs would make this a ten-star app.Love the functionality and community aspect of the app. I have been using the NRC app for about a week and it really motivates you to keep running. However, one of the pain points for me is when adding a manual run during workouts where I don‚Äôt have my phone on me (I do orangetheory and other classes sometimes) the miles I log on the treadmill during those workouts are showing in my history, but not counting towards my challenges. I have run over 6 miles in the treadmill in these orangetheory workouts in the last 3 days and are not getting credit for it in my challenges. I think this functionality should be fixed.I think this app is great for someone with lower mileage like myself, and I can‚Äôt speak for the marathon runners out there. NRC motivates me to get off my couch and run using the weekly and monthly challenges. However, it would be nice to see more challenge variety, instead of my usual 15K weekly challenge. I also think it‚Äôs time to upgrade the awards, even if some of the awards are silly it would be nice to see something new. I have had several technical difficulties with freezing and not being able to start my run. Overall, I do recommend NRC to many if they are trying to get into running.I love the guided runs, they really help out. I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the app using my Apple Watch Series 3 but it works pretty good 8/10 on my series 7 and I‚Äôm glad I gave it another try. For some reason my challenges didn‚Äôt update for March, im still showing February‚Äôs challenges and March is almost over. And last month it took forever to recognize one of my runs which was a little disappointing but it did finally sync.

TL:DR It offers a good bit more than the standard workout app and the guided runs are excellent but can still be lacking on some of the simplest features.",0,"It‚Äôs getting betterCould be so much betterDecent but some things could be improvedNot bad, but room for improvementGreat app",colorpointgfxKirbyW1cbfit2019loma1133Okyeahy,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,5,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,709,has_challenges,139

Love the running coach, training programs, challenge creations, Headspace audios and the letterboards + awards. All that being said sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt work for me at all. If I start a run on my phone it won‚Äôt sync to my Apple Watch in real time or ever. If I start a run on my watch it won‚Äôt sync after the fact on my phone and add to my run history (but it does show up on the Activity app that comes with iPhone). On the watch it takes forever to end the workout no matter how many times I press stop. Once my current training program disappeared completely and took me back to the ‚Äúcreate a program‚Äù page. Also if I manually add a run it doesn‚Äôt seem to update in any challenges I‚Äôm enrolled in. Sometimes if I‚Äôm Running with Headspace the music in the background is louder than Coach Bennet and Andy so I can‚Äôt hear them unless I pause the music. So I wish these issues were fixed so I can enjoy the app again.I‚Äôve been using this app for about 1.5 years now, and have been running a lot more. Since so I‚Äôve been getting more into joining challenges, to you know, challenge myself. But these leaderboards are just ridiculous. People running 2,000 miles in less than a month? Seriously? There has to be a way to enforce such cheating. These random people running 3.1 marathons a day everyday ,every month??? Where are these Olympians??? Please fix this issue because there are real people actually running and want a chance to have their hard work actually recognized. I‚Äôm sure others have thought of the same thing. I‚Äôm by no means an insanely great runner, but being in the top 20-40% of these challenges despite there being these absurd mile numbers doesn‚Äôt even make sense, it defeats the purpose of a challenge. It would feel good to know that you're having friendly competitions with other people who REALLY run and care. Please please please realize this, thank you.Let me begin with, I love the features of this app. I am training for my second half marathon and enjoy the diversity of the features. For example, some runs I enjoy the guided whereas others I might just let the music play. The challenges are motivating along with the achievements, as well. 

The one area that I am really seeing the biggest problem with is the coaching. I started a training plan and all was well for a week or two. However, as I would press start and hear the halfway point warnings of my run, I would then find that it didn‚Äôt register to my coaching plan. I could see the run in the history but not in my coaching plan. This part is very frustrating as I am trying to track my progress throughout the training and have to search through the history in order to see how I am really doing. 

I began using Another app to track my progress, however I still use and love the features of NRC.Overall, this is a solid all around app. I have used it for about 5 years now. I really like it, however, it has a few issues that are frustrating.
Treadmill use: It doesn‚Äôt track your distance so well. I think it assumes your average rate, and then plugs it in what it thinks you have done. The bad side of that is if you try to fix the distance by matching it up to the treadmill in the end, it won‚Äôt count your mileage for any of your challenges. Kind of a waste.
Running outside: Occasional glitching. Most common is the tracking of a distance. I run a specific trail regularly. Approximately 100 times. It usually measures out at 3.24 to 3.25 miles. Other times it‚Äôs 3.19. Not that big of a deal, but if you edit the run to account for the missing distance at all, it will erase the entire run. A bit irritating. 
Then sometimes it glitches and delete runs at the completion.And although I stand by Nike and nothing else, this app has SO much potential that I think it‚Äôs not taking advantage of. Incorporating more of the social aspect would be better. Being able to interact w my friends on this app makes it more fun! But I can barely interact w them on here. The navigation is not very user friendly or necessarily at the point that it promotes engagement with one another. For example, a friend of mine goes running all the time but I can only occasionally ‚Äúcheer him on‚Äù through the app and support that he‚Äôs going for a run. For him, although I run twice a day every day, he never gets updates when I go for a run and he can‚Äôt cheer me on at all. If you could create a way for users to engage in friendly challenges to meet goals through the app that would also be great. I love this app and I LOVE Nike but I just wish there was more. ‚òπÔ∏èGreat app, I use it whenever I‚Äôve run, and I‚Äôve used it for almost a year now‚Äîso I really like it and i think it does a fantastic job, especially considering all the great features (shoe tracking, achievements, challenges, autopause, audio feedback, and more), but it has some serious problems.

Problems: General sluggishness. It often takes a bit to start up the run and will occasionally randomly pause and not start up until you do it manually. The big one is it glitches out and DOES NOT TRACK your whole run. I run the same route through Central Park everyday so I know about how far I‚Äôm running and it‚Äôs very frustrating when it only tracks 2 miles for the 7 miles I ran. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to hit goals and get accurate readings.

Some improvements: An option so whenever I auto pause I can hear the audio feedback about distance. The ability to have audio feedback tell me the time of day as well as the rest. Update the weird share feature to something more useful. I don‚Äôt know maybe modest Nike discounts for hitting certain milestones.

I never write reviews but I‚Äôm writing this one because I love this app, use it everyday, and want it to get better! Thanks Nike! :) #checksoverstripesStarted using this app in May as I started running with some friends who issued a challenge. Love the app but have had a couple issues with connecting with my Apple Watch and with GPS tracking. Only on a few occasions, I‚Äôve finished a run with my watch and watched the splits and breakdown and then pushed ‚Äúdone‚Äù only to not have it show up in my completed runs. This forced me to enter manually on my iPhone but since I have to enter manually it doesn‚Äôt count towards challenges. Also on a couple occasions the GPS didn‚Äôt track part of my run and the map showed me running through houses and backyards on a false line that cost me roughly a quarter mile. Honestly love the app just had a few issues and Nike‚Äôs support line has a 45+ minute wait time on their phone #.Nike run club is generally a great app - easy to use, helpful to track running history, and allows friendly competitions with friends and others to motivate yourself to run.

Two flaws around the Challenges need to be addressed. First being the need to prevent a significant number of people from deceiving the app into thinking they‚Äôve run 150 miles a day for 30 days straight. It‚Äôs frustrating to see and is obviously not the case.

Also, users should be notified that it‚Äôs the first of the month and they should join it right away to begin working to the goal. Consider ‚Äúlocking‚Äù it after some number of days to encourage that, or allow auto-enrollment based on a user setting.I have used this app since I started running. However, it's very buggy to switch tabs, music does not actually work while you run - especially the music controls they're just frozen and have no functionality. Also, I miss the challenges with friends, they were very motivating. I have to wait a good amount of time before being able to see my friends miles, or start a run because it doesn't respond well. This wasn't a problem when the app had first came out. I would also like to cheer on friends while I'm on my run and they're on theirs. I'll still continue to use the app but please at least fix the response time and bugs.I love this app and use it all the time. I use it for all of my distance tracking, BUT there are a few things I would like. 

Include miles and KM together so it can be viewed at a glance at any time so I don‚Äôt have to dig into settings and change it for certain workouts. This should not be complicated. 

Do better at weeding out the cheaters on the weekly and monthly challenges. No one runs 1,000 miles in four days üôÑ

I forgot to start a run today but remembered my route. It would be really nice to be able to draw the route on a map to get an accurate distance count. I had to go on google maps instead and add a million pins instead. 

It would be very very nice to be able to have at least 2 categories..walking and running. Like I said I use this app to track all my distances, including walking my dog. I don‚Äôt want to use multiple apps for this. I want to use this one. But my average pace gets all messed up in my metrics because there are walks and runs mixed in. Over the 4,500 miles I‚Äôve accrued so far these are my biggest disappointments.Well-built and beautiful app, however it‚Äôs missing a few things that feel like they should be automatic in an app like this.  I would like to see:  
    1) An option to share and view the full analytics of runs (i.e. I want that beautiful menu that comes up for my runs to come up for others runs) 
    2) An option to automatically post to feed on completion of a run 
    3) Better handling of leaderboards.  There are a few trolls that clearly and regularly spoof their milage on challenges.  (e.g. it‚Äôs been 8 hours since the start of this week‚Äôs 15k challenge and someone already has over 100 miles)

Other suggestions:
    1)  It seems like Nike wants this to be a strong mix between a running app and a social media app.  They should take more from popular social media apps if that‚Äôs the case.  Location based stickers, stories, etc.
    2)  More should be done with clubs. There are actual running clubs everywhere,  allow them to create clubs on the app and to keep track to stats through the app.I‚Äôve logged over 600 miles with this app and I love some of the features it has but it definitely has room to grow. I like being able to connect with friends but this part of the app needs more work. It just looks and feels like an afterthought rather than something designed with the app. I do love the detailed data the app gives you on the run but would love to see a way to measure and map my own routes and share them as a challenge. I‚Äôd also like to see the ability to switch from miles to kilometers quickly. I can‚Äôt change that I‚Äôm from the US and most challenges are measured in kilometers.This app is great but somethings need adjusting. 1. The challenges are bogus last month someone ran over 5,000 miles in a month which is an average of over 1,000 miles a week that‚Äôs about 150 miles a day. The challenges doesn‚Äôt mean much but there are some who feel deflated that there 40 or 50 miles in a month is nothing compared to people running almost 6,000 miles. It would be nice for those things to be realistic. Also my miles split seem to be a few seconds off from what the watch says when I look at it compared to what the voice tells me my split is please fix these issues thank youThis is really a great app and it has helped me improve on my runs a lot cause I can see the progress over time. I would give it a five star except for the fact that the app ghosts me several times lately when I‚Äôm in an active run. The routes are recorded with straight lines and I constantly have to restart the recording of a run cause the app has either crushed or stopped recording despite the fact that I lock the screen so that it doesn‚Äôt get interrupted while I‚Äôm running. For someone who is taking part in challenges this is really frustrating cause the app is not dependable. Hopefully they can fix this problem soonSome great improvement would be an easier way for people to add others maybe specific user names or profile codes , because many people have the same name name and it can be hard to find a friend .
Also for leaderboards and achievements  it‚Äôs discouraging that the app allows people to log miles while riding a bike. This throws off the leaderboards and your placement in weekly or monthly challenges . People log way more miles on a bike that is realistic to run in a month. 

Overall great app; those small
Improvements I think could make it perfect and create a true Nike run club for runners rather then a biking club .I love how I can run and join challenges and advance in levels, but when it comes to the friends I have connected with in the app, the experience is almost broken. Every time a friend goes on a run, the app prompts me to congratulate them for running. And every time I press on it to congratulate them, the app open to the opening screen. What is the point of the reminder popping up if there is no way to congratulate them in-app? Why am I goaded into getting more friends if there is no inter user communication at all? It seems pointless that it‚Äôs even a feature if it‚Äôs not being executed properly.I love the NRC. Started using last summer and now completed over 1200 km in a full year period.
Only issue I see is running on the treadmill. If you go speeds above 5.5 miles per hour, the app will not correctly get your distance. I found myself at speed treadmill runs with as much as half of the distance run.
Training plans are awesome awesome awesome. Coach Benet and others are very good. In comparison I also got the ASICS running app and tried the 1/2 marathon plan and it was not as inspiring as the Nike Running Club App. 
for improvement:
- try to improve accuracy on treadmills
- have heart rate sync with Fitbit
- On personal challenges we create, let us upload any image as badge. Selections are limited
- 20k run in the week 4 1/2 marathon has an issue on km 7 where you will hear Coach Benet say you are at 3k. Just ignore it if you are running as the app still counts right. Audio recording is off on km 7.Ok, I have used this app religiously for years, recently hitting the Black level at over 3,107+ miles. Every mile is genuine, because I want to track myself.

When Nike started the ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù it sounded like a great way to see how I stack up with the NRC community. However, while I recognize there are some major runners out there, the fact that these challenges are consistently filled with people claiming 300+ mile weeks and 1800+ mile months is absurd and defeats the challenge.

This seems like a super easy fix, banning anyone found to be creating false entries. Put a distance and speed limit on the daily/weekly totals, and find a way for high level runners and ultra-marathoners to ‚Äúverify‚Äù their accounts to go beyond the standard limits. Otherwise, the leaderboards and percentiles are useless.

Just such an annoying issue, and the fix seems so east that it‚Äôs particularly frustrating.It is great to track your running development and maintain motivation. The challenges are an awesome feature, to help you push yourself.
However, I would like to see an improvement or optimisation for syncing runs between Apple Watch and phone (I still have a run unsynced, from Jan 2nd of this year, in my watch, quite frustrating).
And does the app have a dark mode? If not can we add it? My runs tend to be in the early dark morning, dark mode for the phone would be nice.I‚Äôve been trying to use this for the past month and every time I have tried to, it‚Äôs constantly shut itself down and crashed. I‚Äôm training for a marathon that‚Äôs in March, so not having the adequate idea of training via access to my plan has put a damper on this latest review for Nike Plus. I‚Äôve been a user for a number of years now, and never had this much of a problem until now. I‚Äôm pretty frustrated. I also really want the challenges with friends to come back to the app.",0,"Great until it‚Äôs notFix ChallengesGreat up but has some glitchesGreat... mostly.Been a HUGE fan of Nike since I was 12Great, but not perfectFantastic with a couple bugs...Great app with easy to fix flawsI generally love this app but...So closeMissing a few simple thingsGreat App with room to grow!A great app but needs fixingGhostedSmall improvementsGreat tracker, with mediocre user experienceSmall issues on Treadmill but still awesomeGreat App, But No Moderation of ChallengesGreat motivation boosterConstantly crashing, yet updated",Ilovegoodappslikethisgetmeggednatgal315Titsmagee84Amirah21mskoehlBeaverLosTrevor_9Dori MayolderelicheuniquenicknameplsLen CSir HaitianMissFiniganwilfredo ortizkysnowplzKostetzerMcMahon615JvucanovicPinto11,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,4,20,0,0,1,2,4,2,3,0,2958,has_challenges,139

After I set up the Nike Run Club app and a nice pair of Nike running sneakers üëü I found myself wanting to run more and more. 
The coach is awesome it definitely helps with motivation specially if you‚Äôre a beginner. The tools you have in the app like the challenges are a great way to keep you from reaching your goals. The data is very detailed from heart rate to the pace of the run and of course the distance among other things. 
NOTE AND CAUTION: The only reason of why I gave it a 4 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è instead of 5 is because if by mistake you stop the current run on your watch and begin another, you can‚Äôt sync the two runs together. If you edit the info on a run manually like the miles or the time and you‚Äôre doing a challenge like the 15K it won‚Äôt count towards it. Other than that it‚Äôs great üëçüèº highly recommended for beginners.Recently, I wanted to get into running. The entire benefit of running had a lot to do with my choice of exercise. I read up on several running apps and most of them did not spark an interest for me. I ended up choosing this app because I was already Nike Club Member and why not give it a try. I started my first run with the ‚Äú Get Started Collection‚Äù and have been running ever since. The guided runs are awesome because I don‚Äôt get bored or distracted and I can‚Äôt actually get great tips on running. The challenges are also another great way for me to add extra runs in and to completes goals‚Ä¶and best of all‚Ä¶be proud of myself for doing it and making a commitment to myself that‚Ä¶yes I can do this! I‚Äôm planning to run a 5K and am currently running on this plan! I love running and I would have never stuck with it had it not been for NRC!I use this app to motivate myself to walk! It works great and I love having all of the different levels of challenges so that I feel motivated to make it to the next step. My only wish is that while I was actively in a ‚Äúrun‚Äù that I could view my previous runs and the challenges. This probably wouldn‚Äôt make sense to a runner but I usually go at a slower pace and am on my phone while walking. I always find myself wishing that I could see how many miles I needed to complete a challenge or wondering which route I had gone the last time. Otherwise the design of the app takes a little learning but it‚Äôs pretty clean. I had joined this app to join a club but the club disbanded but I find setting my own challenges and using the Nike challenges is enough to keep me motivated.I have been using the Nike Run Club app for a little over a year now and really do enjoy using it. It keeps me motivated and accountable being able to see my miles being logged as I go on my runs. Being able to invite friends and share challenges is a huge plus for me. It‚Äôs an incredible feature to be able to motivate your friends and keep yourself on track as well. The feature on my Apple Watch is also really cool. Being able to start my run with a couple buttons pushed keeps it very relaxed. This makes it very difficult to have an excuse why not to use the app.

I have only done a few of the guided runs but they were pretty fun. I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt done more? Note to self: do more guided runs.

The only set back I‚Äôve had is sometimes my runs will not log in appropriately when I go on outdoor runs. For some reason I‚Äôve had a few runs where it stopped recording my run for a couple miles and then kicks back on. This is frustrating when competing with your friends because you‚Äôll have to run those extra miles to show for on the app. 

All in all, very fun and easy to use app with awesome features to keep you motivated and be able hold yourself accountable. I have already brought in a few friends and will continue to recommend this app.Nike run club really helped me to improve my running. A year ago, when I was 12, I struggled running 2 miles, and I would stop at least 3 times in a 1.5 mile run-but now, a year later as a 13 year old, running is just so much better and I feel like Nike running club helped me to improve. Now, I almost never stop because the Nike running coach, coach Bennett really motivates me. I also love the guided runs. I also LOVE the monthly and weekly challenges that they have. I also have a couple of complaints. For every mile I run, the app says that I run only .9 miles-and that may seem like a small difference, but if I‚Äôm running 6 miles, it‚Äôs kind of annoying. Sometimes, the app says that i have 10 minute mile times when 2 other apps both say that I have 9 minute miles. But overall, it‚Äôs a great app.I really love this app and I‚Äôve been using it for years. I find the GPS mapping to be much more accurate than other apps. The guided runs are awesome. They make it easy to do speed and interval training, and on days when you need some motivation or just want to listen to something informative, the distance or timed guided runs are excellent. I especially love the weekly and monthly challenges to keep me on track, but this is where my lack of a 5th star comes into play. There has got to be a way to regulate participants‚Äô miles; some of them have to be bogus. Even ultra marathoners are not logging over 100 miles every single day, and this makes it discouraging for normal people just trying to stay motivated when we see that so-and-so logged over ‚Äú900 miles‚Äù in one week.I love this app and I wish more of my friends used it. I‚Äôve been using it for years, but recently I decided to give the challenges a try to push myself and I was disappointed to see that I can‚Äôt manually enter my miles. I run indoors because I workout while I‚Äôm at work so it‚Äôs easier for me. I think it would be a great idea to add personal challenges tailored to each person based on their activities. So if I run on average 9 miles per week, I‚Äôd get a challenge to run 15 miles or something like that. This would take your app to the next level, especially as far as training and motivating people all within a phone. That message you get at the end of a run is cool, but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if it was taken to that next level of personal touch? Hope you guys like my idea!I‚Äôve been using this app since 2013 to track runs, and other than the very occasional glitch, I‚Äôve loved it. The challenges, guided runs, and awards are perfect for me, as someone who needs extra motivation to get their run in when the weather isn‚Äôt great or when I‚Äôm tired. And the old layout, with each month laid out sequentially with the monthly stats easily accessible, and then a quick swipe to see the awards, was perfect to track my progress. The new layout looks sleeker in theory but feels much clunkier. I‚Äôm still going to use the app, bc it generally works well, I‚Äôve got now 8 years of progress saved in it, and, well, you can‚Äôt beat free. But I really wish they‚Äôd bring back the old layout! The clunkiness of the new layout is why I docked a star.The coach feature has been great for my marathon training. I am training for my first marathon and wasn't sure where or how to start so this has been a useful guide with distance, speed, and time challenges. However, my only complaint is that if I don't open the app on wifi it doesn't always record the coach challenge properly.  When I have started my runs from home (starting on wifi), it opens the coaching features and records my entire run properly. When I have gone to the park to run and opened the coach feature there, it doesn't always open. When this has happened I can still record my run and manually add it to one of my coaching runs challenges later.  This just doesn't work well when I have speed run challenges to complete.I have attempted to transition to competing running apps but I always come back to Nike Plus Run. I started using it back when a sensor needed to be inserted into a compatible Nike running shoe. Since then, the mile-based level system has helped motivate me to make running a long-term habit. I do like that the display can be rotated for use with an armband. The developers seem to have made the app adaptable to runners with all kinds of preferences. The app keeps run progress if it closes out during a run for whatever reason. I am glad that they brought back the achievement trophies to inspire short-term goals. I hope they expand on trophies and challenges such as the Sunday 5K run. I would recommend it to anyone who runs on their own as I do.I have been a longtime user of NRC.  I love the challenges and achievements as well as the guided runs.  I particularly enjoy the ability to run untethered from my iPhone with the watch app.  It is great for random or guided runs.  I highly recommend the ones that Coach Bennett does.  They get you started the right way.

The only thing that is missing is the ability to access My Coach runs from the watch.  This is particularly important on interval days where you may be doing a series of 100s, 200s, 400s, or 800s.  The phone app tracks and counts them, but it is cumbersome to continually access the phone.  If Nike would put this on their watch, they‚Äôd get the 5th star from me.  Everything else is awesome.Let me start by saying I truly love this app. I‚Äôm a new runner and NRC has helped keep me engaged and motivated through my first few months of running. I love the mileage tracking (both miles run and miles on your shoes). I love the coaching on guided runs. Coach Bennett has become a calming and comforting voice in my ear as I tick off the miles. The achievements, challenges, and badges earned have become great sources of pride and accomplishment for me. I‚Äôve only recently started reading the articles in the app but so far every one has been informative and helpful. 

With all that good there‚Äôs got to be some bad tho‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve had multiple runs (all indoor treadmill) not record even tho I listened to the entire guided run. And the app crashes or gets out of sync between watch and phone a lot. The Apple Watch app can be clunky at times. And the member link to the Nike store has never once worked for me. 

Suggestions‚Ä¶

Maybe award points per mile that can be exchanged for gear or discounts in the Nike store?This has been a helpful coaching guide and pace maker for my lifestyle. I‚Äôve just started running a few months ago - something I despised before because of some knee issues. I wast he‚Äôs the videos learned how to correct my form and was inspired by the challenges and badges to push myself to be better. The complaint I do have is when making a coaching Ol√°n there is a ‚Äúspeed‚Äù section I wish that part would just give you a ‚Äúready-set-go‚Äù for the 200m intervals it‚Äôs hard to try to sprint and keep track of 200m and reset the lap each time. It would be cool to be able to take a picture as well to track progress. Just a thoughtI love all the different features in this app! i access coaching via audio guided runs, complete challenges, view stats about my runs, and more all in one place. It keeps me motivated and informed about my workouts. I use this app often and i‚Äôm very glad i discovered it! one thing i would change is it needs to be easier to track intervals when running from quickstart. there is no way to efficiently track a fartlek, speed workout, or interval workout unless you do an audio guided workout. a feature needs to be added to structure or section quickstart runs. other than that, fantastic app!I really enjoy the challenges. I‚Äôm a person who isn‚Äôt competitive with others but I am super competitive with myself and visual challenges motivate me to get up and run even when I don‚Äôt feel like it. The only few annoyances are random glitches for example, sometimes there will be distance variations (mostly small but at least one time it was off by a good bit) indicated for the same exact run. The other is that one, and only one, of my runs didn‚Äôt show up as a synced run on my total runs, however the miles showed up in my challenge tally. All in all a good app.I‚Äôve been using the NRC app for over a year now. Overall, great app that keeps you accountable with challenges and achievements. Seamless, organizes your runs and works well with my Apple Watch series 5 GPS. I create weekly challenges with my friends as we are quite competitive. 

Why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars... there is lots of opportunity for improvement. It would be great if you could create re-occurring challenges each week so that you don‚Äôt have to create a new one and invite all your friends after the week expires.",0,"Almost perfect and excellent for beginners!!Great App to Get Into RunningUse for walking, wish I could see challenges while in a ‚Äúrun‚ÄùVery fun way to keep motivatedLove this app!Accurate and motivatingPersonal ChallengesOverall great, HATE the new layoutPretty goodMy running app of choice since 2012Great app with excellent motivational support.Bugs and glitches aside‚Ä¶this app is awesomeHelped me get started!best workout app ever!Keeps me motivatedFantastic run partner",ElCarlosianLoves 2 search wordsHeartoffictionWellnessbyFelipeAvaüè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàThelight252525MusicIsMyLove<3I did this for the levelsnike run app reviewPrimMadddmac3214MtgwesternmaCloudeeah_s_MusiqTickleTheCookieNitiBeats305king liam,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,16,1,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,2417,has_challenges,139

It‚Äôs been an incredible resource on my journey and took me from a casual runner to someone who just finished their first marathon and has more planned. While I adore the app‚Äôs training plans and UI, my one major gripe is that speed interval runs require you to be constantly staring at your phone to ensure you stop at the correct distance, and the structure of how the app considers ‚Äúlaps‚Äù means that your rest periods just end up bringing down your average pace significantly, rather than showing up as rest periods. Additionally, the social features are very much lacking. I use Strava as well, which is much more polished in this regard. When going to a friend‚Äôs profile, there is no way to see any of their runs or really any relevant information. The only friend interactions are cheering us on and doing challenges together, which I consider lacking.I usually run solo, as I am in a more rural area. The app allows for me to stay accountable to myself and continue to train. I especially like the guided runs through the phone app or connected to my Apple Watch. They are an added bit of coaching that makes me feel like someone expects me to get out there and run. 

Update: on a couple of the runs I‚Äôve done with only the Apple Watch guided runs the app will shut down/restart at the end of the run. All data is then lost and I have to do a manual entry. While I still know I ran the miles and put in the effort, those miles do not get counted toward monthly challenges (I understand why). It‚Äôs just frustrating to use a challenge as a target and have that effort not count because of a technology error. The ‚Äú6K Run‚Äù seems to be a common culprit. BTW I really like that particular run but I will probably not use it on the watch alone again.The tracking is pretty inconsistent. Some days it wants to log a run and other days it doesn‚Äôt. But when the app does decide to count one of my runs it‚Äôs very encouraging and motivating. But one time I had beat my 10K record, which I trained for for months, it didn‚Äôt count and the sync has been pending for almost six months now???? I stoped running for those six months because I was so upset. Now that I‚Äôm back it‚Äôs only my third run and it‚Äôs not keeping up or even counting any of my runs for the challenges nor are any of my stats consistent. For instance I ran for 45 minutes today and I did 2 miles. My splits reported back that my first mile was one minute and fifteen seconds while my second mile was over fourth five minutes long! Since the app produced such inaccurate results it doesn‚Äôt count toward any of my goals or competitions. I‚Äôm so over this.I absolutely love the Nike+ Run Club. It‚Äôs my running life, my bible for pace and distance, improvements and guidance on new and exciting training routines. Which is also the reason it frustrates me SO much that the treadmill pacer is horrendous! According to my treadmill speed I‚Äôm outpacing the Nike Run app by almost a mile. My pace on the app appears so slow that it ruins my speed record and I miss credit for distance which ruins my challenges. I‚Äôm not a racer or marathon runner... just a woman, mom, professional, casual runner who finds solace in this small bit of time I get for my own well-being. Please figure out how to fix how the treadmill miles are clocked in the app!! Thank you for making my runs more fun and keeping me motivated to be better! And thanks to Coach Bennett for helping me always find another starting line.I really like this app. I think I would love it if the coaching feature included warm up and cool down suggestions within the weekly mileage. Currently, it yells at me for doing ‚Äútoo many miles‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing inconsistent.‚Äù A minor complaint. 

Other minor complaints are: (1) challenges do not count runs that i‚Äôve edited. For example, i had to reduce the miles counted toward specific runs. Those runs were completely removed from my number in the challenges. (2) When it schedule NTC work, those do not count toward my training goals. So the weeks with NTC work schedules are marked as incomplete. 

A more significant concern is that the app never seems able to read my heart rate monitors, a problem i‚Äôve experienced for years. Every other running app reads my monitors with zero fuss. Why can‚Äôt NRC?The past 2 weeks, this app has not been working properly. I‚Äôve been using this app for 5 months now. Lately when I‚Äôm 2 miles into my run, the app will suddenly say ‚Äúresuming workout‚Äù!! It‚Äôs not keeping track at all. You can un 5 miles and when you‚Äôre done, you will look at your phone and see that it only recorded you running for 1 mile, if that! I‚Äôve entered my result manually and it doesn‚Äôt update the entered results for the challenges. This is all bad, this app really used to motivate me to get up and out there, it‚Äôs always exciting to see my progress and to get badges for challenges. I need my motivation, this needs to be fixed!!No joke. This app changed my life. I started running for physical and mental health reasons. The tracking functions. The watch companion app. The social functioncs. The challenges and awards system. I got hooked on running but also getting achievements on the app. Became obssesed with the achievements system. Its like a video game! 2 years of use my life is totally different. I dont think I would have stuck with running if it wasnt for this app and running has saved my life and gave me a second chance and a new start. Thank you Nike!I‚Äôve used the app for years, and love the tracking and the coaching features are excellent. I didn‚Äôt know how much I was missing until I started using those features (I esp. love Coach Bennett!) BUT- cmon Nike- what is with the challenges and all the leaders logging over 250 miles PER DAY??? Physically impossible and very aggravating to us striving to actually do something. Please cut the challenges until you can monitor and boot those people out. #boycottnikechallenges",0,"Great app, needs tiny bits of polishGreat Running PartnerMixed FeelingsFix the treadmill pacer!!Good for the basicsNot accurate, not updating!Best running app. Life changingLove the app, but challenges are a sad joke",nicorios99Eagle.daveJennifer JosephJacSpedBrotha OnaciSpinellie88HAN-TYUMI-CyboogieCcccc123,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,8,0,1,0,2,3,2,0,0,1095,has_challenges,139

I did, and have been on a fitness craze, lost a good amount of weight, and decided for 2022 to set a new goal - run in a race. Starting small - signed up for a local 5K at the end of March, but knew I‚Äôd need to up my running more seriously. My son is a runner and uses Strava and another friend uses the Nike Run App, and others use watches, devices, etc. I do not have an Apple watch and no plans to get one, so I read up on best running apps. For beginners (which I consider myself running wise) the NRC was rated best, hands down. So after downloading it and using it for about six weeks, I can honestly say I love it. I love the tracking mechanisms themselves, the challenges and badges and the guided runs. I feel those have all helped motivate and challenge me - esp monitoring my pace WHILE running because it is easy to slow down and get sluggish (at least for me). Maybe I will outgrow this app one day, as another reviewer mentioned. I would love that because it meant I actually achieved some of the goals I set! Wish me luck on my race!I used to be a runner back in my high school days and don‚Äôt we all wish we could be back to those speeds lol. Anyways I was told by my doctor that I was getting up there in weight (‚Äò6‚Äù6‚Äù 260 lbs). Granted that‚Äôs not heavy but I have a small / medium bone structure and my BMI hit over 30. I thought I was doing pretty well and carried the weight well‚Ä¶I stated this to my wife and she tried to kindly disagree. She didn‚Äôt call me fat but said I didn‚Äôt carry it as well as I thought‚Ä¶that stung. With my schedule I knew working out hours a day was not how I am wired so I went back to running. I was running about 3 times a week in May but hurt my meniscus and was out 6-8 weeks.

Anyways I recover and really try hard starting August 1 and has this app been one heck of a helper/motivator. I have watched my average mile drop almost 3 minutes!! I can check all my routes from all my runs. I love the challenges that I can do and see how I compare to everyone else. I know it‚Äôs my journey but I‚Äôm competitive lol. This app has been a great tool and helped me in my journey. I even got my wife to join!!

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs things that can be improved but right now I‚Äôm very happy with this app and recommend it!!i‚Äôm so thankful i found this app. i heard about it from tiktok about a year ago and have been using it since. i genuinely used to hate running; and it was because i would never know how to properly train. when i got this app, i started the ‚Äúget started‚Äù guided runs. BEST. DECISION. EVER!! it led me through a progression of getting in the groove of running more often and with more effort, also helping me fall in love with running! coach bennett has helped me so much. i know i‚Äôm running by myself but it helps a lot to hear his voice motivating and encouraging me; almost like having a digital run buddy! but at the same time, he pushes me just as a coach does! some days, when i just want to run to blow off steam and don‚Äôt feel like hearing a guided run, i just do an open run with a goal distance and try my best to hit the goal! i also love the challenges and how you can choose a realistic goal for yourself starting with something as simple as 3 miles a week. overall, i love how many options there are on this app and how it continues to challenge and motivate me. :)ok so this app is THE BEST app i‚Äôve ever downloaded and honestly changed my life. i‚Äôve been using this app for a month now and let me tell you i keep discovering new features and have yet to find a SINGLE FLAW. the app is super easy to use, and has a ton of extra features i‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt know you needed. it has lots of motivating factors, such as the run levels, which are a great initiative to keep going on regular runs. everyone loves to level up right? the guided runs (narrated by coach bennett my king) make it super easy to start and finish runs, with coach bennett cheering you on (and sometimes andy my other main man) and with the predetermined distance or duration, you know what to expect. you can also join in weekly or monthly challenges with the whole nike run club community and the in app shopping feature makes it easy to find and purchase shoes and other gear. i highly HIGHLY recommend this app if ur starting to run more seriously or just looking for a good tracking app for ur runs. GET THIS APP it‚Äôll blow you away with all its extra features, layout, and accessibility. 10/10!!!I started using NRC a little while back and became so frustrated because it wouldn‚Äôt work at all with my iWatch. It would pause my runs when on the treadmill and the guided runs never seemed to work. So I switched to Under Armour‚Äôs ‚ÄúMap My Run App‚Äù (which is still a very nice option). About a month ago I decided to see if improvements were made, because this app has some great features that are hard to pass up - like guided runs and coaching plans. Boy am I glad that I decided to give it another try!! Syncing has been seamless and I haven‚Äôt lost any runs. I love the watch app so much more than any other option too, it is a really great watch app. The challenges keep me motivated, though I would definitely appreciate if that was built out a little more, with more ‚Äúevents‚Äù, and also it would be nice to be able to connect more easily with other NRC users in my area, maybe give an opt-in option to enrich the social aspect of the app too. All in all, this is the best running app out there, especially with an iWatch!!!Have been using for 5 and 10K training since I was starting from scratch and had never run a race before. For the 5k I definitely over trained and ran more than the personalized plan that the app offers. I did very well for my first race and finished just over my goal. For my 10K I have yet to finish the training plan but have already beat the goal oh a e for my race next month. I definitely have followed the regime this go round and have realized my legs aren‚Äôt over trained and are fresher for each workout (lesson learned). I also love that the app keeps track of your personal PRs, lets you compare mileage to friends, and gives you challenges you can sign up for to push yourself and make the higher mileage more fun. Also the guided runs are nice and a great way to try something new and a new playlist you may not have considered before. I would definitely recommended this for beginners just getting started or even intermediate runners looking for a way to switch up their running and training.Try it out and stick with it. Everything you need for running all in one place, no excuses. I love the app. Had it for a few years now and it‚Äôs improved every time I open it up. At first I wasn‚Äôt very consistent, but now I run every day. If running/walking is something you really want to get into this is it. You might fall off and not run for months at a time, but the app still holds on to all of your previous runs. Because I could look back and see how long it was since I ran, it surprised me and that‚Äôs what helped me start running again. If you have shoes you can search the shoes and add them to see how many miles you‚Äôve ran with those shoes on. The app allows you to set goals while giving you ways to achieve them. With challenges, adding friends, and coaching, it‚Äôs the ideal app for athletes and the ‚Äúnon athletic regular people‚Äù. Install the app and hold on to it. Have fun. üëçüèæüíØI remember asking my friend which app I should use for my runs, and they suggested the Nike Rune App; And I am totally being honest my good mates, The Nike Run App is a üòö from the running gods my good mates. 

The app keeps me motivated, and it tells me what to do so I don‚Äôt mess up during my run. The app has an achievements section which makes running fun and feel less like a hassle, there is also a news feed that features all things running including tips, stories, motivational pieces and more. There is a challenges and events section where you can run with your friends or by yourself, this makes the app feel like a community. The running levels section is like a tier system, and it is based off of miles ran.

The app pauses your time when you are resting, and it tracks your elevation, average pacing, calories burnt, miles ran, time, and your beats per minute. You can edit the speed, distance, and time of your runs so you can challenge yourself, you can even mark laps around your course for your runs! The audio feedback feature can be edited to give your more- or - less feedback, and if you really don‚Äôt know what you are doing, there are courses under the My Coach sections which last from 4-8 weeks, and there are guided runs for some fun.

My overall verdict on the Nike Run Club app is a solid 10/10, a üòö from the running gods.I‚Äôve been running with Nike Run Club since I was in high school running cross country. Back then I had a coach to help guide me and push me to run the best I could but going into college I no longer had an in-person coach keeping me accountable and pushing me. Running is hard and as much of a mental challenge as it is a physical one.  It can be hard to motivate yourself to go on a run or train when you don‚Äôt have another person guiding you. But part of the reason I still find motivation to run is because of the plan options, guided runs, and challenges on this app.  All these options are great for beginners, people getting back into running after a break, and those who have been running for years. Give the app a try for a few weeks and you might be surprisedAccept challenges, hold yourself accountable, and commit to getting closer to a better you! I‚Äôve been running solid for the last how many months & now if I don‚Äôt run at least 15 miles a week I feel out of order. The app is not invasive or judgmental when it‚Äôs interacting with you and it does well to keep a solid record of cool statistics under si many metrics you don‚Äôt even consider to measure yourself under and so it provides endless perspectives for you to look at how improving your fitness can be celebrated. I have fallen in love with this app and I couldn‚Äôt be more happier at how easy & seamless the experience has fed into my competitive nature. 

Give it a solid month and tell me it doesn‚Äôt give you resources to level your fitness up!I really enjoy this application, I find that the features are incredibly useful for just about any situation I come to. The meditation runs are some of my favorites and I recommend them to many. Running is a huge mental battle for some so being able to help their mental state and perspective towards runs can be a life changer. The medals, goals and challenges really help me a lot. I find myself always pushing to get the next one, or get to the next run level. (Currently orange, but one foot in front of the other and I‚Äôll get there.) so  I recommend this for runners who have been running for a long time and those who are wanting to make a small change in their daily routine. Whomever you might be, definitely join the club.I use NRC with my Apple Watch Series 3 and I like how simple the interface is on the Watch because it makes starting and stopping runs super easy. I also like how well it integrates with the full-featured app on my phone, the achievements and the challenges really make me want to get in more miles even when I‚Äôm not practicing for Track or Cross Country. My one major gripe is the app always making me set it up with my phone again off my watch - usually this happens if my watch turns on and off again, and it‚Äôs super annoying to go to start a run only for it to say that it has to be setup with my phone. It‚Äôs happened more than it should, hence the four stars - however, if that gets fixed it‚Äôll be perfect for my needs.Like any exercise app (or any app) this one is not perfect. However, it is easy to use, it tracks the pertinent data, and gives you digital rewards for achievements.

The draw backs for me are not important and do not affect my goals.

I would be nice if it were easier to connect with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (like maybe with a 3rd party app, or phone number - not just an email address). I have had to send my info to people I want to run with and have them find me because many times I  do not have an the address my friend have associated with their account. Searching by name is not a help if they don‚Äôt have a picture that can identify them easily.

It would also be nice if it would sync with the other devices I have chosen to use (fitbit for me). I refuse to buy new devices just to sync them all to one specific app. So technically certain information is not captured in this app when I run (heart rate). which would be nice to see all in one place, but again not completely necessary. I just open my fitbit app and viola.

Anyway, it‚Äôs a great run tracker and fun to use. I really enjoy joining and creating challenges with my friends and fellow runners across the globe.The new audio guided runs are fun, and help keep me focused on the run without distracting me. That being said, the app doesn't track my runs correctly and I'm always having to add some distance. I do a lot of runs on a track, and I can be a mile in while the app shows a quarter mile. My pace is constantly showing around double my usually pace as well. The only time it seems to work is if I keep my phone open and on the app; not sure if I can trust in then either though. Used to work great a few months ago, and only started noticing this at the beginning on this year. Hopefully they can fix it soon. Other than that I love the app, and all the latest challenges and guides runs.I‚Äôve used this running app consistently for the past three-plus years. It has reliable run tracking and compiles the stats for each run in an easy to view format. Plus, there‚Äôs tons of runs to choose from: by distance, time, guided runs, etc. so there‚Äôs always something to keep you motivated. I also like the challenges where you can run with other NRC members towards a specific goal in a set amount of time. And it‚Äôs very customizable, so you can adjust the settings exactly to your preference for music, audio stats during your run, and more. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend theNike Run Club app to any other runners, regardless if you‚Äôre just starting out or are an avid runner.Just a great way to stay motivated to stick with your runs and help set and meet goals. Lots of cool features and the guided runs are a great way to get out and feel like you‚Äôre with company even if you‚Äôre running on your own which is the case for me most of the time. I am really enjoying the weekly and monthly challenges because it adds another layer of motivation and again, makes me feel like I am participating with a larger community even though I am usually running on my own. And even though it‚Äôs Nike and it‚Äôs all branded that way, I don‚Äôt feel like they are constantly just trying to sell me products or services and keep all the important features free of needless advertising or other gimmicks.I‚Äôve been running with Nike+ RunClub and the Apple Watch app for the past few weeks and have to say I love it. Definitely an essential app if you are a runner, and even more so if you have an Apple Watch.

Pros:
-Accurate run tracking (splits, elevation change, etc.)
-Challenges to keep you motivated to run
-Social feed to connect with friends
-Share directly to social media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
-Guided runs with famous athletes like Mo Farrah and even one with Kevin Hart
-Automatically pauses runs if you stop 
-Very accurate heart rate tracking during run from watch 
-Achievements to unlock, records fastest 1K, farthest distance covered, longest run, etc.

Cons:
-In my personal experience I‚Äôve had some difficulty syncing runs when I initiate them from the watch. If I initiate the run from the app on my phone it syncs everything perfectly. However I‚Äôd have liked to be able to just press start on my watch and have it sync just as well.

All in all it‚Äôs the perfect app for any runner and the experience is even better if you have an Apple Watch. Plus, it‚Äôs free so you have nothing to lose. Definitely give it a shot!Kudos to the creators of the NRC App. It is easily my favorite. I‚Äôve forever been a fan of the challenges. However, now that I am self training for a marathon I appreciate some of the other features such as the virtual coaching and plans, and the ability to track the mileage of your shoes, when you log your shoes with your run. The achievement badges are really motivational. 

The only con that I see is the community challenges. Sometimes when I join the NIke community challenges, people are logging hundreds/thousands of miles in on the first day. I know those numbers can‚Äôt possibly be correct, so it‚Äôs hard to know we‚Äôre you really rank. 

Over all..... Nike Run Club is awesome!I‚Äôve really enjoyed running with NRC over the last few years. There is a wide variety of runs that are fun and interesting to listen to. Even when I replay a run, I pick up on new things, and continue to find them motivating. I have recently started to participate in the challenges, and find they are a way to further motivate myself. My only suggestion is this: I recently moved to Beijing, and even though it is listed as an ‚Äúevent location‚Äù, there haven‚Äôt been any events. I would love to see one in Beijing, and think there are many runners who would participate. Thank you so much, Coach Bennett and NRC, for all of the great runs!I‚Äôve been using this app for seven years now and I absolutely LOVE IT! It truly taught me how to run which is something I never thought I could do. I especially love the guided runs, ability to connect with friends and cheer them on, and the variety of challenges to each month (they really help me stay consistent!) 

***One thing I would love to see is a guided series for kids/teens! Or even something like a parent/child series that you can do together. I think these could be such amazing tools for families to connect, support one another, build healthy habits, and grow together!I‚Äôve used every running app in the book, this one is by far the best.

The challenges are super motivating and I love how I get rewards for doing 9 miles every week! I also love how it tracks how many miles are on your running shoes, that‚Äôs convenient because I can never keep track

The only cons there are is there are a lot of fake accounts that run close to 100 miles a day. There‚Äôs no way that can be possible! If your mile time is 5 minutes, that would be close to 3 hours maybe? Maybe more of straight up running, and I know that you can‚Äôt run for 3 hours straight!

The app crashes occasionally, not all the time. It mainly crashes when I run and the phone screen is turned on. I started running with the screen off and the crashing has drastically decreased. When it does crash, it saves my data, which none of the other apps did before this one.

Thank you if you read this. Please change the fake accounts!Love love love the app!! From the encouragement when you finish most runs to the monthly and weekly run challenges and the great rewards for when you want to dive into the apparel, I‚Äôve only been happy using the app since the start. Getting back into running lately, and NRC is def the number one run app!

I do wish there was more celebration (some type of cool notification or animation)  for the achievements when finishing the 15k, 42k, 50k, but the medals are great and I love the setup and the rewards again are great and I‚Äôm grateful for those. 

Thanks for a great app and keep up the great work everyone!I have used this on and off since 2016 for soccer during high school as well as right now during my college years. I love the gym but for me running is the most challenging yet funnest exercise to do. Especially with music. This app is perfect to track my distance time and progress. The guided runs are also soooo perfect to start your journey and be motivated. Coach Bennet is honestly the best and I can‚Äôt thank the creators and him enough for this app. You can also start challenges with friends and help track and motivate each other! üí™üèΩcurrently started a challenge with my coworkers.I've had this app for years and have always loved it, but I was never really consistent with running until now. It is great for beginners and those who are more experienced. I RAVE about this to anyone that will listen. The challenges are a great way to keep you motivated and keep your reaching for new goals. I love that you can cheer others on while they're running and that you can view all your metrics in a very detailed fashion. You can control your music from your Apple watch (If you have one). It's great!! 10/10 recommend.This is my FAVORITE running app, and I‚Äôve had a few. Nike Run Club has so many options for how to take a guided run, so many challenges, and a ton of different ways to personalize your goals‚Äî ergo, personalizing your training to help you reach your goal. One of my favorite parts is that ITS FREE and even the Nike Pro just requires an email to access. They motivate you, remind you, and continually push you to keep going, go further, go harder, go faster. You can connect with friends and others going for the same goals and challenges. I‚Äôm really excited to work with Nike Run Club!This app is working great and I love many of the features. However, can we do something about the accounts in the challenges tab which OBVIOUSLY aren‚Äôt legit? For instance: Masami Nakada (there‚Äôs two of them but this applies to both) has apparently run nearly 1,000 miles every month for the last year or more. I HIGHLY DOUBT a single person is running 12,000+ miles a year. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I can‚Äôt imagine there are individuals who are running 32+ miles a day, every single day, for all eternity... can you all figure out a way to crack down on these accounts? Thank you!This app gives me motivation! I love it !! At first i was like ‚Äúi guess i‚Äôll use this app‚Äù

i‚Äôm the type of person who in video games i like to get all achievements... so when i saw that this app had achievements to unlock i was hooked! every day i try to run to get the streak achievement, i also try to run faster everyday even if it‚Äôs by split seconds i still want to beat my previous record. and i love the challenges too! amazing app honestly, if you want to run and record√© your run i highly recommend giving this a try! you‚Äôll be hooked instantly!I‚Äôm a big Nike guy and I enjoy this app a lot. I‚Äôve been using this app for years to record my run and journal them as well as keep some data to track. I really have enjoyed the guided runs lately. It‚Äôs been great to get me going to try to work on my speed as well as just motivating me. I like the usability of the app too! It‚Äôs easy to use most of the time and it‚Äôs just got a sleek look to it. 

I will say though, if Nike is listening I have some thoughts. 
-Do as much tracking for treadmill/indoor runs as for the outdoor runs such as run details/splits. 
-there‚Äôs only two training plans. Please make more for those that want to run different distances (1mi, 5k, 10k, etc.) and training plans for speed. While I‚Äôm on the training plans‚Ä¶ make it work on the Apple Watch! 
-Give more unique challenges. The usual 15k, 50k, 100k challenges are there but give us more of the unique challenges.Being someone who thought running just wasn‚Äôt for me, and after trying a handful of other apps recommended by other, this one really turned me into a runner. The things that kept me on this app: the challenges between friends and the guided runs. The guided runs not only keep you motivated and help keep your pace but they teach you how to run! Coach Bennet completely changed my running style and I didn‚Äôt even know I was running wrong. I even signed up for my first half marathon and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!I‚Äôm a long distance runner and I need to have some app to track down my paces for each mile. Luckily I found this app, I enjoy it a lot and I‚Äôll recommend it to any of my track teammates or long distance runners to use this app because of how great it is! I love how they have challenges every week or month of running 5k, 10k, 15, or even up to 50k and 100k. It tracks down my runs every time and my paces, my paces for each second of the run. This app has a lot of things!!

Please download!!!The app is really responsive and has nice stats and content that motivate to go out and run. 
The prizes of the challenges should be delivered worldwide (we are talking about mike company... it‚Äôs unbelievable that only us citizens can participate) 
Another thing is that it should have challenges where the leaderboards are based on the time you do in a run, and not in the total km you run (as it works now)
In the Apple Watch it works, but when you try to finish or pause the workout it is really slow... please fix that now!!I originally had a Fitbit when I ran, but once I switched to the Apple Watch I heard about this app from a friend. I was prepping for a half marathon and the coach feature was better than what I was doing, and perfect to keep me motivated each day. The adaptability if you miss a day is next to none. After the race the ability to link up with friends to create your own challenges really pushed me to keep running more. So many standard features! I will not be leaving this app anytime soon!I‚Äôve tried Runtastic, Map My Run  and Runtopia. NRC is the best app there is for runners. The Run Level system integrated in the app encourages you to compete against yourself and do better than the last week. The app also has a bunch of awards which, I admit, can get quite addicting and pushes you to run more. The clear layout of the history tab allows you to go back and monitor your improvements which can also be very motivating. NRC also connects you to a community of runners by doing weekly and monthly app-wide challenges.The training works really well, sticking to the plans have made a huge improvement in my training so much that I was able to complete training and run out my first marathon! 

I was a person who liked to run but my knees kept giving me issues, I started following the NRC workout challenges and focusing on spin ups and post run work suggested in the weekly plans. Needless to say the plans really helped!

Thanks NRC team, Daniel the Engineer and Coach Bennet!This is the best app if you want to track all your progress(miles) for running. It stops legit when you stop and continues when you start again. Very accurate and HIGHLY recommend if you are a runner. This app also provides some running challenges so if you‚Äôre ever bored of running straight, this app will give you a challenge that will be on the same level. No need to click or keep tracking the time. It does it for you! Let‚Äôs you know when you hit your target.For some time now I had been contemplating getting back in the shape to where I was previous to my accident, and felt that without the proper motivation and management, it would be another mediocre attempt at that. My wife pointed me in the right direction as she had already used this app and have to say, it is extremely easy to use and contains tons of useful information, stats, tests, challenges, etc. This is proving to be exactly what I needed to seriously get back into shape. Thank you Nike.I have always wanted to be a runner. This app helped me do that. Something about the community challenges & not feeling like I'm running alone even though I am. It's just enough positivity that I feel that I can do it.
I started just doing the five-minute runs until I could do those easy & gradually graduating until I could complete the first run & eventually the whole get started collection. I enjoy the library of guided runs.This App has motivated me and created a sense of community and unity during the COVID-19 pandemic. My friends, siblings and I have downloaded the App and even if we aren‚Äôt together, through challenges we keep each other motivated and run weekly. Never did I think I was gonna be able to run 80k in one month. This is coming from the same person that could barely do 4k in a day and would maybe run twice a week. Now I do a minimum of 20k a week and my last mile stone was 20k in two days. THANK YOU NIKE!I‚Äôve been using the NRC app since summer 2020 and I feel it‚Äôs better than others I‚Äôve used in the past because it keeps me engaged. The user experience of the app is simple and engaging. The guided runs are really helpful, especially when you may not feel up to running but want to get some miles in. The new update also has new challenges, which helps with engaging in the sport and the Nike Running community.I use nrc on my watch every run, I enjoy it because it keeps my mileage and shoes, and maps my run. But I have a small complaint on the challenges and I know this a being picky. But currently we are in march 2022 and today is march 25, the top people have shown to run upwards of 1,900 miles just 25 days in the month of March, let‚Äôs be honest nobody can run 76 miles a day. If they can I want to personally meet them. Nike be realistic you can fix thatI never write reviews, but I wanted to say thanks for helping me get back in shape.  I wish that running alone was incentive enough, but being able to accept challenges, earn badges, and look at my historical progress as I increase in distance and speed.  Thanks for that.  I appreciate being engaged as a customer ‚Äî Nike genuinely does a great job at that.  I can say that I am so much healthier after using this app for the past several months, and the motivation provided has truly helped me.  Thanks again!I Love using the app because it keeps me accountable on my runs. Love the monthly and weekly challenges. For my runs I use only my watch and it syncs my runs truly, although it has crash on me a couple of times. When that happens I have to enter my time and distance manually and is not cool because it doesn‚Äôt count them in the challenges. I just have to make up for dose lost miles. Another reason to run!! It is the best app to use!! Best app ever!!I got the app a while ago to track my personal distance. I love th features of the app, such as offering personalized training programs, giving you achievements for things like running 3x a wk or beating a personal record for how fast you ran or for how long. Also love the community challenges they put for everyone that used the app. Overall great, couldn‚Äôt recommend it more. Already put a few friends and family on and they love it too!I‚Äôm doing cross country in the fall and thought I needed a watch to track my progress but this app is free and works just as great!! It‚Äôll tell me when i‚Äôve ran a mile and tells me my total time and average pace. You can also add goals for your runs, join challenges, and listen to a coach for motivation! Highly recommend if you are looking for something simple but don‚Äôt want to spend a lot on a watch.Really simple and easy to use especially if you‚Äôre getting back into running. As of this time when I‚Äôm posting I am running in high school and I‚Äôm running for the top cross country and track team and everyone else uses garmins but this is amazing if you have to use your phone because it‚Äôs as accurate as Harmon watches I would say. Overall great app and I wouldn‚Äôt you any other one. Also the challenges and rewards are really fun and help you stay motivated!I downloaded this during quarantine times. I‚Äôve never ran so much like this. My buddy send me a challenge, and that first month I completed over 65 miles. You can join challenges that people are on worldwide, but with no pressure of course at your own paste. I also like doing the guided runs they have pre-programed, it‚Äôs  like having a coach right next to you for that extra motivation when needed. Highly recommend this app!This app is great for tracking your run mileage and routes. 

The only thing I wish they would implement is in the challenge portion of the app with a group you should have the option to view other people‚Äôs run stats. Like the time, and pace and maybe even the route if that‚Äôs not too personal. I think some people in the challenges are fabricating there distances for example riding a bike instead of truly running. 

But other than that it‚Äôs an excellent app!Add some sort of reward system for using the app more and more. Discounts for shopping online for instance. Runners love new shoes and Nike gear to wear out on runs, when at the gym, or a simple grocery store trip. With an incentive of a discount on Nike products, users will be driven to participate in challenges, create a healthy lifestyle. An overall experience that will reach friends and family to want to participate as well. Just an ideaThis app has been a godsend for my fitness. I hated running, like everyone,but the  guided runs make it much more fun. Not everything is an all out sprint. Adaptable plans to get you where you ant to be, the ability to add friends, using your own playlist, and the multiple awards and challenges you can receive and accept. Believe it or not, the little awards and badges you can receive are what initially motivated me and kept me going. I sincerely love this app.Please add a feature can join all challenges at one click. This version is good. Love the audio guide. Use that a lot. I love the recovery run audio guide. When people are talking to you and encouraging you when you are running. The time is flying. You feel more energy. Please bring more recovery run with different running time. Like 15 minutes recovery run. 30 minutes recovery run and 45 minutes recovery run.",0,"Perfect for novice runnersNRC really helpsLOVE LOVE LOVEEE this app!!!AMAZING AMAZING APPHas been very smooth lately!!Used to train for 5 & 10KInspiring & InteractiveAbsolutely Perfect.Like having a coach in your back pocketNIKE RUN CLUB is the biggest flexExcellent, recommend to new runners and vets.So close to being my favorite running appThe perfect appLove the new audio guided runs, but..Reliable running appReally Enjoying ItExcellent running companionBest App on the Market!Lots of Variety7 YEARS STRONG!So much better than Couch to 5k!Let‚Äôs get fit together!Best Fitness AppAbsolutely phenomenal!!FantasticOne minor thingMotivationQualityOnly running app I recommendHuge fan of this app!Really good but need some improvementsBest app for getting race ready or just to stay in shapeTHIS APP WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO RUN MORECompleted 2 half marathons and one full marathonRecommended app!Getting started, once againMade me like RunningMotivated Me to Reach My GoalsGreat App Getting BetterGreat with small complaintsGratefulLove itGet it, you won‚Äôt regret it!Highly RecommendAmazingPerfect for new or experienced runners.Great AppIdeas for improvements foot trafficNew/ Better BeginningGood one.",LAwoman22Slim_480stu.vcameron annejpcatch112FirecrackerRNJakoochieAlex Van TranLindsayOwens3striped415TrollooonElijah Sorensenjstick76JustareyesCaroS946SkeezMachineYoungest FredoCMackSaysJJBeijingtaishapowellMega.megkhi30lisita916peachypaige1219xcinnamonrollseliaszani___.qvest.___AZR00AZR001rox.fox.kenny_151CdatilAlexReese2elidubusSeecoolGuyrunner2895DaniXimetangointxCyd M.

With the new setup, I can no longer see the distance of my past benchmark 3min efforts, entirely defeating the purpose of the benchmark as a method to compare against past performance.

I‚Äôm really frustrated because this app is so close to being helpful but ultimately just disappoints me. I feel like these glitches are things tons of people have flagged and they choose to update the app interface instead of addressing actual concerns. From all the runners on your plans, please please fix the assigning feature so that we can actually finish our training plans on the app like we do in our real lives.The iPhone app has improved from the buggy mess it was at first release... but the Apple Watch app is now slower and more unreliable than ever. If I run with my phone with me, my Apple Watch used to just function as a second display, allowing me to view the stats on my current run. Now, the Watch app frequently freezes for a couple minutes and then ‚Äúforgets‚Äù that it‚Äôs showing me data for a run that my phone is tracking and starts tracking a new run by itself. I end up with two runs logged into the app‚Äî the one logged by the phone is fine, but the run logged by the Watch (despite it never being told to log a run) is all messed up because the Watch missed a long portion of the run while it was frozen. Once again, Nike disappoints with this garbage app. If I didn‚Äôt have so much data saved in it, I would‚Äôve moved on to something better a year ago.I am ticked my running friends use this app to track our runs. The guided runs are good, but every time over the last 2 years i‚Äôve used the coaches runs it disappoints. Literally click start from the run scheduled for the day, complete it and it doesn‚Äôt record the run. it shows in my history, but doesn‚Äôt associat with my plan. When I had my iPhone 6+ thought it was because I had an old phone, the same on my 10. Yes, you can edit a run to add it to your plan but then that run won‚Äôt show on any leaderboards or challenges, because the edit feature allows you to change times and distances too. I use the app to stay connected with distant friends and want ALL my runs to show up. I wish my cheap friends would let us use a paid app that actually works and is supported.",0,Why did the update just make the app more glitchy?Apple Watch app is getting worseBuggy app never fixed Coaching features don‚Äôt track runs,grace k 98kevo0822jvsquared,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,1,1,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,559,has_points,11

Recently though it has not been recording over a mile of my route and it‚Äôs the same route I‚Äôve been doing for awhile. What‚Äôs more is that the mapping tool usually maps my entire run when this happens anyway (sometimes it misses a tiny part or two) yet it says I‚Äôve only gone less than 2 miles. (I turned the automatic pause off several months ago since this function was not compatible with me putting my phone in the stroller I push rather than strapping the phone on my body.) Any tips to fix this?The app continues to under deliver. It periodically fails to start a run, doesn‚Äôt respond, or crashes. I don‚Äôt trust the distances measured as it isn‚Äôt consistent run to run over the same route. Overall Nike could do better.
*****

Latest update was supposed to improve the interface but it in fact is more confusing than before. When you are in the middle of a run there is very little blood left for higher-level thinking so a running app interface needs to be simpler than simple.
This one just doesn't make the cut.
***
The update to the recent app upgrade did fix the most egregious problems so I give Nike points for that. However, the new interface still isn't to my liking.

notes are back (thank you!) and the new design is really nice. I‚Äôve just switched to iPhone X and it was a pleasant surprise that the app is already optimized for it.

With that being said, I turned it on and started running, as always, but as I wasn‚Äôt listening to the feedback I set it up after a few minutes, I checked and as I unlocked my phone, the countdown started again, time was running from when I originally started but the distance was not. I turned it off, took a break and restarted it. Made sure the countdown was over and it was tracking before putting it in my pocket again and a couple of minutes later voila; no feedback. it did the same thing. I really like this app and can‚Äôt wait for it to properly track my runs again! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

Hopefully the massive amounts of poor reviews will have a positive effect on the upcoming updates. I don't think we could be any louder about how disappointing the new app is.

The social media aspect is overwhelming, the badges - which were a big source of motivation for me - were taken away, and the calibration seems off since all of a sudden my pace is way higher than it used to be for no reason. I also miss the Note feature (adding a title to the run sounds a little random/pointless).

I was super excited to do the personalized coach, so I gave it a try for 3 weeks to see how it would go. During that time, I was frustrated by some pretty minor bugs (notifications not disappearing once I had opened them, music stopping and not being able to start back up because the pause button was frozen- little things like that) but even though there were quite a few of them, I decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth stopping for that and tried to be patient with those bugs. However, the weekly schedule (personally) was not customizable for me. If I couldn‚Äôt run on the last day of the scheduled week, that scheduled run didn‚Äôt transfer over to the next week- the schedule continued as though I had run it. Then I got sick for a week and the schedule just continued to move on as though I had been running the whole time. Things like that don‚Äôt motivate me to keep using the app because I feel like by it being *personalized* it should also be a little more customizable to make room for things in life that you don‚Äôt really expect to happen.I like the look of this app and the coachings after a run and the badges make it easier to stay motivated to keep going every day. However, my biggest pet peeve is that it does not keep up with the pace of your run on the treadmill. No matter what I do, I consistenly end up a mere .20 miles behind the what it actually shows me on the treadmill. This is very frustrating as I continue to have to push myself just to meet my goal per day. It's to the point now that I'm going to start having to use Apple's own fitness app to track my runs because I can sync through there to the treadmill to keep up a more accurate pace and then I'll have to just enter my runs manually in the Nike Run Club app üôÑ Definitely more of an inconvenience than I'd like.",0,ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èGet It Together,Evie StormzandTRENTKHR,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,373,has_badges,22

(1) On the Activity tab you can see each run along with the badges you got for that run; this is nice, but when you tap on the run to view more details, those badges don‚Äôt show so you can‚Äôt get more info about those; instead you have to navigate to a different Achievements page. So it would be nice if you could see all the badges associated with the run when you view the details of that run, and then be able to click on the badge to get more info about it. (2) When you get a badge for beating your previous record (like fastest 5k or the longest  run badge) I want to see what my previous record was so that I know how much I improved. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to view this in the app currently; when you get a badge for beating your record and then click the badge, it only shows the new record.

I‚Äôve been using this app off and on since 2016 and I really like it for the most part. However today I was running and paused at the top of the mountain and my watch paused bc I stopped which is normal but then it took it another step and completed the run altogether about 1.69 miles in. So‚Ä¶. I had to start a new run. I ran another 3.5 miles and completed the 5.1 mile loop I wanted to run today. 

Well I wanted to see if I could just edit the length of the 2nd part of the run sun the map image was fine and I wanted to share the run on social media. What I wanted to do was combine the 2 runs  since my watch stopped early on, and make it just 1 total run. But when I edited the run it gave me the pop up of course that the run may not count toward badges since it‚Äôs edit. But then I went to save the run and it wouldn‚Äôt let me save and the the run just vanished from my history altogether.

So now if you look at my history for today you only see the 1.69 miles beginning but not the 3.6 miles second part. My question is where did it go? Snd can I get it back.

Also let‚Äôs say I accidentally delete it instead of saving, I think it would be nice to have a way to undelete if it was an accident. 

That‚Äôs all. 

Just do it‚Ä¶ just fix the app. Do it‚Ä¶ just do it already. 

SwooshThe past 2 weeks, this app has not been working properly. I‚Äôve been using this app for 5 months now. Lately when I‚Äôm 2 miles into my run, the app will suddenly say ‚Äúresuming workout‚Äù!! It‚Äôs not keeping track at all. You can un 5 miles and when you‚Äôre done, you will look at your phone and see that it only recorded you running for 1 mile, if that! I‚Äôve entered my result manually and it doesn‚Äôt update the entered results for the challenges. This is all bad, this app really used to motivate me to get up and out there, it‚Äôs always exciting to see my progress and to get badges for challenges. I need my motivation, this needs to be fixed!!I usually enjoy the Nike App. I love all the features and milestones and badges. It‚Äôs all cute. However, lately the app has not been recording my runs which is very disappointing. I open the app At the beginning of my run and by the end when I‚Äôm trying to end it, it‚Äôs like I never started it in the first place! It just stops the run! If I were hitting stop mistakenly, that‚Äôs on me, sure. But I‚Äôm definitely not, because IF i did it would at least record that little bit before I ‚Äúhit‚Äù stop. Anyway, I‚Äôm switching over to Strava until there‚Äôs an update for this situation. I can‚Äôt take another run not recorded.

I did, and have been on a fitness craze, lost a good amount of weight, and decided for 2022 to set a new goal - run in a race. Starting small - signed up for a local 5K at the end of March, but knew I‚Äôd need to up my running more seriously. My son is a runner and uses Strava and another friend uses the Nike Run App, and others use watches, devices, etc. I do not have an Apple watch and no plans to get one, so I read up on best running apps. For beginners (which I consider myself running wise) the NRC was rated best, hands down. So after downloading it and using it for about six weeks, I can honestly say I love it. I love the tracking mechanisms themselves, the challenges and badges and the guided runs. I feel those have all helped motivate and challenge me - esp monitoring my pace WHILE running because it is easy to slow down and get sluggish (at least for me). Maybe I will outgrow this app one day, as another reviewer mentioned. I would love that because it meant I actually achieved some of the goals I set! Wish me luck on my race!I used NRC to help me train for my 1st half marathon all the way through my 10th half. It has vastly improved over the years and has never let me down. If I accidentally close the app while I‚Äôm running, I just need to reopen it and my run will continue. If I want to share a photo of my run and share my stats on social media, there‚Äôs options of how much I want to share as well as fun stickers to put on my photos. There‚Äôs badges and achievements to earn. It lets me record which shoes I use for each one so I can track how many miles I put on them. There‚Äôs audio guided runs to help anyone run for the first time and how to do recovery runs. I can say I want to do a timed or a distance based run. And sometimes, I just want to run and there‚Äôs an option for that too. Overall, it‚Äôs one of my favorite apps. Thanks Nike for believing in the athlete in all of us.I have been running on and off the past few years, and would be lost without the NRC app. This version of the is the best I‚Äôve experienced so far! I am on the 14 week half marathon plan and it has all of the handholding I need - but the flexibility for people that know how what they‚Äôre doing as well. There are guided runs for every run, each day of each week of the training plan (minus rest days), and I personally love the coaches. With the guided runs, the effort scale and other tools, I‚Äôm starting understand what my effort feels for different paces. Bonus content I love include the milage tracker for my shoes, the additional motivation of the challenge badges, articles for motivation, running, health, and more. It‚Äôs all for free, and it‚Äôs helping me become a better and healthier runner and person.Kudos to the creators of the NRC App. It is easily my favorite. I‚Äôve forever been a fan of the challenges. However, now that I am self training for a marathon I appreciate some of the other features such as the virtual coaching and plans, and the ability to track the mileage of your shoes, when you log your shoes with your run. The achievement badges are really motivational. 

The only con that I see is the community challenges. Sometimes when I join the NIke community challenges, people are logging hundreds/thousands of miles in on the first day. I know those numbers can‚Äôt possibly be correct, so it‚Äôs hard to know we‚Äôre you really rank. 

Over all..... Nike Run Club is awesome!I never write app reviews but this one truly deserves it. Nike has done a great job getting me started and keeping me motivated to run. I started not able to run more than 2 miles without getting tired or bored but the guided runs were great for getting me started. After about 3 months of using the app I am self motivated and running almost every day. The badges and achievements feel great even though they‚Äôre a little cheesy. This app has helped me change my attitude towards running and I‚Äôm so thankful for that. The guided runs were a great starting point and all the coaches are awesome. Make sure to check out ‚ÄúRun for Life‚Äù about Geoff Hollister!Been using this app for three years now and it does not disappoint. It has guided runs where you can be coached and encouraged by Nike officials or runs set at your own pace. So many features in this app, it‚Äôs amazing! Love how it saves all of your activity and you can view achievements levels and badges you complete over time, which definitely keeps you coming back for more üí™üèΩ

10/10 no complaints. Keep making great products Nike! 

(Nike ZoomX vaporfly = the best running shoe out there to be paired w the app)I can‚Äôt believe there was not an Achievement badge when I ran on Christmas. Really Nike?

Gamification is pushing people to run when they normally don‚Äôt.  Listen my suggestion give a badge for all Holidays especially big ones like running on Christmas, next give city badges for running in different places. I would like to see achievement badges for running in certain states or big cities.  Atlanta, NY, Chicago and LA just to name a few.  Come on. Perhaps also special award or are when you‚Äôre running in an organized Marathon or half Marathon. 

Otherwise I love the app very much.I lost a lot weight. Among my exercise routine is running. I always hated running. However, running is a great way to lose weight and keep it off. My daughter introduced me to Nike Run Club. It is amazing. I use the guided runs often. I feel like I have my own personal coaching team. The app also keeps track of how many miles I put on my running shoes. It offers achievement badges which I try to collect. I work all the time. With this app I feel like I am participating in a sport...and I am. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.Honestly, I‚Äôve never been able to run more than 10 seconds without being out of breath. I started using this app for walks, and then started jogging a bit during my walks to get my time down. It‚Äòs super convenient that the app tracks my distance, calories, pace, elevation, etc and allows me to compete with myself to go further and faster! The achievement badges always make me smile and so do the encouraging messages from the trainers after my run. Super great app for anyone who‚Äôs a beginner like myself!I never write reviews, but I wanted to say thanks for helping me get back in shape.  I wish that running alone was incentive enough, but being able to accept challenges, earn badges, and look at my historical progress as I increase in distance and speed.  Thanks for that.  I appreciate being engaged as a customer ‚Äî Nike genuinely does a great job at that.  I can say that I am so much healthier after using this app for the past several months, and the motivation provided has truly helped me.  Thanks again!I‚Äôve been using Nike Run Club for over a decade. I‚Äôve tried several other apps in the process, enjoyed a few of the others as well. But for dependability, and for long term tracking I love Nike. My runs get recorded and you get ‚Äúbadges‚Äù for running certain miles and on certain days. It has different levels that you strive for and in my lifetime I plan to achieve them all. Love Nike Run Club & I immediately recommend it to new runners.This app has been a godsend for my fitness. I hated running, like everyone,but the  guided runs make it much more fun. Not everything is an all out sprint. Adaptable plans to get you where you ant to be, the ability to add friends, using your own playlist, and the multiple awards and challenges you can receive and accept.

Since then pretty much every app developer has learned that since there is no physical feedback on a glass screen, you have to provide some indication to the user that the button he is trying to press was in fact pressed.

The developer of this i watch app apparently have no experience developing touch apps since no button gives any feedback. This is exacerbated by the slowness of the app. For example: when pressing 'Start' to begin a workout. It takes several seconds to actually start. In the mean while the user is left to wonder, ""Did I press it?"". The same happens when stopping a workout.

My second gripe is that you cannot stop a workout  using the physical buttons on the iWatch. After running 10km, most people are pretty sweaty and trying to use a touch interface with sweaty fingers and an unresponsive UI is just frustrating.Like the app. But every day an update? Really? Then I have to wait for the Watch to update before a run. Everyday. Sometimes twice in the same day. Everyday. Ad nauseum. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Latest - after an app update since my last post the continuous updating stopped. Now issues have cranked up again. Lost runs. The app stops in the middle of a run then takes forever starting again. It also takes minutes to launch before starting a run. I look forward to my running but this adds a layer of frustration to it before I ever get started. Getting worse. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Today stuck at .12 miles and never moved again. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd give it a minus 1 if I could. Captured run then restarted over and over. I don‚Äôt feel like jumping through hoops just to get this app to work.Current problems: audio from external apps broken, distances inaccurate, mapped splits wildly off, hey Siri integration from lock screen fails, not possible to export data. 

AUDIO:  If you listen to podcasts or anything external to the app, beware.  Latest update hoses audio.  ‚ÄúBeginning workout‚Äùnot heard.  At first feedback announcement, your volume will be lowered but no feedback, and it is not restored.  Play/pause does not help, sometimes even triggering the app to pause your run. Sometimes exiting the Nike app and going to the app playing audio to pause it can help Run+ right itself but not reliably.

DISTANCES:  Last two revisions have been wildly inconsistent with distance reporting.  Even with strong GPS, same run on measured course varies over 10% run to run.

MAP SPLITS:  tracing your route on the map reveals the impossible.  For an out and back run, halfway point never matches the turnaround spot, off by as much as a mile for a 6 mike run. 

HEY SIRI:  ‚ÄúHey Siri begin ( or end, pause, resume) run with Nike+ run Club‚Äù only works with phone unlocked and app open.  From lock screen, it will tell you it is starting or pausing or resuming, but nothing happens. 
 
DATA LOCKED: Your run data cannot be exported.Ever since the latest update 09/17 have constant issues with the app on iwatch series 2. If you don‚Äôt wait for the countdown to finish at startup then the app will lock and act like you never ran. Voice feedback is so slow it now sounds like the sloths from Zootopia. So every time I run now I am constantly checking to see if it started, having to reset it at the beginning of a run, or just checking it 10 times as much because I am convinced it doesn‚Äôt read right or froze up again.  Additionally the app will not log the mile marks on the phone when uploaded from the watch. The data looks good, just the over view map will be skewed. Also your monthly miles ran log will not update on the watch for sometimes days. When it works it is great, just doesn‚Äôt work often.Have been a user for years; however the new update has removed basic functions that make this app no longer usable as a runner. It tells me how many meters I have run, regardless if I have settings on imperial or metric. It never rolls over into mikes nor km either, once set. This is simply not helpful info as a long-distance runner. I‚Äôm not running in short spurts where meters alone is relevant. You also can‚Äôt set the feedback to let you know when you‚Äôve reached a half mile or km:  again, not helpful nor user friendly.

I cant see anyone else‚Äôs runs and there is no option to communicate via text with anyone.   I cant play pandora music while i run and quite frankly this priduct has far less capabilities than apple plus runs or map my run.   I‚Äôm certain i‚Äôm missing something from a highly rated app.   I got this for a work challenge but i‚Äôm not going to keep it if this is all there is.  i joined a new runner program but i dont get credit for any runs outside the program but still withon the app and if i were to do a guided run and want to run longer for my challenge group there is no mechanism to turn on other music and so i‚Äôm running quietly.   Also the interaction with my javra headphones is such that i can answer calls but i cant hear anyone and they cant hear me so they hang up.    This is not good if you take call for work.   
Overall disappointed.  the running plans are a nice idea that I like and would like to have as the coaching is good but i‚Äôm not getting any feedback during like i would with apple fitness plus.I love the guided workouts, but the app is very glitchy and sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work at all. You can hit the start button on the Apple Watch and nothing happens forcing you to just use something else. If you go unguided, the voice will tell you that you started, but won‚Äôt alert you to move to other segments. Most of the time it just runs straight through the warm up and keeps you on segment one.  
There are too few metrics, which should be easy to pull off the watch, but they just don‚Äôt exist and the data screens while running are very basic and limited. It will tell you pace, cadence, distance and heart rate but there no maps, power, heart rate zones or anything else. 
I was excited to use this again, but it just doesn‚Äôt work well for me. I used to use it all the time, but something has gone wrong. I would love some feedback from a developer if I am doing something wrong, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case.I‚Äôve had so many problems with this app its to the point I cannot use it anymore. I liked the audio cues, I liked the guided runs, I liked the training plans. I hate the glitches and I‚Äôve run into so many! I started a training plan to get myself back into running. Loved the training plan but then it stopped recording my runs in the training plans even though that‚Äôs where I started them. I have the Nike S2 Apple Watch and it started recording ‚Äúphantom runs‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt start and would interrupt my actual runs. The Apple Watch is not recording my heart rate during my runs on the app either. I‚Äôve talked to support on the phone twice and both times they dropped my calls and never called me back. I got help once only after the app asked me to send feedback. I‚Äôm not asking a lot out of this app for my needs and they‚Äôre not being met. If all you need are the most basic things like gps distance then you‚Äôll love this app.updating review from 1y ago:

notes are back (thank you!) and the new design is really nice. I‚Äôve just switched to iPhone X and it was a pleasant surprise that the app is already optimized for it.

With that being said, I turned it on and started running, as always, but as I wasn‚Äôt listening to the feedback I set it up after a few minutes, I checked and as I unlocked my phone, the countdown started again, time was running from when I originally started but the distance was not. I turned it off, took a break and restarted it. Made sure the countdown was over and it was tracking before putting it in my pocket again and a couple of minutes later voila; no feedback. it did the same thing. I really like this app and can‚Äôt wait for it to properly track my runs again! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

Hopefully the massive amounts of poor reviews will have a positive effect on the upcoming updates. I don't think we could be any louder about how disappointing the new app is.

The social media aspect is overwhelming, the badges - which were a big source of motivation for me - were taken away, and the calibration seems off since all of a sudden my pace is way higher than it used to be for no reason. I also miss the Note feature (adding a title to the run sounds a little random/pointless). 
I would love to have more of the old app back, less Instagram-ish please.Used to be a great app, but no longer. 

App doesn‚Äôt tag a run as a plan workouts automatically like before. No idea if this is intentional or not, but now one must manually designate a run was a plan workout after the fact, or the workout is listed as incomplete. Oftentimes these manual edits still won‚Äôt save and you have to re-enter your information multiple times before it finally saves.

 Feedback entered after workouts (run difficulty on the 1-10 scale, other info you can add) doesn‚Äôt log either, so when manually editing runs like above, info needs to be re-entered a second time, if not more.

No rest timer on sprint/interval workouts, and multiple button presses are needed to pause timer on a split /end lap. Previous versions, you hit the pause button and rest timer automatically started. Hit the button again to start next split. Simple and elegant. This process is now complicated and unintuitive.

GPS tracking is fairly inconsistent. Running the exact same one mile route will give different distances every time, sometimes overestimating, sometimes underestimating it but as much as .15 of a mile.

This app was great two or three versions ago, now it‚Äôs bloated, overly complex, and unreliableAfter having used this app for four weeks, I am definitely disappointed.  It‚Äôs OK for just tracking regular runs - but the app bills itself as a training or coaching app.  The ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù plan seems cool, and throws a variety of runs at you, but good luck getting them to register as ‚Äúdone‚Äù in your plan.  You also can‚Äôt start the next run in your plan from your watch, so forget leaving your phone at home.  ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù interval runs don‚Äôt even mirror to the watch, which wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world except that there is NO voice feedback for when to rest or resume on these runs.  So if none of these things work reliably, what‚Äôs the point of using this app over any of the numerous other running apps?Since I‚Äôve been running with my series 3 watch this year, the Nike + Run Club app have crashed multiple times and called to save my run. This usually doesn‚Äôt happen on my short workouts but instead the long ones, which honestly makes it even more frustrating. The only feedback I‚Äôve gotten from Nike is to not start the run on my watch, but on my phone instead, which I can do, but it‚Äôs just like a workaround. I couldn‚Äôt find an email address to send feedback directly so I‚Äôm leaving my feedback here. I‚Äôve used this app for years, logged over 1,000 miles and I thought it would be even better when I added the watch to the mix, however I just made it unstable.Start run fails to start a lot, please include haptic feedback with the main START button. The main feature in the app works the worst. The rest of the app works as intended. Although, I have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to get the Apple Watch miles identifier to sync up correctly with the actual miles that have been logged in the app. I‚Äôm constantly deleting the application off the Apple Watch and putting it back on, just for it to sync up and show the correct mileage. It kind of takes the motivation away when you look at your watch and it only shows you‚Äôve ran 12 miles this month, when it all actuality he ran over 30.I think I hate this app so much because I want to love it so much. My 1/2 marathon plan seems well thought out, the feedback is motivating, and I like the ease of use...during a run. But after the run, after you‚Äôve run till you drop, left everything out on the road, and the NRC app won‚Äôt apply your run to your workout, you die a little inside. That big empty circle next to your workout is like a hole in the middle of your soul. There‚Äôs a completed run in your Activity page, but your plan shows zip, nada, zilch. And there‚Äôs nothing you can do but stare into the sweaty abyss of your running shoes and cry. ‚ÄúIs it because they‚Äôre Brooks shoes? Is that why you forsake me, NRC?‚ÄùThe main reason I use this app is to get mileage feedbacks by voice, but it‚Äôs unreliable for that lately. It‚Äôs either losing track of my run and can‚Äôt tell how far I‚Äôve run or the volume keeps resetting to mute in the middle of my run. I know it‚Äôs losing track of me because I see my run chart and even though I ran a loop, I only see half of the loop. About 1/3 to 1/2 of my run is missing regularly. I know it‚Äôs not my iPhone‚Äôs fault because my Fitbit doesn‚Äôt have the same problem. On top of all of this, it‚Äôs confusing to use. Sometimes it takes me several tries to get to the spot where I can start my run.This app has many useful features, but on the whole it's annoying. By default it has sounds and feedback turned on, with the result that it chatters incessantly. Unlike every other sports app I've used, it's always on and there's no way to turn it off except to force close it.
I finally figured out how to turn off the feedback voices by going to the Settings page. Fortunately, I know all the different ways that app developers hide things that they shouldn't hide. A novice user would be stuck. Online help is non-existent, and I feel sad for the admins who have to continually monitor Twitter to answer questions.",0,"we must be using different appsNot GreatGood for casual short distances only:(They fixed it until it was brokenUnreliable, especially with the watchFrustrating on Watch - Long Runs LostMiles on Watch App OffI hate it because I want to love itBuggy, loses parts of runs, hard to useHighly annoying app",Free Clinic DocXtucannsammRobynm8interplanetaireFeign Amnesialat3ralus65worshipwannabeDave G.

Wanted to write up some feedback in hopes that this app will improve. I wanted to say that one of the toughest things to do within the app is finding ways to connect and run with your friends. Strava does really great in this to where you can see the feed of your friends runs! I can‚Äôt even figure out how to reconnect my Facebook, Instagram or contacts within this app. I see my friends sharing their runs on social media sometimes, but there is no way I can find them within the Nike Run app. The run community is a huge collective of people doing the same thing together, running. So, my wish is that it were easier to connect with my fellow runners within my social circle - whether it be through Facebook, Instagram, Google, contact info, or whatever else. Everything else is great. I love the workout plans, marathon training, and everything else. This is what makes the app great. But, the lack of social connection really brings the app down for me, and I‚Äôm sure a lot of others. I wish you all the best!I have been using NRC for four years, since Nike Plus days. I love the design, the feedback and achievements, the community features, integration with music. And unlike most other apps, it never bugs you about upgrading to premium version.
But after 500 runs, it reached a point of being unusable. The startup takes several minutes on an iPhone SE. Countdown to run stops at ‚Äú1‚Äù and stays there for up to a minute before tracking starts. Many updates bring bugs like music muting when the run starts, forcing restart of the Music app, etc. The web site version was always very slow, but now the community features like heat maps seem to be disappearing.
I have moved my runs to Strava (exporting runs from Nike is a challenge in itself!), which is extremely responsive in comparison. Going back through run history is a snap, and tracking starts instantly. Yes, the feedback is missing, unless you pay an annual fee. But at least I start each run in a better mood.I went back to NRC after using MapMyRun because I can access my plan through my Apple Watch and get all my heart rate data to sync and I don‚Äôt necessarily need to bring my phone with me then. I also liked the plans better.

However, it frequently takes forever to sync the runs with my phone, or the run disappears altogether.  Imagine my disappointment when I went to look through the stats on my 6.2 mile run, first I‚Äôve done in 2 years, and it somehow vanished.  And I know I did all the things to complete it because I had tried to get it to sync in my car before I drove home.  

I also can‚Äôt get the feedback to sync with headphones during the run.  It will sync my music but the milestone announcements, and if I try to do a guided run, will only go through the watch if I start the run on my watch.  I don‚Äôt need everyone on the trail to get a guided run or hear my stats!haven‚Äôt been very satisfied with updates to the app since the introduction of iOS 11. it is buggy and loads much slower. notifications are also not working quite right. in addition, i‚Äôve already tried giving feedback and contacting customer support via twitter about the new ‚Äúcheers‚Äù feature. while i don‚Äôt have a desire to use it, i can see that plenty of people would and that‚Äôs fine. I would just like the ability to disable receiving notifications from the app requesting i give friends cheers when they finish a run without disabling ALL app notifications. customer support would not answer me if or how this is possible and told me if i wanted further assistance i would have to call the phone line. i have not done that because that seems ridiculous. please allow specification to which notifications to receive.The coaching took is great overall but I was very disappointed by the speed run. The run could have a goal of 400m with 1m 30s rest periods but to my surprise their is no feedback when you hit the prescribed distance. When going on longer runs the app will announce miles and if your halfway to your goal. Speed runs should be similar. It is a pain to have to keep looking at my phone or watch for distance. Then having to hit lap for the rest period and lap for the next interval. It‚Äôs very cumbersome and seems like something that could easily be fixed. 

Add a voice announcement for hitting the goal distance, an automatic timer for the rest period, and an announcement to start the next interval. Simple but would make those workouts so much better and boost this app to 5 stars in my opinion.I‚Äôm a loyal Nike Fan and for the most part I like the app. 

When using the app on my Apple Watch, long runs tend to take a while to sync with the app on my phone, it has happened a few times to where I end my run, the app lags, closes, and I then lose my run. If using the app on my phone I normally don‚Äôt have these issues, but it‚Äôs annoying looking at my phone while running, trying to keep pace. Along with that, if I start the run on my app and open the app on my watch, the two don‚Äôt sync together. Often times if I‚Äôm scared my run won‚Äôt sync and don‚Äôt want to deal with the headache of unlocking my phone to check pace, I start a run on both the app and the watch and just delete one of the runs when I‚Äôm done. 

Entering manual runs when runs don‚Äôt sync, it doesn‚Äôt count towards your weekly runs or challenges which is a bummer as well. 

I wish you can also compete with your previous run and get feedback if you‚Äôre ahead of pace or behind pace, but this feature has still not been available after multiple request. 

The app has a lot of potential for sure and I love it when it works but I hope they can figure out something with the syncing issues.I love my Nike shoes and I‚Äôm unable to run with any other brand.  I‚Äôve used this Nike app since I started recording my runs.  But... I‚Äôm very disappointed in Nike for associating any of its products with such horrible people who kneel during our Country‚Äôs National Anthem, disrespecting all of the true heroes who died for our freedom just so they can show their hatred towards law enforcement and continue helping racism show its ugly head.  So many people I know have stopped using your products because of this very bad decision your company have made.  I run a lot and am continuously looking for a replacement running shoe.  And as soon as I can figure out how to transfer all of my run data over to a different run app, there‚Äôs a strong chance I‚Äôll be doing so.

Sincerely,

Very DisappointedI use this app every single time I go running, whether it is outside or on a treadmill. I love it, as I can measure my strength and improve my speed with the voice feedbacks during my runs. When using it outside it works perfectly, however on a treadmill there are consistent problems. The app does not measure the time accurately, I consistently get 10 extra seconds per km, which I had realized as the treadmill indicates the right times. Even when I put the treadmill on a faster speed, the app still does not measure the changed time. Please develop the technology/mechanics to ensure that the app is able to measure more accurately the speed of the runner, as this way we get inaccurate results and are not able to measure our strength. Thank you!I‚Äôve had this app for a years. Some things have gotten better and some have gotten worse. Yesterday it said I‚Äôve run 533 miles and today I ran 4 more miles and now it says I‚Äôve run 531.9 miles. Pretty frustrating. I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs been stuck somewhere around 500 for the past year and I am thinking some of my runs haven‚Äôt synced. Anyway other than that annoyance, I love keeping track of my runs and I love the positive feedback. I do like the stickers which are relatively new for the sharing feature, however there isn‚Äôt a place inter location to pick ‚Äúbeach run‚Äù anymore. I love by the beach so I run there all the time. Not sure why it was removed. All in all a decent app and I‚Äôll continue to use it!The NRC+ app and Apple Watch app companion do a sufficient job as run trackers. Both are buggy and crash often. There is somewhat of a delay in sync between the two and the Watch companion is missing some key functionality. I would like to be able to see my running plan on Apple Watch and cue the plan from the onset of the run, rather than doing it on the backend. Also, plans dictate audio guided runs not available on the companion selection...like benchmark runs. Lack of intuitive utility and smart features combined with frequent crashes and bugs makes this app good...not great. But, it‚Äôs good enough that I‚Äôll keep using it...hoping for improvements based on consumer feedback.Have been using for roughly 8 years. Nike has had some BRUTAL releases over the years, where the app seemingly goes backward in functionality. Nike has routinely dropped features from prior versions, and I‚Äôve given enough feedback over the years to determine Nike doesn‚Äôt really factor feedback (from all customers, not just me) into their product roadmap. Stopped using the Nike Apple Watch version simply because the GPS tracking was horrible, and syncing with Apple AirPods was glitchy. Didn‚Äôt mean for this to be so negative...... the current version app is decent and gets the job done. Despite release notes, cadence tracking not enabled.For a running app it has the basics. Not sure how accurate the GPS is on the Apple Watch when I go jogging with my jogger stroller. I don‚Äôt think the mileage is very accurate and that may be because I‚Äôm pushing my stroller half the time with my watch arm. I‚Äôll have to compare it to when I run the same route without the baby but that would be my feedback, whether there is a way to better calculate the workout with a stroller. Otherwise I enjoy the breakdown of my splits and the elevation gained. Don‚Äôt really like the auto pause since it‚Äôs too wacky and stops and starts a lot when I‚Äôm running... again this is worse with a stroller.",0,"Let‚Äôs connect!Great app for casual runs, problematic for long-time useMixed performancebuggy and frustrating!Speed Runs need Auto-DetectionA love hate relationship.DisrespectImprove the technologyIt won‚Äôt count my miles, but it‚Äôs decentGood...not greatHighs and LowsJogger mom",ElPeytonBlancoMr. CogitoSld32ehrdydocdelloBrose8695BABEMissBuenobeachyrunnerMarc LositoJackieboy_98JoggerMom33,"{'id': 1677882, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThanks for your feedback.

Still a good app but I the distance calculations has been off quite a bit. I haven‚Äôt been shorted a mile on multiple runs. The app is tracking the distance but not calculating correctly, shorting me on my goals through the app.  Please fix. 
I have completed a 10K run thanks to this app and would and do recommend it to people. 

Updated 2/1 I‚Äôve began to follow a running plan.   Having an actual plan/coach on this app would be great vs. having to follow a PDF then find the correlating run. Also, the app has continuously crashed on me during my indoor runs. It‚Äôs not logging any of my runs when done inside. This is becoming very frustrating. I've enjoyed this app thoroughly. Ive recently started running again after multiple years of surgeries and injuries. have passed milestones for myself with this app! I've even considered trying a 10k. So thank you. Unfortunately there have been a few occasions when I've been running on the treadmill that the app crahses and doesn't log my run, which is really frustrating and unmotivating. Minus that the coaches are great and I like the different options to mix things up. If the glitches and not logging could be fixed this would be perfect.I love that this app keeps me accountable, motivates me and gives me a schedule tailored to my progress. I was initially very impressed with the audio feedback with the benchmark runs, and I looked forward to that feedback when doing sprint reps. It was disappointed when I began my first rep sprint but there was no feedback. I was so confused on how to use the lap timer. After running the first lap and walking during the ‚Äúrest‚Äù time I thought to myself, ‚Äúhold on what is this timer icon?‚Äù I tapped it and then realized that this button was what counted my reps. So long story short my average time for this run was all off and ultimately defeated the purpose of the app tailoring my runs to my progress. This aspect of the UI could be improved to either describe the expectation of how to use the timer icon for reps OR even better add audio feedback to the progress so you know when to run and rest instead of having to hold and look at your phone.I love using the Nike Run Club app to keep track of my runs and share stats with my friends and I really enjoy the guided runs with a coach feedback. However, I would give this 5 stars if there was better synchronization with the Apple Watch app. When I start a run on my phone, I‚Äôd like to be able to control the settings of that same run (e.g. start/pause/stop) on my Apple Watch. Instead, when I start a run on my phone, the Watch doesn‚Äôt recognize that I‚Äôve started a run on my phone and will ask me to start a new run on my watch while I‚Äôve started one on my phone. I know some Apple Watch users don‚Äôt bring their phone AND watch with them on runs, but I like bringing both in case I want to take photo on my run or just for the convenience of having both on me. Any update to fix this would be great!Great app, I use it whenever I‚Äôve run, and I‚Äôve used it for almost a year now‚Äîso I really like it and i think it does a fantastic job, especially considering all the great features (shoe tracking, achievements, challenges, autopause, audio feedback, and more), but it has some serious problems.

Problems: General sluggishness. It often takes a bit to start up the run and will occasionally randomly pause and not start up until you do it manually. The big one is it glitches out and DOES NOT TRACK your whole run. I run the same route through Central Park everyday so I know about how far I‚Äôm running and it‚Äôs very frustrating when it only tracks 2 miles for the 7 miles I ran. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to hit goals and get accurate readings.

Some improvements: An option so whenever I auto pause I can hear the audio feedback about distance. The ability to have audio feedback tell me the time of day as well as the rest. Update the weird share feature to something more useful. I don‚Äôt know maybe modest Nike discounts for hitting certain milestones.

I never write reviews but I‚Äôm writing this one because I love this app, use it everyday, and want it to get better! Thanks Nike! :) #checksoverstripesI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but sometimes when I press START so that I can start running, and then I turn it off when I begin to run. I run an average of 4.5-5 miles a day (with rest days of course) and I set it to tell me feedback every mile split. Anyways, when I turn it off, after a while I don‚Äôt get any feedback so I turn on my phone and see what the holdup is, I then see that the app has crashed in the middle of my run. I go back into the app hoping to see that it‚Äôs still timing and tracking the distance I‚Äôve ran. Only to see that it hasn‚Äôt tracked a single thing, but then it starts up again as soon as I go into the app but it says that it‚Äôs just starting to time me. PLZ FIXED THIS STUPID GLITCH ASAP. THIS APP IS GREAT OTHER THAN THAT ONE STUPID STUPID GLITCH!!I really like the Nike+ Run app. I especially like the My Coach feature with the training plans. BUT...

On the Watch: Nike claims that you get the full experience on the Apple Watch. This is not quite true. Frustratingly, My Coach doesn‚Äôt work or show up on the watch. It doesn‚Äôt sync the current day‚Äôs run. 

On the whole:

Additionally, Nike+ Run doesn‚Äôt cause the watch to capture continuous heart rate whether the run is started on the watch or the phone. So when you look at the run in the Workouts app there is no heart rate chart. 

Also, there are runs in the My Coach plan that are a series of runs with a real between. The app doesn‚Äôt give you audio cues or tell you when you‚Äôve reached the distance. It also has no way to account for the rest periods. So you either have a slower time recorded for one run or you have to track multiple runs. Then you can only assign one run to the training plan.I switched to this from another running app because the Watch app supports voice feedback and overall is better. When it works. I play music from the Watch over Bluetooth and it‚Äôs clear that running the Nike app at the same time pushes my S2 to the limit. As a result, the app is sluggish crashes when I save a run almost every time. Half of those are recoverable, half are not. I don‚Äôt know if this is due to the recent update or not, but I‚Äôm going to have to go back to my old app.The app for the phone is the perfect run partner. I use the guided runs which give me feedback as I am running so that I can reach my goals. 
The only downside is that I bought the Apple Watch Nike edition and expected it to work great. It does not meet my expectations. The run data does not show on the watch when you start from the phone.

I like the My Coach feature a lot but I don‚Äôt like how strict the weekly plans are. By that I mean they aren‚Äôt as adjustable as I‚Äôd like. Yes, you can move workouts around in one week, but there is no going back or jumping ahead between weeks. For example, I had four workouts in a week and I wanted to do one run on a Monday, it was the last workout for that week, but now I can‚Äôt access the run. I could just do the run myself but I enjoy the guided runs telling me what to do. Also, this isn‚Äôt a continuous run, it‚Äôs 400 splits that you run and rest. Runs like that track weird in regular modes. I would really like to be able to move the workouts in between weeks. Have access to adjust the whole schedule, not just one week at a time. At least be able to add workouts from the past/move ones I didn‚Äôt do into my current week.A nice run tracker with a generally slick interface and innovative training features. The particular benefits of this app include the audio guidance and encouragement on training runs as well as a flexible My Coach feature that will design a race training plan for you and adapt to your performance. This app also integrates well with Garmin Connect. 

The interface has small hiccups. Some achievements are continually marked as new even after being viewed (i.e. farthest run), inbox messages disappear or don‚Äôt appear right after getting a notification that they‚Äôre there, and training plans will sometimes disappear entirely (just close and reopen app to fix). 

There is also room for improvement. I would love to see better feedback on performance relative to a training plan. The weekly summaries contain no performance insights, and adaptions to the training plan are made without ever saying why.I‚Äôve just started the run coaching aspect of this app and I‚Äôm really enjoying it!  I like the constant coach feedback during the run to push you through and update you where you‚Äôre at in your run without having to pull the phone out of your pocket.

Not having an option to email tech support is a bit annoying..  I noticed the coaching run wasn‚Äôt displaying any metrics or anything on the watch. I can‚Äôt start my coaches runs from the watch either.  One of my biggest gripes is running with music and the music audio decreases when the coach starts speaking and never returns to the original listening volume after the coach is done talking.  This forces me to continually raise my volume which then has the coach yelling in my ears...This app is what helped me start running on 2012, and it‚Äôs what helped me get back into it in 2021. There are myriad guided runs, which are awesome at helping build your endurance mindset and get into the zone. 

My one and only complaint is that the app bugs for me‚Äîa lot‚Äîwhen it comes to updating my runs from my watch to my phone, or when a monthly challenge ends. Sometimes, even after my new run shows up, the app will continuously crash when I try to view the new run stats. 

If it weren‚Äôt for these bugs, the app experience would be perfect. I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll continue to update and debug the app!I really have enjoyed this app for my marathon training: the workouts are well-paced and not repetitive. Especially compared to the training apps that require a subscription, this is a great free alternative. My one piece of feedback is that the guided run commentary can be a LOT. Like, commentary every 10-20 seconds. This can be great for certain workouts, but others I find it too distracting and it cuts off any music tempo you might be following. It would be great if there was a way to switch from a guided run to a non-guided program without having to stop the whole run.The Nike app does a good job of tracking run information like distance, speed, and elevation. It is nice to have it sync with the Apple Watch as well. I would like it if the mileage feedback was a more dynamic. For instance on my first mile it could give me audio details at quarter mile increments so I knew if I was on track for my personal best. Quarter mile feedback would be great on the last mile as well. The last quarter mile would be nice to hear tenth mile feedback. If there were more feedback options in the menu like this that would be better.This app has a pile of great features and an awesome interface. I love that they have a ton of speedwork runs for different levels and coaching feedback. That said..... some of the mid-workout feedback voiceovers just won‚Äôt shut up. During a 2 min interval, I‚Äôll get 20 seconds of my music and 1:40 of a voice assistant cracking jokes. I wish there was a reduced voice coach, as far as I can tell its either on or off with no middle ground. Love the idea though, and I‚Äôll muscle through for the sake of the workout!",0,"My Coach FeatureSolid Run Tracker, CoachAdd in-app email support!Great motivator, awesome guided runs, a little buggyGreat for training, but the guided runs can be a bit muchDoes a good job of tracking runsAwesome speed workouts, babbling voice feedback",Ha?!Bad_Wolf_23Internexus.Meummm...music?kkp308XO Man of WarDjizzile the dj,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,900,has_feedback,57

You can fix this mess without the need to throw away your new work.

By now, with old the negative feedback to the latest version, you should understand that the Coach section is the problem.

We earthlings don't have answers to questions like how many miles we want to run or opportunities to exercise per week we have. 

Therefore the solution is very simple:

1) Within Coach, create ""Earthlings"" and ""Pros"" sections
2) In ""Pros"", throw in all the new development for Coach. We get it: there are gals and guys that clearly  want those options.
3) In ""Earthlings"", bring back the old Coach. No more, no less.

Is that simple. 

Please, DO NOT try to combine options of the new with the old Coach.

In the future, for the ""Earthlings"" section, you may add 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, all the way to 100K programs. 

If you have any question, feel free to reach out...I‚Äôm thinking of leaving ASAP because I can‚Äôt figure out how to get it tell me how fast my last mile was, I need to know what I‚Äôm doing mile per mile, please help!!!

Pros: I‚Äôm notified thru my AirPods Pro my pace, distance etc at each mile and at the end of my run. The achievement awards help me stayed motivated. You can enter different contests with thousands of others. I can track how many miles I‚Äôve ran in my shoes‚Ä¶so I know when it‚Äôs time for a new pair. I haven‚Äôt used the guided runs yet because I listen to my music but there are different coaches who give me positive feedback at the end of my runs. I can see every detail about each run from elevation to heart rate and my time per mile. It even shows a map of where I ran. 
Cons: I can‚Äôt look at my Apple Watch series 4 & see my distance or pace so I have to use my Apple Watch workout app at the same time so I can see those stats. It doesn‚Äôt default my running shoe each run so I have to remember to put it in manually. 
Overall it‚Äôs my favorite free running app.I remember asking my friend which app I should use for my runs, and they suggested the Nike Rune App; And I am totally being honest my good mates, The Nike Run App is a üòö from the running gods my good mates. 

The app keeps me motivated, and it tells me what to do so I don‚Äôt mess up during my run. The app has an achievements section which makes running fun and feel less like a hassle, there is also a news feed that features all things running including tips, stories, motivational pieces and more. There is a challenges and events section where you can run with your friends or by yourself, this makes the app feel like a community. The running levels section is like a tier system, and it is based off of miles ran.

The app pauses your time when you are resting, and it tracks your elevation, average pacing, calories burnt, miles ran, time, and your beats per minute. You can edit the speed, distance, and time of your runs so you can challenge yourself, you can even mark laps around your course for your runs! The audio feedback feature can be edited to give your more- or - less feedback, and if you really don‚Äôt know what you are doing, there are courses under the My Coach sections which last from 4-8 weeks, and there are guided runs for some fun.

My overall verdict on the Nike Run Club app is a solid 10/10, a üòö from the running gods.Last spring was my first year on my high school track team and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. Being surrounded by motivational friends and learning to be more health conscious is something I‚Äôll be able to cherish forever. This summer it was initially difficult to keep the same routine and rhythm for running. This app changed the game. Pairing my Apple Watch with NRC and downloading Guided Runs has helped me continuously better myself in the off-season. Every time I run, Coach Chris Bennett is with me every step of the way, telling me time and time again that I‚Äôm a better runner than the runner who started the run. And it‚Äôs true. And it‚Äôs thanks to Nike Run Club.I have used the NRC app for multiple years and now have 14,000 miles plus on the app. It is the one app that meets my needs, in that I actually walk rather than run and from time to time I stop for a couple of minutes, to talk with friends, and then move onto additional walking exercise.  This is the one app that I‚Äôve found that doesn‚Äôt penalize my walking rate because of the stop time. The app gives me real time feedback as well as summary info related to pace rate, heart rate and elevation changes. Finally the app does all of this without killing the battery time in the device I use for the app.The is the best running App in the universe. The guided runs are extremely helpful and super motivating. Big shout out to my favorite running guide, Coach Bennet. Huge fan of running with headspace as well. 

Constructive feedback:

I dont think the achievements for streaks is running. Also i just don‚Äôt understand how the streaks work. Adding a short description about what the runner had to do to achieve the streak would be helpful for bragging and motivating or a combination thereof. E.g how many time a week does one have to run to keep the weekly streak going? Similarly how many days out of the month does one have to run to continue the streaks?I grew up playing a bunch of sports and now that I‚Äôm an adult I needed to have some sort of competition feel. Nike Running Club gives me that - let‚Äôs me choose a goal and helps me to improve over time. The feedback (which you can adjust to your preference) updates me to my mile times which gives me a point of reference for the next time. Personally, I also enjoy using the coaches to give me encouragement on my run. I would highly recommend moving forward for anyone who just likes to be active!The newest update does crash a lot and the my coach feature doesn‚Äôt translate easily to watch, but i still love the functionality and user interface.  I have been using this app since 2008 and through all the different iterations of the app you guys have always listened to customer feedback and have brought features back.  Please get MY COACH to work from watch, guided runs are good starting point, but need MY COACH.  The watch app has been very buggy, crashing a lot and need updating...I haven‚Äôt loved a running app since 2014. Anyone else use Gipis? Gipis taught me to love running by telling me to slow down when I was running too fast, and by building and adjusting my running plan, dynamically, throughout my training. I went from hating it, to desiring it. The Nike running club app is the closest thing I have found since that app disappeared. I do wish there was more real-time feedback on pace with the app, but the plans are user focused and helpful I‚Äôm happy again and pushing myself to seal peak fitness. üôèüèºI really appreciate this app. The way you can compare how your weekly runs are with your friends. The coaches are inspirational, and they provide helpful feedback in improving my run. 

Nothing really to comment on improvement- I sometimes have a bit of glitches if I am listening to music and a guided run, where either the music or the guided run will be low no matter what the volume is or even if I turn off the other. But that‚Äôs not really the end of the world.",0,Best FREE running appAbsolutely Perfect.Nike Run Club paves the way to successNRC is a fantastic appBest Running App But needs some tweakingKeeps Me Motivated and CompetitiveLove the app but need MY COACH to work on Watch AppGreat app for running plansGreat app. Motivating.

Unfortunately though, the Watch version of this app is terrible. It takes 2-4 minutes for the app to load on my watch each time I open it (I get that annoying blinking yellow dot while it loads). The app frequently crashes for me on runs longer than 5 miles - sometimes at random and more frequently when I go to end a run. I have contacted Nike support multiple times and nobody has been able to resolve my issues. So incredibly frustrating and baffling that Apple would choose to partner with/feature such a glitchy app on an otherwise great smart watch. The phone version of the app is also lacking - I am unable to tell some basic things about my runs, like what time they started and ended at. Instead the app is too focused on the ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù aspect of running. It would also be great if they could use AI or some other technique to adjust for clear GPS issues - often my runs show me veering suddenly into the Hudson River or other abnormalities due to spotty GPS. Nike needs to focus on getting the basics fixed.I like to think we are in control of our own happiness, but this app really tested that theory. Just got back from a run using this garbage app, and I‚Äôm completely annoyed. It constantly paused my music, or the workout entirely, forcing me to keep a watchful eye on it throughout. Then, the audio coach just disappeared, audio silence for 10m with my music turned down as if she was still talking, leaving my phone vibrating and doing interval countdowns that weren‚Äôt being explained to me. My music eventually paused again randomly and I hit play (again) and then *poof* the audio coach is back cheering me on after missing 1/3 of the workout. After another 3 minutes of audio glitches the app somehow severed the connection to my wireless headphones completely. My phone was still connected to them via Bluetooth, batteries good, but nothing would play through them. Then the workout started playing through my phone itself and again pausing itself over and over, requiring me to stare at my phone while running, constantly battling with it. What a nightmare, deleting this trash off my phone for good.I specifically bought the Apple Watch to run with it, without the need for a phone, while listening to music and recording the run. This app has gotten progressively less reliable. Currently it just hangs at the start menu and the watch has to be powered down and restarted to regain control and start a run. It showed a random selection of recent runs in the history on the watch, like one from Sunday and one from Thursday, but Tuesday is missing. This application is not worth the time to download.
I saw a Nike reply to another review that pointed out how badly their app performs and there reply was the app is as fresh as a new pair of kicks, which doesn‚Äôt say much for their shoes. How hard is it to do what the other running apps seem to do without issue, track runs, start reliably, synchronized with other devices, not lose runs when you finish the run?? Their ‚Äúgreat‚Äù social aspects of their app are a joke, the entire top third of leaderboards appear to be falsified runs at least they have limited the fake runs to 50 km per day...update after switching to iPhone:

After multiple iterations, amazingly Nike continues to make their app worse.

Incredibly sluggish to start, seriously should it really take at least three tries and over 30 seconds to get it started every time????
This ‚Äúfeature‚Äù makes the app nearly worthless for races.

How is it even possible that Nike took a perfectly useful app and made it so frustrating  and useless that every day you want to delete it?

And what‚Äôs up with deleting the website?  Making the app sluggish and unresponsive  wasn‚Äôt enough damage?   Nike figures that no serious runner keeps track of their stats, so there‚Äôs no need to maintain the web access.

Original review from July 2017:

Wow... where to start?    I've used Nike+ for more than eight years.   It's had its ups and downs but has been generally useful for keeping track of runs.   This new iteration has inexplicably made a useful app completely and utterly useless.   For those of us using an iPod Touch (no gps) the app is not capable of calculating accurate mileages.  And here's the really inexplicable part, they removed (removed?!?) the recalibration function that has been part of the software since its beginning.    Are you kidding me?!?  This function is ABSOLUTELY essential in running software!!!  You took it off so you could put more social media crap that runners will never use on your app?  Great move.   You've lost a loyal user.I have used this app for the past two years, along with have the Apple Watch 3 Nike+ model. 

The app on my iPhone is flawless and works perfectly fine. No issues with mileage being off or the app crashing during runs. Overall, a good PHONE APP!

When it comes to the NRC on my AW3, it is a nightmare. I run with my phone, and start the run on the app on my phone which syncs it to the Watch. It‚Äôs nice being able to glance at my wrist to check pace/mileage/etc during a run without taking the phone out of my arm band. For the past month (approx 20 runs), around the 30 minute mark, I‚Äôll glance down at my watch and constantly receive the ‚Äúconnection lost‚Äù message from the NRC app. So now if I wanna check on pace/mileage/etc I have to take the phone out of my arm band to check. I‚Äôm running in suburban/rural areas so there‚Äôs no blaming city skyscrapers or anything like that. Open fields. When I finish my run, I don‚Äôt lose it on my app fortunately, but then I have to re-sync the AW3 NRC app to my phone. I know it seems like a first world problem, but I‚Äôve even gone as far as deleting off of my phone and watch, rebooting, reinstalling, and the problem still continues. 

I‚Äôve now gotten to the point of trying to decide if I want to just use Map My Run or just go with a Garmin watch instead. 

Unless there‚Äôs an answer to this problem someone has, the move will be made soon!!!Update: Nike is winning a war of attrition by hoping all the old faithful users will give up and forget how awesome and simplistic it used to be. Nike is envious of social media apps. It's overcrowded with too much fluff. At least bring back access of friends stats! :(

Update: After thousands of negative reviews stating the old design was far superior, Nike refuses to listen by making small updates!!!

Nike is ruining a good running app by forcing it into another form of social media. They've scrapped what made it the best running app, and made hashtags the focal point! The new design should make the app easier to use not harder and more complicated. The friends section was downgraded. I can't access their stats and info as before. Connecting with friends is more difficult now. Instead of competition between my friends, I‚Äôm forced to join hashtags with people I don't know. I will probably go back to the Strava app. I will be changing apps until Nike gets its act together!!!Do not use Nike Run Club with your Apple Watch if you want to actually track your runs. The app worked great for the first 3 months using it, but it has glitched the past 5 times that I have tried using it. When I finish, the run that I just completed disappears. Today was the last straw, as I hit a PR long run and when I ended the run on my watch, it was gone. So frustrating. Also, I can confidently say that it is not my watch, as the Workout app tracks my runs just fine every time. I only used NRC for the social aspect, tracking mileage on my shoes, and the occasional guided run, but it is not worth it since I have to enter each run manually now and I lose all heart rate, route, and pace data. Just as a side note, I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app prior to this run hoping that it would help the glitching problem, but obviously it did not.I used the old Nike running app to train for my first half marathon a few years ago. Right before the race they did a major overhaul of the app that ruined all my progress.

Then they recovered over time as they SLOWLY got the NRC app up to speed. And now they shoot us in the foot AGAIN! They have removed the fantastic adaptive coaching plans. Why?! Why actually remove a valuable feature? Instead, they focus on adding pointless social media connectivity. I guess I figured the point of the NRC app would be help me run, but apparently it‚Äôs more about Facebook and Instagram. I can do that on the couch without Nike‚Äôs help.

By the way, Nike - please remove the note about ‚Äúadaptive coaching plans‚Äù from the app description. It‚Äôs still mentioned there even as of today, though you axed them several updates back. Maybe you were too busy tweeting about running to notice.What happened to this? It used to be a running app. I‚Äôve used this app for years and years for training. Now it‚Äôs a over bloated running app that focuses its energy on social media and sales. Two of the five tabs in the app are dedicated for sales now. I‚Äôm using the app to run. I don‚Äôt think ANYONE cares about your feed or your products mid-stride. 
1. Why does the GPS functionality on the Apple Watch only work when I have my phone now? It use to work standalone. 
2. Why can I not start a My Coach session on the watch? At least when will I be able to start and stop intervals on the watch.
3. Indoor running with this app is a joke. 25% of my runs come within 25% of the distance I actually run. I ran a full mile with the treadmill set to 10mph and the post run clocked me at 8:30+. Ha. Nailed it. 
You would think, partnering with Apple you‚Äôd have an idea of their product line and sales figures. Did anyone REALLY stop to think at Nike that‚Äôd it might be a good idea to take advantage of the watch we co-branded for 4 years instead of relying on an ever enlarging phone? 

There is no reason you can have guided runs on an Apple Watch but you cannot do more with My Coach. 
 
Just Do Better.There‚Äôs potential here but it sounds like this app has seen better days. It definitely isn‚Äôt user friendly trying to sync with the community events and stuff going isn‚Äôt happening and doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Starting up a run takes do long the Apple Watch screen saver kicks in. This means I have to keep tapping the screen just to keep it fresh so I can start logging my run. Sometimes the total distance traveled during the week isn‚Äôt the same even within the app which when you are flipping between different functions off this app, a little embarrassing. Still it has potential, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard for the market to nail whether it‚Äôs Nike, Fitbit or whoever - it doesn‚Äôt seem anyone is delivering a truly enjoyable unique and dynamic, but stable social workout experience.I have over 5000 miles logged with Nike+ and Nike Run Club over maybe 1000 runs.  The good: it tracks distance, time, your splits.  With Apple Watch or other supported device you can track heart rate.  The bad: so many great past features have been dropped to make this a pretty bare bones running app.  It‚Äôs hard to see how many miles you‚Äôve run in a month or a year.  You can no longer see where you‚Äôve run except by opening each and every individual run.  Gone are the leaderboards with your friends or the integration with other social networks.  Challenges used to be really good but now they stink.  Completely dropped web support.  NRC is a shadow of what Nike+ used to be.  Over the years I‚Äôve gotten 50 or 100 to try Nike+ and honestly in good conscious I cannot recommend this app.The app performs as expected, though cluncky and glitchy, especially if a call comes through. It‚Äôs great at auto pausing, less so at auto resume. A few runs have taught me that. However, the activity you collect used to be easily found online as well via a web browser. Since I do all my data collection, reduction, and planning on my computer, it‚Äôs useless as an actual tool for that purpose since the website no longer allows you to see your data. Therefore, the app is useless to me as a training tool and simply a backup should my Harmon lose connection or battery die at 25%... sigh. One day someone will solve the woes of a triathlete.

1. Show friends level and/or miles. One of the most driving things is to not be outdone by your friends. People work hard to get to a certain level. What‚Äôs the point if nobody can see it but you?
Bring back challenges. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre gone completely or just hidden, but challenges were fun! It gets people moving who may not be moving. 
I‚Äôm not with all of the social stuff with strangers. I think the app is going in a direction of social media, but taking away from the social part of friends interacting with friends. I don‚Äôt see a need to share pictures of my run with strangers who could care less, just as I could care less about theirs. 
I also miss the part where we could get cheers from Facebook. That was motivation on your run. I used it all of the time. Then it was messed up where it posted a picture on my Facebook and and didn‚Äôt shut down the post when I was done running so people could comment on it all day....instead of just fixing that, I guess they just took that feature away completely.This is reliable and its interface while running is good in keeping it simple enough yet tracking sufficient data. It just hasn‚Äôt changed in a while, lacks social components of others, and metrics of other apps. There‚Äôs a vast coaching library but the narrators get annoying since most of the time you don‚Äôt want to hear someone talking in your ear about your run.  I‚Äôve found the running program for marathon horrible and that may apply to the other training programs. It lacked a holistic approach, lacked sufficient workouts (even with cross-training) and left me in my worst shape ever for a marathon.  After making Volt level, I was personally dismayed that NRC no longer even makes an acknowledgment of the accomplishment, at least for Volt. After getting so bummed that Nike didn‚Äôt even acknowledgment my 14-year quest, I‚Äôve dropped them and have happily discovered some other greats apps. Please keep shopping around before considering NRC. I‚Äôve used them for more than 10 years but now realize how much I missed out from other apps. You aren‚Äôt married to NRC.This app was terrific when it first launched for the watch.  Was the first running watch app that gave you everything you needed and was simple to use. A joy that made me so happy I invested in the Apple Watch.   Every subsequent update has made it worse.  The sync has become less reliable and I routinely lose several runs a month.  They just disappear from the watch after completion. Starting a run has become 5 to 10 minute exercise in frustration as the huge yellow start button on the watch face is often unresponsive. When you run at 5AM before work every minute counts.  The latest software update is now refusing to install on the watch at all, so now I have had to default back to the workout app that comes standard on the watch.  I have a suspicion that the massive amount of data associated with all the new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù like coaching and social networking and challenges (which are completely pointless) have overwhelmed the software / hardware and ruined what was a great product.  Nike and Apple... you are better than this.updating review from 1y ago:

notes are back (thank you!) and the new design is really nice. I‚Äôve just switched to iPhone X and it was a pleasant surprise that the app is already optimized for it.

With that being said, I turned it on and started running, as always, but as I wasn‚Äôt listening to the feedback I set it up after a few minutes, I checked and as I unlocked my phone, the countdown started again, time was running from when I originally started but the distance was not. I turned it off, took a break and restarted it. Made sure the countdown was over and it was tracking before putting it in my pocket again and a couple of minutes later voila; no feedback. it did the same thing. I really like this app and can‚Äôt wait for it to properly track my runs again! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

Hopefully the massive amounts of poor reviews will have a positive effect on the upcoming updates. I don't think we could be any louder about how disappointing the new app is.

The social media aspect is overwhelming, the badges - which were a big source of motivation for me - were taken away, and the calibration seems off since all of a sudden my pace is way higher than it used to be for no reason. I also miss the Note feature (adding a title to the run sounds a little random/pointless). 
I would love to have more of the old app back, less Instagram-ish please.Love the app, the guided runs are the best. But I hate starting my run, putting my phone in my pocket, running for 10 minutes or so, then going to check my watch to see my progress and having nothing show up. The app should start automatically like now playing. Now I have to slow down, get my phone out of my pocket to skip songs or check my progress, thus dinging the progress of my self improvement. When I do open the app manually on my watch, it wants me to start a new run independent of my current run. Makes no sense. There is no communication between the phone app and the watch app. Please fix this, because I love the motivation and coaching the guided runs give, and the social integration. But I‚Äôm afraid if this doesn‚Äôt get fixed I‚Äôll have to switch to another app.I love using the app, it‚Äôs great on the phone. However, on the Apple Watch the experience in bad. It‚Äôs painful to use guided runs on Apple Watch. Going though the list of tracks, selecting, downloading, then closing the app and repeating it all again. It‚Äôs frustrating that there is no tab for downloaded or saved guided runs. 
It would be so good to be able to have saved guided runs synced between the phone and watch. So I would select it on the phone and have it downloaded on the watch.
Also it‚Äôs frustrating that you download a run, go out, and can‚Äôt find it without the internet connection even though it‚Äôs downloaded on the watch. Doesn‚Äôt make sense and makes very back user experience.In 2020, this app was terrific on my Apple Series 3. It kept me motivated out on my runs, and it was so convenient to see my progress at a flip of my wrist. This summer, the app has been horrible on the watch. Don't get me wrong, it works great on the iPhone, but rarely ever syncs to my Apple Watch when I want to start a run. When it does sync, 10-15 minutes into the run, I get an error on my watch, ""Connection Lost"". Not sure what Nike did from 2020 to now, but it appears it's all out of whack on the watch (at least the Series 3). I'm bummed because I accumulated many miles while ranking up my run level, but now, it's in the trash can, and I'm back on Apple's trusty fitness app. Sorry Nike, you have some work to do.The new update fixed a lot of the bugs, my app used to crash when listening to music. Also, I signed up for a half marathon training challenge a while back and 6 weeks in or so the app lost all of my workouts. So don't get me wrong, the app needed to be updated. However, one thing I liked most about the app, prior to the update, was being able to challenge friends to runs/distances. That feature is now completely gone. You can see how far your friends have gone over a week or month period but the capability of challenging is gone. I wish this app was more social. Dear Nike, bring back the challenge feature and while you're at it, let us tag other users on runs.Been a Nike fan my whole life‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm so disappointed. With all the money and resources Nike has‚Ä¶ they should really have a smooth and good app. There are so many glitches that it‚Äôs by FAR the worst fitness tracking app I‚Äôve used. Even when you complete a run in your workout plan, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mark itself as complete. There‚Äôs also no option to mark it complete manually. It‚Äôs not a smooth connection with Apple Watch‚Ä¶ which for a company who has collaboration with Apple is questionable. And indoor run tracks don‚Äôt work and don‚Äôt track miles even if you mark indoor run. Over all this literally deserved one star if that‚Ä¶",0,Used to be betterStill works well but dated.Great when it works... but it rarely works:(Please fix Apple Watch syncPlease add ‚Äúdownloaded guided runs‚Äù to Apple WatchGlitchy on Apple WatchIt's just okaySeriously‚Ä¶.?!,James 3476321JuniorrazatlanticresinterplanetaireShadesmctubaDmitryH0MoserDesignsBay_flyEliboo918,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,2,0,1,1,9,4,0,0,1,1506,has_social,60

1. The inability to use a run in my history towards my training plan. For instance, I did a long run today that for some reason didn‚Äôt sync to my training plan, so according to the plan, I didn‚Äôt do the run despite it being in my history. If I add the run manually to the plan it will show up in my history twice and my monthly milage will be inaccurate, plus the frustration of knowing I ran but seeing this week as an incomplete in the training plan. There should be in option to add an existing run to the plan for that corresponding day. 

2. This isn‚Äôt as big of a deal, but the social media aspect of this app is far from perfect. With Run keeper your friends are automatically able to see your runs with all of the attached data-splits, milage, pace etc. Nike went for more of a social media approach where you can take a pic and make a post with your milage, pace, and avg time but anything else would have to be added in the caption. Not a huge deal but I vastly prefer Run Keeper where my friends can see all the details of my run automatically and there are no adds blocking up the feedHey team, hope y‚Äôall are all doing well. Wanted to write up some feedback in hopes that this app will improve. I wanted to say that one of the toughest things to do within the app is finding ways to connect and run with your friends. Strava does really great in this to where you can see the feed of your friends runs! I can‚Äôt even figure out how to reconnect my Facebook, Instagram or contacts within this app. I see my friends sharing their runs on social media sometimes, but there is no way I can find them within the Nike Run app. The run community is a huge collective of people doing the same thing together, running. So, my wish is that it were easier to connect with my fellow runners within my social circle - whether it be through Facebook, Instagram, Google, contact info, or whatever else. Everything else is great. I love the workout plans, marathon training, and everything else. This is what makes the app great. But, the lack of social connection really brings the app down for me, and I‚Äôm sure a lot of others. I wish you all the best!I‚Äôve been using Nike+ for 10 years. I‚Äôve always been loyal even as other apps started to grow in popularity and have more social features. I‚Äôm struggling to stay loyal. 

I used coach for half marathon training 3-4 years ago and crushed it. This year I‚Äôm using coach and it‚Äôs definitely not the same program. It barely has me running 10 miles for a long run before the race. Also, if I don‚Äôt log into app and assign a run to a run in the plan, that week, it doesn‚Äôt log it towards my plan. Last week, I did a 10k on Sunday and didn‚Äôt log in and now it doesn‚Äôt count that run in my training plan even though it‚Äôs sitting there in my run history.  I also can‚Äôt move a planned long run into a different week (want on Sunday, not Tuesday). 

I like some of the social features, guided runs and whatnot but missing some of the things I used to love. Not the ‚Äúcoach‚Äù it used to be.I got the app a couple of weeks ago and jumped into a plan. I really like it so far, but there are some issues with the connection to the regular NFC app when toggling between to complete a non running workout ‚Äî one time it didn‚Äôt register that I‚Äôd done the workout, so I did the workout again. It still never cleared, so at the end of the week it wouldn‚Äôt give the green check and it looked like an incomplete week of workouts for me. It‚Äôs a small thing, but I think most people like to be given credit for what they‚Äôve done. And there appears to be no way for me to edit that I completed it like I fixed a run recording when it didn‚Äôt record because I‚Äôd turned off my screen during the countdown ‚Äî maybe that should be changed because it is difficult to put my phone back into my run belt fast enough during the countdown.Ok, so I normally don‚Äôt even rate apps, but I‚Äôm so frustrated with this one! I really like the guided runs, and I already made my running buddies join so we can motivate each other, so the social aspect of NRC is good, it‚Äôs the main reason I‚Äôm sticking with this app...however, there‚Äôs other more user friendly apps out there, like Runkeeper...but now their training plans aren‚Äôt free anymore. 

So the main frustration comes from:
1. Apple Watch doesn‚Äôt sync well with the phone, you can‚Äôt access your training plan.
2. When using the speed runs on your scheduled training you don‚Äôt get a notification once you‚Äôve met the goal of each interval, also, don‚Äôt know how long we‚Äôre supposed to rest in between.

I would‚Äôve opted for a different option than the Apple Watch were it not for this app, I figured the integration would be better, it just seems like it‚Äôs a hassle to get the information synced across devices, and when following a training plan it would be nice to access it from the ‚ÄúNike Apple Watch‚Äù.The app is decent overall. I only started using the Nike running app because all of my coworkers are using it and it‚Äôs fun to track each others mileage. The app has some cool social media type features and guided runs. The watch and app combo already glitched on me twice after completing a long run. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling to finish a 10 plus mile distance only for the app to glitch at the end and not record your route and splits. Yes, you can manually input your mileage into the app, but it‚Äôs just not the same. Might have to go back to Garmin.",0,"Almost a great appLet‚Äôs connect!Rollercoaster of ups and downsSticking with itPoor integrationDecent App, lags and glitches often",SiennanaElPeytonBlancoProudkKitkitluluGitalitamarcthousand,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,1048,has_social,60

Incorporating more of the social aspect would be better. Being able to interact w my friends on this app makes it more fun! But I can barely interact w them on here. The navigation is not very user friendly or necessarily at the point that it promotes engagement with one another. For example, a friend of mine goes running all the time but I can only occasionally ‚Äúcheer him on‚Äù through the app and support that he‚Äôs going for a run. For him, although I run twice a day every day, he never gets updates when I go for a run and he can‚Äôt cheer me on at all. If you could create a way for users to engage in friendly challenges to meet goals through the app that would also be great. I love this app and I LOVE Nike but I just wish there was more. ‚òπÔ∏èWell-built and beautiful app, however it‚Äôs missing a few things that feel like they should be automatic in an app like this.  I would like to see:  
    1) An option to share and view the full analytics of runs (i.e. I want that beautiful menu that comes up for my runs to come up for others runs) 
    2) An option to automatically post to feed on completion of a run 
    3) Better handling of leaderboards.  There are a few trolls that clearly and regularly spoof their milage on challenges.  (e.g. it‚Äôs been 8 hours since the start of this week‚Äôs 15k challenge and someone already has over 100 miles)

Other suggestions:
    1)  It seems like Nike wants this to be a strong mix between a running app and a social media app.  They should take more from popular social media apps if that‚Äôs the case.  Location based stickers, stories, etc.
    2)  More should be done with clubs. There are actual running clubs everywhere,  allow them to create clubs on the app and to keep track to stats through the app.I don‚Äôt use the app to be social and share my runs, but I like something to keep me accountable. Plus, it‚Äôs motivation enough to see myself racking up the miles each week and see improvement in my time. üëçüèª
I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because it doesn‚Äôt link up to my music sometimes and it also shuts down my phone in the middle of my run which is unfortunate because I run in the country and have had a cougar scare in the middle of my run and I couldn‚Äôt use my phone. I was too scared to go anywhere. 
Oh and I hate the encouraging words at the end of my run. I feel the are a little condescending. Lol! ü§£ so I shut them off.I trust Nike coaches and this makes it a 5 star review. Over time, my rating only dropped down to a 4 because I progressed so much with the app, that i desired more from the app. 
1. I wish speed runs stopped notified you when you hit the distance in each rep. It‚Äôs pretty annoying to have to take your phone out to start and stop.
2. I wish you could train for more distances, such as an 8k.  The standard 5k, 10k, half, and full marathon are great, but I‚Äôd love to see more added
3. I wish you could simultaneously do a program/plan on both Nike Running and Nike Training. 
4. There are some minor glitches with the social media aspect of things. Not all friends are able to cheer you on, or my stickers disappear for posts, tagging friends doesn‚Äôt always work

Again, the fact that it‚Äôs free and already does all it that it does, truly makes it a 5 Star app. My wish #4 is so extra, but if Nike could grant my first 3 wishes, the app would be beyond amazing!I really tried to like this app on my Apple Watch series 2, but it is simply horrible. Sometimes the gps would not work. I have given it several chances by downloading it at different times hoping it has got better and it is simply not a reliable app. What a runner want to get out and run not fidget with this stupid app. I tried one of the audio workouts and it was fun, but next day their isn‚Äôt a custom workout for it. On top of that the social media part is overrated. There is FB for that. At the end it is back to the standard Apple run. Why is it great? The software engineer designed a simple app that works.I‚Äôm a recreational runner and this app has been very serviceable over the 6 years I‚Äôve used it. The social function and the shoe tagging feature are all great, and I love the badges and milestone tracking. Just two complaints- I don‚Äôt like feeling advertised to when it‚Äôs time to run, and updates over the last few years have made this app feel more like a magazine. Second is that when I add a new shoe that isn‚Äôt Nike brand and doesn‚Äôt have an assigned picture, I can‚Äôt add a picture myself. Not a big deal for everyone, but I don‚Äôt like it.I like this App; however, 30 seconds into my run, I lose connection with my Apple Watch (Every Time). I can not track my heart rate. I can not track my heart rate zones. This is very frustrating for me, seeing how this is what it is designed to do. Additionally, a recommendation for the guided runs, explicitly the 200 meter X 8 and 200 meter X 4, announce each 200-meter completion, so I don't have to look at my phone just like every other guided run. If I weren't losing connection with this App, I would rate it as a five (5).",0,"Been a HUGE fan of Nike since I was 12Missing a few simple thingsKeeps me motivatedAmazing overall.

The option to share your route is pointless because it doesn‚Äôt have a map underlayed so it doesn‚Äôt mean much. And I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt share you your route AND your distance, time, and pace at the same time, (or any other combination of run details). And lastly, there should be more pre-made backgrounds for sharing to social media. There‚Äôs only 12 or so options available now, and some of them make it difficult or impossible to see the run info you put on there. Other than that, I love this app. I like that you can set a goal for each run and it lets you know when you‚Äôve reached half of that goal and also let‚Äôs you know your mile splits. Great app! Just improve the social aspect.Easily the best run app for iPhone/Apple Watch. Tracks well, social stuff is good, and is a great training tracker.

I‚Äôve been using this app off and on since 2016 and I really like it for the most part. However today I was running and paused at the top of the mountain and my watch paused bc I stopped which is normal but then it took it another step and completed the run altogether about 1.69 miles in. So‚Ä¶. I had to start a new run. I ran another 3.5 miles and completed the 5.1 mile loop I wanted to run today. 

Well I wanted to see if I could just edit the length of the 2nd part of the run sun the map image was fine and I wanted to share the run on social media. What I wanted to do was combine the 2 runs  since my watch stopped early on, and make it just 1 total run. But when I edited the run it gave me the pop up of course that the run may not count toward badges since it‚Äôs edit. But then I went to save the run and it wouldn‚Äôt let me save and the the run just vanished from my history altogether.

So now if you look at my history for today you only see the 1.69 miles beginning but not the 3.6 miles second part. My question is where did it go? Snd can I get it back.

Also let‚Äôs say I accidentally delete it instead of saving, I think it would be nice to have a way to undelete if it was an accident. 

That‚Äôs all. 

Just do it‚Ä¶ just fix the app. Do it‚Ä¶ just do it already. 

SwooshI am by no means a runner, in fact it is one of the things I hate doing the most, on top of that I have asthma so the thought of running usually stresses me out.  With the COVID-19 crisis and it having a large impact your respiratory system I was told to exercise my lungs to keep them healthy. Well being stuck inside a small nyc apartment doesn‚Äôt really make that easy. So I started to run and used this app to help me keep track. Then I saw on social media that my friends were also starting to run and using the app. So we started to use it together to hold each other accountable virtually. When I did contract the COVID-19 virus, my lungs held up and I got through pretty okay. However getting back into exercising has not been easy. I recently started to use the apps preset runs where a coach guides you through. This has been a GAME CHANGER. The stress free one is my favorite. If you‚Äôre like me, not a runner, and hate doing it, these are super motivating üí™üèΩI‚Äôve been using this app consistently since October now (about 6 months). It‚Äôs been an incredible resource on my journey and took me from a casual runner to someone who just finished their first marathon and has more planned. While I adore the app‚Äôs training plans and UI, my one major gripe is that speed interval runs require you to be constantly staring at your phone to ensure you stop at the correct distance, and the structure of how the app considers ‚Äúlaps‚Äù means that your rest periods just end up bringing down your average pace significantly, rather than showing up as rest periods. Additionally, the social features are very much lacking. I use Strava as well, which is much more polished in this regard. When going to a friend‚Äôs profile, there is no way to see any of their runs or really any relevant information. The only friend interactions are cheering us on and doing challenges together, which I consider lacking.Until 2 days ago I would have given this app a 5 star rating, but one of the most valuable features has become unusable and there is no indication of what I can do or any sign that the company is aware of the problem (I have searched help pages and checked online user boards).  I completed a 5K coaching plan 2 days ago and have tried at least 2 dozen times since to start a new plan.  Each time I enter my information and the app goes to build a plan, then brings up a message ‚Äúa communication error has occurred. Please try again later.‚Äù  I have tried using both WiFi and cellular connections, I have logged out and back in, and I have even reinstalled the app.  Please have the developers address this or I will be deleting this app.Overall it is a great free running app from a reputable company in sports. You don‚Äôt have to pay someone $5/month to record your runs and give a few tips and social features. 

However, these two issues makes it only a mediocre app - for now.
There is no volume option for audio guided runs. The result is that the voice coach is so low that I have to stop, cover my ears and listen carefully for the instructions. Note, this is supposed to be a speed run in outdoor trails. And I had to stop , cover ears and listen what‚Äôs going on. (I was wearing a pair of AirPod without iPhone with me, not sure if that‚Äôs the reason) anyone can tell me how to turn up the volume for voice guided runs? 

Second, consistency. Sometimes it just crashed doe no reason. I had a run for approximately 10 miles the past Saturday, when I crossed the finish line, guess what I noticed? The apps quit already . When I restarted the app, only 4.6mile out of the 10 mile run was recorded. This can be frustrating if i wore it for NYC marathon and not having the app recording the precious data for the work!The coaches are great. You really feel somebody is guiding you and that is the kind of motivation I just needed to continue.
The only bug I found is when you are being couched from your watch, when the coach go silent, the connection between watch and airpod will be lost and when he start talking again, his sound will be played from the watch speaker. Its really annoying in the middle of a run. I hope they fix it in the next update. Again, thank you for this amazing app.No joke. This app changed my life. I started running for physical and mental health reasons. The tracking functions. The watch companion app. The social functioncs. The challenges and awards system. I got hooked on running but also getting achievements on the app. Became obssesed with the achievements system. Its like a video game! 2 years of use my life is totally different. I dont think I would have stuck with running if it wasnt for this app and running has saved my life and gave me a second chance and a new start. Thank you Nike!I‚Äôve tried so many running apps but Nike does it right. One best quality I like about the app is that you don‚Äôt need internet connection to have it work especially people like me that love to run on out door trails in rural areas. 

Just a suggestion to Nike run club, the iwatch play, pause, stop, & water function buttons are really close each other. The stop and water buttons should be smaller and put to the upper left side because I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve accidentally pressed Stop or the water button.I love this app, but I am unable to use the find friends feature.  A connection error message always pops up. This has been going on for years. Nike could show this app a little bit more love. Some things have gotten much better, like mapping the route even if you forgot to resume the run, and calculating pace for splits when you don‚Äôt pause the guided runs. Thanks for NRC! It‚Äôs still a great app. I miss the Nike store runs!The app works well and social aspects are fine but I want an app to track my miles and give me statistics, I can and do go elsewhere for social networking.

I‚Äôve previously used both MapMyRun and Runtastic and the ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù provided by both doesn‚Äôt amount to much more than telling you your splits, distance, and when the pace changes on intervals. It‚Äôs done by a computer generated voice and just doesn‚Äôt have the real person connection. Coach Bennett will relate to you and motivate every step of the way while not being overbearing and in your ear the whole time. There are minutes set aside during every run where it‚Äôs just you, the music, and the run. It gives you time to reflect on what Coach has said let‚Äôs you focus in on what you are doing. The last thing I‚Äôll mention are companion playlists, while most of the songs are some form of pop or pop/Rock they are upbeat and provide a nice soundtrack to run to. Even for me who isn‚Äôt a big pop fan, I‚Äôve added a few songs to my personal library thanks to NRC. 

So, if you‚Äôre like me and struggle to find motivation to get out and get going, give NRC a try and hopefully you find it as great as I do.I‚Äôve had periods of running here and there for almost a decade and used NRC since at least 2013. However, what really got me locked on this app almost daily and thereby an amateur runner is its wonderful guided runs. Audio guided programming based on a wide range of topics, distances, run types, and times as well as a newbie running series has eased me into running in a way I‚Äôve never had before. The Headspace collab was also an amazing treat and helped me a lot last autumn when I was dealing with tough personal issues. Running became a safe haven in the day and made me love working out again. Turns out running is about the only workout to do outside during quarantine, too. I wish the social aspect was improved natively on app so that I can engage with friends without seeming like I‚Äôm bragging or being annoying on Facebook or Instagram. Also, the apple watch version of the app needs some more work, but the mobile experience has been very meaningful for me despite some minor problems. The my coach function I could do without. Otherwise, love love love this app.I started using NRC a little while back and became so frustrated because it wouldn‚Äôt work at all with my iWatch. It would pause my runs when on the treadmill and the guided runs never seemed to work. So I switched to Under Armour‚Äôs ‚ÄúMap My Run App‚Äù (which is still a very nice option). About a month ago I decided to see if improvements were made, because this app has some great features that are hard to pass up - like guided runs and coaching plans. Boy am I glad that I decided to give it another try!! Syncing has been seamless and I haven‚Äôt lost any runs. I love the watch app so much more than any other option too, it is a really great watch app. The challenges keep me motivated, though I would definitely appreciate if that was built out a little more, with more ‚Äúevents‚Äù, and also it would be nice to be able to connect more easily with other NRC users in my area, maybe give an opt-in option to enrich the social aspect of the app too. All in all, this is the best running app out there, especially with an iWatch!!!I‚Äôve been using Nike run club since your needed a fob attached to your shoe. Back then I loved that it did a better job of tracking my miles than I did. Over the years, the features have expanded to include adding friends and social groups, phone and watch support, to running coaches and guided runs. It consistently beats the competition and you can‚Äôt go wrong using Nike Run Club. Add to all that the customer support is responsive and polite and you‚Äôve got one of the best fitness apps on the market. The only downside is the rest of the market! I‚Äôve not a true marathoner, I‚Äôm a triathloner and the compatibility with apps that track my swims and bikes just isn‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs not Nike Run Club‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs all politics and drama, but it would be great if Nike could branch out into some multisport tracking and put out an app as good as Nike Run Club but for bikes and swimming!I used NRC to help me train for my 1st half marathon all the way through my 10th half. It has vastly improved over the years and has never let me down. If I accidentally close the app while I‚Äôm running, I just need to reopen it and my run will continue. If I want to share a photo of my run and share my stats on social media, there‚Äôs options of how much I want to share as well as fun stickers to put on my photos. There‚Äôs badges and achievements to earn. It lets me record which shoes I use for each one so I can track how many miles I put on them. There‚Äôs audio guided runs to help anyone run for the first time and how to do recovery runs. I can say I want to do a timed or a distance based run. And sometimes, I just want to run and there‚Äôs an option for that too. Overall, it‚Äôs one of my favorite apps. Thanks Nike for believing in the athlete in all of us.Love it! Keeps me running every day. Wish there was a feature with maps where you could map out a run in advance of starting your run... otherwise it has everything you need corrected many of the issues I mentioned in my previous review, so I am actually very pleased with the current version. You still have the edit your shoe selection after each run, cannot designate a favorite shoe, and cannot delete old shoes. 

On the brighter side, the run tracking has become much more consistent and the leaderboard charts among your Nike network contacts are accurate actually update properly making this a really cool way to connect with competitive friends. 

Overall, much better than before and certainly the best free running app out. 

Used to love this app, but the recent update makes it unnecessarily difficult to use. They greatly diminished the actual attractive social features of this app by making it very challenging to interact with your real friends and compare activity. In place of that, they produced a half-hearted attempt of user interaction that stars a newsfeed of irrelevant running posts. It's now harder to modify standard settings, add friends, and just enjoy the app. Trim it downI used to run track in HS and I also raced bikes and did a bunch of other activities. After I got out of college and started adulting, I dropped it. Well, fast forward to the pandemic and I needed a way to stay healthy while being socially distanced, so I started running again. At first, I just couldn‚Äôt get into it and my improvement plateaued rather quickly‚Ä¶. Then I found NRC and the guided runs. What a game changer! Coach Bennet and the others are a great mix of coaching and just general advice. It‚Äôs made me a better runner and wanting to go out for my next run as soon as I finish my last run. Now in training for a half marathon, a distance I never thought I‚Äôd ever do. Thank you NRC!I‚Äôve been running with Nike+ RunClub and the Apple Watch app for the past few weeks and have to say I love it. Definitely an essential app if you are a runner, and even more so if you have an Apple Watch.

Pros:
-Accurate run tracking (splits, elevation change, etc.)
-Challenges to keep you motivated to run
-Social feed to connect with friends
-Share directly to social media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
-Guided runs with famous athletes like Mo Farrah and even one with Kevin Hart
-Automatically pauses runs if you stop 
-Very accurate heart rate tracking during run from watch 
-Achievements to unlock, records fastest 1K, farthest distance covered, longest run, etc.

Cons:
-In my personal experience I‚Äôve had some difficulty syncing runs when I initiate them from the watch. If I initiate the run from the app on my phone it syncs everything perfectly. However I‚Äôd have liked to be able to just press start on my watch and have it sync just as well.

All in all it‚Äôs the perfect app for any runner and the experience is even better if you have an Apple Watch. Plus, it‚Äôs free so you have nothing to lose. Definitely give it a shot!This is by far the best running app. Coach Bennet et al are great coaches and motivational speakers. Once you‚Äôre hooked, the app provides you with lots of guided runs for you to learn more about running and (most importantly) recovering. 
Several things I think would make this an even better app (by order of importance):

1) Integrated warmups and cool downs from the Nike Training Club app - make the run less of an hassle by having to switch from app to app. Without nudges for proper warm ups and cool downs, beginners are setting themselves for an injury at some point.

2) make the colors of the display during a run customizable. Dark blue digits in a bright sunny day makes keeping your pace very difficult.

3) ability to share runs to Strava - it is undeniable that the running community is a part of Strava. As perfect as the guided runs are, there is a social element missing in this app. Nike better create one (super hard when there is an established one already), or join the fray.

TAHNK YOU, NIKE for creating this app and Coach Bennett for being a bad*ss rockstar.Outstanding running app, I've used this app over two years and tried a few others in between just to have and see where I stand with the app.  However this app is amazing, motivation when you reach your goals, encouragement when it's been a few days since your last run... my recommendation is that from a marketing perspective I would collaborate more with Nike, and running clubs to reward members for reaching goals.  Everyone wants to workout however with add incentive you can push them further.  This will generate more attention to the app, stores and the free items will be advertised global on social media.  For more ideas reach out to me...Awesome app, it has the best running programs in any running app in my opinion. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to start the new program the next day, since I run in the morning. It would be nice to set the program up the night before for a run the next morning.

Other than that, I love the milestones and the social media aspect. It‚Äôs very versatile and easy to change between outside and treadmill runs on the fly. This app has really been a huge part of me getting healthy.I love the app so far. I can track monthly mileage and set goals.  It also allows for indoor work out plans so you don‚Äôt have to get creative yourself. 

My only 2 drawbacks:

1. The way your run will post to Social Media when you want to brag about your run. It only shows the route and distance. No total time or average pace. That would be cool to show on there as well to be able to give the entire story to your friends regarding your run. 

2.  The way you have to start the run from your phone and are unable to do it from the Apple Watch when using the app in order to hear your updates while you run even when the watch is connected via Bluetooth to your headphones.  A little nit picky I know but it should all be able to connect and work as one.At 59 I started jogging around in a confined space during COVID-19 surge in NY.  I‚Äôm not a runner but a walker.  NRC was recommended in an article re exercising alone.  I downloaded the app, started running with Coach Bennett and the rest is history.   I can officially say I am a Runner and I‚Äôll be ‚Äúrunning‚Äù for the rest of my life.

Take it from me, it‚Äôs the new out in these times of social distancing.  It gives the feeling of relief, relaxation and control.  I highly recommend this.

Ridiculous that this app is still an ‚ÄúEditors Choice‚Äù to boot when it‚Äôs just simply NOT WORKING! Same annoying problems as months ago when I last used it. Not synchronizing with my iPhone so my runs are lost, ending the tracking of a run in the middle of it, stopping and restarting the tracking of a run in the middle of it for no reason, not responding when trying to stop a run upon completion... Yes, it‚Äôs still complete and hopeless garbage. I‚Äôm amazed that so many other users seem to have similar problems yet the developers of this app still can‚Äôt find their way out of a paper bag and have it work properly on an Apple Watch. I‚Äôm also surprised that this app gets decent reviews. Are all those positive reviews fake? Come on, if it‚Äôs not synchronizing with your iPhone and you‚Äôre loosing the data relating to your runs, it‚Äôs just not working and it deserves ZERO stars, not even one star. 

Fortunately, I also rely on my Apple Workouts app so I can still track my activities even when the Nike Run app malfunctions. Given that the Apple Workout app has gotten better over time in terms of the features and analytics it offers, and is stable as a rock, I‚Äôm going to switch completely to it. No more frustration in dealing with this ridiculous piece of Nike garbage and, big bonus, I‚Äôm going to be freeing up 700MB of storage space.3 years ago this app was perfect. I used to carry my phone in my hand to track my runs through the app and it worked great. I enjoy the feeling of community that the app provides. I‚Äôve become a more serious runner and started using a Series 3 Apple Watch to run. For a while everything worked great but I found that sometimes I would look down at my watch to check my stats and it wouldn‚Äôt actually be tracking me at all even tho I know I started the run. Or I would pause the app and it would glitch and erase my run as I never was running. The issue that recurred the most would be I would finish my run and try to synch it to my phone and it would glitch and the run would be lost. I always keep my app updated and I‚Äôm currently (March 2020) using the newest products from Apple (watch and phone). I‚Äôve tried many times to work around the issue. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app...I disconnect from WiFi before I start. Nothing seems to work. After years of praising this app I can‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs discouraging to have a great run just for it to be lost. I‚Äôve started just using the activity app on the watch itself and it works great! I‚Äôve deleted the Nike App and will give them some time to hopefully improve.Crash crash crash. Using iPhone 8 and AW2 Nike version. Would think they are meant for each other right? But alas very disappointing. When trying to mirror a run on the watch that is being tracked on the phone the watch‚Äôs little pea brain is unable to keep up. Very slow to pick up the run and often have to restart the run multiple times. The crashes at the middle or the end of a long run and it crashes so hard can‚Äôt even stop the run on the watch because it keeps crashing. Then of course I have two runs logged. Isn‚Äôt this the purpose of buying what is otherwise a very functional watch? Been over this time and again with Nike tech support who are well intentioned but unable to fix an inherently flawed piece of dookie. And yes i did all the suggested fixes- reset restart reinstall update yadda yadda. And Apple is obviously uninterested. App works fine when tracking a run on the watch but battery life not enough for more than a 5-6 mile run. Sigh. If anyone from Nike or Apple is listening why don‚Äôt you try a run with your product? Meanwhile I‚Äôm looking for another app and gonna see if I can transfer the 3500+ miles I have on the app to something else. Thanks for nothing.This app can track runs but outside of that is pretty buggy and ultimately useless. You can turn off the annoying coaches at the end of your run UNLESS you use a watch to track your run. Also be careful while using a watch that doesn‚Äôt have data enabled because it sometimes just won‚Äôt sync to your phone for a few days or even weeks. There‚Äôs an almost helpful feature to add shoes so you can track milage easier, but it doesn‚Äôt even offer Nikes full catalog of running shoes. It offers non-running shoes for some reason though, which you‚Äôll find are offered to you to pick despite searching for your exact model and color of shoe because the search function is so incredibly awful.

Other than that, the app is just more ad space for Nike products. You‚Äôre better off tracking runs with the native iPhone/watch workout app. The native apps don‚Äôt have ads and track all the same information and have no problem syncing. The only thing you‚Äôll miss out on is MAYBE getting the chance to track milage on a pair of shoes.Used this app forever and loved it. On the most recent iOS update, something happened where all of the mile tracking is completely wrong when I‚Äôm in the city where I live. I have my routes memorized, and by the end of the run the app will say I ran nearly half a mile or more less than I actually did. I‚Äôve checked this discrepancy by running a distance and comparing it to Google Maps. It also isn‚Äôt the internal GPS, as that always reads the correct distance on the Health app. This is completely messing up all my running times and training. While at my parents‚Äô house recently, the app worked and clocked the correct time. Between one day and the next, running the same pace, the app recorded a 45 second difference in my mile times. This has been going on for over a month. I don‚Äôt want to quit this app because I have thousands of miles logged on it but please, please fix this so I can actually train for the upcoming race season. This app is becoming pretty much useless for anything but noting that I‚Äôve run on a particular day.I use this with my Apple Watch when I run. I would love it if it‚Äôs UI and interfacing with Watch wasn‚Äôt so confusing and defective. 

Earlier this week I did a run with a Series 2 Nike watch and the phone in my pocket (because the audio on some of these runs won‚Äôt work with just the watch). I started the run on the phone, and for whatever reason at the end no heart rate was captured (despite this working when I run with watch only).

Today I tried to do a Speed guided run. Hoping for better results I wore a Series 3 with GPS and iPhone 7 in my pocket (again because some of these guided runs won‚Äôt do audio without the phone). I started the run on my phone while the NRC was open (but not started) on my watch. 

The run started and my watch seemed to see that to, and after showing a frozen set of stats for a while it seemed to be tracking the same run. A few minutes into the run it just stopped. No idea why. So there goes my speed run - it‚Äôs not like I can do these over and over until this defective app works.

Even weirder - the app showed TWO runs synced, one a little longer than another. It‚Äôs as if the watch and the phone both thought they were recording different runs.

And not being able to easily share to iMessage is a big thumbs down, and a curious exclusion considering how tight Nike has been with Apple. For now I am scoring it low - hope they add support for sharing to iMessage and fix the watch integration.This app is unreliable. While in a run, music might or might not work. Heart rate WILL NOT sync from Apple Watch and won‚Äôt even recognize you‚Äôre doing a run as it does with NTC. This app needs a lot of work when it comes to user interface. I repeat A LOT. I don‚Äôt understand if it‚Äôs merely bugs or lack of supporting software but it definitely is not user friendly. The most annoying thing that can happen during a run is having to stop and check on why the heck your music isn‚Äôt playing or why your heart rate isn‚Äôt being recorded. I‚Äôm better off running using the Apple Watch activity trackers than this very crappy app. Again the only good thing about it are the guided runs and tracking, but for that any simple podcast and software can do. 
I cannot recommend this app until it is made to support accessories that are specifically made for purposes such as running and fitness overall.
I have also read that there are much better options for runners out there but this app is def not it.IMPORTANT:. Note that most of the favorable reviews here DO NOT apply to using this app on the Apple Watch 3. For me and my friends in my running club, it has been a complete disaster. Despite repeated communications with Nike and assurances that the latest updates have fixed the problem, the app on the watch still crashes often, loses runs and data, and fails to sync with the iPhone and Nike site. Ironically, if you go into the native Apple activity and health apps on your iPhone, you'll discover that your Apple Watch is recording the data and transferring it to your iPhone.  It's the Nike App that seems to be the problem.  Some of my friends have claimed success with other apps on their Apple Watch, while others wear true running watches like Garmins or TomToms as backups. I lost two runs this weekend and will start doing the same. If you bought the Nike Edition of the Apple Watch 3 with LTE for running, you will be very disappointed. My TomTom does a better job tracking and syncing my runs with the Nike+ website than their own app.I‚Äôve been running the series 2 watch independently from the phone. The Nike app interface is sluggish.  On startup I usually get a green dot for a while then it crashes back to the watch face. I think the green dot might be meant to indicate that the app is trying to acquire position, but there are no words to say so. If I keep on restarting the app several times (more than 5) I can eventually get the app to start up completely. Today, halfway though the run, I discovered that the app was not tracking position. It thought I never moved. It also believed that I had no heart rate. It did time the run, but the watch didn‚Äôt sync the run with the phone app later.  Checking the activity app, I saw that the watch did indeed see my exercising heart rate but but it was not marked as a workout. Also, why won‚Äôt the watch app automatically start my music playlist like the phone app? Need to find a workout app for the watch that works, because this one certainly doesn‚Äôt work anymore.I seriously wanted to love this app... I can share with my running buddy, the challenges help motivate me to get my mileage in for the week, etc., BUT it keeps losing my runs! I get done with a run, it cheers me and tells me my run stats, but then completely disappears from my watch and phone app. This has happen numerous times over the past couple of weeks. It has also stopped recording in the middle of a 10 mile run, so I have to start a new run which throws off all of my metrics. Also, if I pause to re-tie my shoe it randomly unpauses and re-pauses on its own with very little movement, then when I start up again it doesn‚Äôt unpause to begin tracking again. Lastly, there have been a couple of instances where I started a run, ran at least 5 miles, only to find out that it stopped tracking my distance/route so at the end it says that I ran 0.1 miles in an hour.
Wayyy too many glitches considering I have only been using this app for 2 months. Super disappointed.Previously gave the app 3 stars because of issues with stopping runs during and being unable to pause or stop runs when I‚Äôm done because of sweat or rain. Now the app doesn‚Äôt work at all on my watch because it says location services aren‚Äôt enabled, which they are and I have no issues with location services on any other app. I can get it to track my run without location services if I start the run within 5-10 seconds of opening the app however it often will spontaneously stop tracking even after the countdown. Twice in a week I went for a run the app didn‚Äôt start correctly after giving me the countdown and missed the first 0.75 miles. My watch noticed I was running and suggested I start an outdoor run, which is why I even noticed it wasn‚Äôt tracking properly. 

Needs serious updates. Will check out Strava.I‚Äôve been using this app off and on since 2011 with no problems. Since yesterday, the app is suddenly completely wrong. This morning I ran a quick one mile route I‚Äôve run at least 10 times using this app; the distance that this app has told me is 0.5 miles, and which my boyfriend‚Äôs smart watch and Strava app tells him is 0.5 miles, is suddenly 0.3 miles this morning. Yesterday I ran a loop that I measured out on Google Maps as being almost exactly 1 mile, and yesterday it was 0.6 miles. Somehow in the update the GPS is no longer working accurately. I run fairly consistent 10.5 minute miles and today and yesterday my mile time was suddenly jacked up to 16.5 minute miles...I can walk faster than that. That‚Äôs obviously wrong, and it‚Äôs because the GPS isn‚Äôt tracking correctly. I‚Äôve done nothing different than usual so I don‚Äôt know why this is happening. I see some other people are having the same problem so it‚Äôs not just me. Please fix it!!I want to like this app because of the coaching feature, but the integration with the Apple Watch is incredibly unreliable. After one run that had been tracking just fine, when I tapped the screen to end my run it suddenly doubled my mileage. Suddenly my slow recovery run said I ran 4:30 minute miles, which was flattering but totally inaccurate. After a different run the watch app crashed after I paused the run but before I could press stop (the app frequently seems to have trouble with this). On this occasion it failed to record my run in my running history at all. Somehow it showed on the watch QuickStart list, but it didn‚Äôt show in my run history on the watch or in the app. If it wasn‚Äôt for coaching plans, I would have given up on this app. As it stands, at least they have a feature where you can edit and/or manually add runs so you can fix all the problems caused when the app messes up.This an an average app for run tracking and was designed for novice/off and on runners. My runs rarely synch with the app until after my next run. Some runs never synch, so I have to add them (big thanks to the Apple activity app for actually tracking my runs). The app crashes multiple times per week. The NRC app on my Nike+ Apple Watch S2 is extremely laggy and also crashes. It wasn‚Äôt like that when I first got the watch, but after a few NRC updates it began to freeze and crash. The My Coach feature is average at best. It doesn‚Äôt factor in warmup and cool down into your weekly mileage goals. It also doesn‚Äôt give you the option to customize your plan (after it has been created), aside from shifting days around within the same week. I‚Äôm giving this app 1 star because it drives me INSANE when my runs take days to synch when the Apple activity app synchs EVERY run immediately!The iPhone app has improved from the buggy mess it was at first release... but the Apple Watch app is now slower and more unreliable than ever. If I run with my phone with me, my Apple Watch used to just function as a second display, allowing me to view the stats on my current run. Now, the Watch app frequently freezes for a couple minutes and then ‚Äúforgets‚Äù that it‚Äôs showing me data for a run that my phone is tracking and starts tracking a new run by itself. I end up with two runs logged into the app‚Äî the one logged by the phone is fine, but the run logged by the Watch (despite it never being told to log a run) is all messed up because the Watch missed a long portion of the run while it was frozen. Once again, Nike disappoints with this garbage app. If I didn‚Äôt have so much data saved in it, I would‚Äôve moved on to something better a year ago.Do not use Nike Run Club with your Apple Watch if you want to actually track your runs. The app worked great for the first 3 months using it, but it has glitched the past 5 times that I have tried using it. When I finish, the run that I just completed disappears. Today was the last straw, as I hit a PR long run and when I ended the run on my watch, it was gone. So frustrating. Also, I can confidently say that it is not my watch, as the Workout app tracks my runs just fine every time. I only used NRC for the social aspect, tracking mileage on my shoes, and the occasional guided run, but it is not worth it since I have to enter each run manually now and I lose all heart rate, route, and pace data. Just as a side note, I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app prior to this run hoping that it would help the glitching problem, but obviously it did not.I have been using NRC for the past 2 years and loved it. I have used it on both my Apple Watch 4 (cell and GPS) and the iPhone 8. Everything was great for outdoor runs and although it was inaccurate on the treadmill, that didn‚Äôt bother me too much as those runs were usually short. The problem I have now is for runs over 10 miles it does not track accurately. The app will stop tracking and restart the run when I lift the watch. The weird thing is that it does not start a new run but will continue from whatever distance it decided to stop at. This is a big pain when trying to get accurate splits and pace while training. I can tell you that if you are a serious runner who wants in depth metrics, go with a garmin and their app. I have buddy who uses the Fenix 3 and the stats and data he gets back post run are amazing. I will be switching to a forerunner soon.After close to 3 years of using this app there are some reasons to use this app, although most of them will be available on many others as well, things like tracking your run with GPS, guided runs and weekly challenges. The main reason not to use this app is the horrible run syncing and intermittent  crashing that will leave you refreshing your app for up to 20 minutes just to sync a run, or should you be lucky enough your app will just crash mid run and you will have no recourse but to forget it ever happened and you will lose any progress you might have made. If the horrid syncing issue and crashing isn‚Äôt enough, you will never win or come close to finishing top 10 in your weekly or monthly challenges because some guy on a bicycle is going to log 1400 miles in a week and will be first place.I loved this app over a year ago.  I bought a Nike Ô£øwatch series 3.  It was always reliable and did awesome at tracking and syncing with phone.  It actually helped me to start running regular and consistently.  Fast forward to the last few months and upgrades.  I can never get this watch to sync with my IPhone X.  I‚Äôm always looking for a new update and hoping the latest one will fix.  It never does and all support ever tells you is to delete app and reinstall.  I‚Äôve done that at least over 20 times.  I no longer start my runs with the watch cause they won‚Äôt sync with phone and count toward goals.  So you just use phone.  Sadly I‚Äôm to the point of moving on to another way to track besides Nike.  The app was good but anymore it has turned into a lite version of the Nike sell you something app.  Nike you had a good thing going and let it run away from ya.I‚Äôve used this app for almost a year and had some good times on it. Sure, there were some annoying this (why do I have to manually post each run to my feed, and why does it auto save my pictures to my camera roll), but nothing I couldn‚Äôt live with. About a month ago it started mistracking my distance, it would count a mile at .70! Ridiculous. I would have to delete and re-add, and it would work correctly for a run or two. Even that stopped working and now it‚Äôs just a complete trash app that fails at doing the one thing it was supposed to do. I know it‚Äôs not a phone issue - I‚Äôve used multiple phones!

I‚Äôve reached out to Nike on Twitter multiple times about this issue and they even went as far as to send me an initial email, but have since left me alone.

I was hesitant to leave the app and my run history, but I‚Äôm done. Later NRC!I did not used to use this app. I used to use the Apple ‚ÄúRings‚Äù app that coincides with the Apple Watch. I only switched to the NRC app because my friends that do not have an Apple Watch wanted me to compete in a 50 mile challenge.

The app started out working fine and counted all of my runs immediately after I got done with them. Then after about a week or 2, they started ‚Äúlagging‚Äù meaning they would not count my runs immediately after I completed it, but rather a day after completion. I didn‚Äôt mind this because it was still tracking my runs and I was still in 1st place. Unfortunately, recently this past week, NRC has not counted my runs at all. When I complete a run and press the stop button on my watch, it just freezes for a second and exits to my Apple Watch home screen. Usually it would say a motivational quote or something and then show you what you did and where you went. None of that is showing anymore. 

I am deleting this app and reverting back to the Apple Rings app as that is much more reliable and does not run the risk of losing count of you‚Äôre runs when it might be required to provide proof of your running.

Very disappointed Nike...VERY.I wanted to love this app because I love Nike and their products, however, this app is ALWAYS crashing on me. I have an IPhone X and a fairly new Apple Watch, and somehow there is always some sort of delay/glitch/crash with this app and it‚Äôs very frustrating. This morning was the last straw, when I ran my BEST pace since I started running and after I paused the run to stop it and save it, it crashed and didn‚Äôt save my run! This is not the first time, as it always lags when going to pause/stop/resume a run. You need to get it together and fix this because I am serious about tracking my runs and every mile counts, and there are so many unrecorded miles that I have because of how poorly designed this app is. I am thoroughly annoyed and disappointed in Nike for this terrible product.I‚Äôve contacted them, but have got no response. My miles aren‚Äôt tracking correctly. Says xx miles on the weekly 15k (which aren‚Äôt accurate if you look at my logged miles), then shows different set of miles for the October 50k and 100k. Started logging on October 5th, so all miles should count for October. So why are they different? 
It seems it either doesn‚Äôt log my miles correctly, or shows different miles in different locations, in my challenges....??? 

I‚Äôve deleted app, power cycled phone, and watch....still is all messed up. I have several friends who no longer use the app because it‚Äôs been an ongoing issue for well over a year. 

Sadly I have downloaded 3 other apps and those work much better, so if not fixed, I will be another user that‚Äôs gone and deleted the app. Nike! You‚Äôre losing people....please fix your bugs and issues....it‚Äôs been well over a year???? Really? You‚Äôve got more than enough money and resources to fix this. When I search online, I see more and more people complaining about your app....wow....that‚Äôs not a good thing for business! 

Please fix this stuff! Really, truly fix it.I‚Äôm not sure what is going on but when I ran yesterday my tracking was way off.  Where I was at a mile it showed I was at .20 Today I updated the app thinking maybe they new about it. Tried again now with another running app in the background. Same exact issue. Also it was very annoying. Every 5 sec I heard ‚Äúpausing workout, resuming workout‚Äù. The other app tracked my running no problems. I really like the nrc app I have been using it for years. I do want to point out that I had no problems with my Samsung phone. I just switched to iPhone so it might be a problem with iOS only. I will delete and reinstall the app and give it another shot. Maybe something got lost in translation. If it is fixed I will edit my review.Very disappointed with NRC app and each update. I really enjoyed this app in the beginning and have logged over 1800 miles on it but it seems the app declines with each update. 

Most recently, I updated the app the day before my half marathon race for which I had been training. On race day I started the app with my race and two miles in realized it hadn‚Äôt been tracking even though it did the normal countdown and indicated it was tracking when I first launched it at the start. On my run two days later the app again failed to track the first mile of my run after I started the app.

I would hate to switch to a different app after logging so many runs with this one, but it seems Nike has failed to fulfill its sole purpose with this app‚Äîactually tracking runs. Very disappointed.In the nicest way I can possibly say this, please just stop updating. Since the last update, the app can no longer track my runs properly- it somehow manages to stop tracking me about halfway through my run and then seems to just guesstimate my total distance and pace the rest of the way. At the end, on my summary, I‚Äôm left with a map of half my run and totally unreliable stats. NOTHING has changed with my phone, mobile carrier, cell reception in my area. 

Lastly, is there some place where I can see my history of PR times (best 5k, best 10K, etc...)? Before the ‚ÄúUpdate We Don‚Äôt Speak Of‚Äù a year ago, I was able to at least scroll back through my activity log and see previous best times so I could see my progress. Well, that‚Äôs gone, so thanks for taking away one of my motivations.I have had multiple runs disappear and not sync to the app once I pause the run and try to end it. This is not an isolated incident with this app. Some of my best mile times/fastest runs have not registered on the app and it makes it difficult to continue to track progress over time ‚Äî makes me think I should just use the apple workout app instead because although it doesn‚Äôt allow for gps tracking, it does ALWAYS register a workout for you and it never disappears. Nike should either work to fix this bug or create some kind of back door way to recover your workout so it can be recorded and figured into your overall averages without you having to manually enter run time and number of miles.A good running app has one job: tracking your runs. It can provide you with a million other bells and whistles, but if it can‚Äôt execute its primary task flawlessly, it‚Äôs a failure. Nike has tried too hard to add functions to this app that it‚Äôs forgotten its basic function. 

I‚Äôve used this app for the past five years, and it‚Äôs given me more problems in the last 3 months than the entire time before. It‚Äôll crash multiple times on start up, take almost a minute to load, and it‚Äôs crashed at least three times mid-run. There‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than looking down to see how far you‚Äôve gone and realize the app stopped tracking you a mile ago. 

I love Nike, but it‚Äôs gotta execute at its basic functions, and it‚Äôs forgotten that recently.I started a 5k running plan a few weeks ago. I ran a benchmark run last week but The app never saved for that day so my plan didn‚Äôt adapt like it was supposed to based on previous runs and because it occurred last week there is no way to retroactively fix it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I really want to love this app. As a United States Marine, part of my physical fitness test is a three mile run. I really wanted to use this app and it‚Äôs adaptive algorithms to improve my fitness score. However this is not possible with this app. One day my runs are listed in the schedule as completed the next they are erased and there‚Äôs no way to fix it because it occurs after the week has closed out. I expected better from Nike and it‚Äôs application development team.Unreliable for tracking runs on Apple Watch 3. Sometimes it provides GPS maps, but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.  Apple blames Nike, Nike is unresponsive. Might as well use the Apple workout app, and pair with Strava or other reliable app.  As far as performance data, the app falls short in allowing you to see where you have improved or are falling short. The graphics are extremely difficult to see when trying to determine if HR is impacted by pace or elevation.  I guess you can use your desktop computer and upload to Nike site to better analyze, but not on your phone or the watch. 

Annoyed, and disappointed in Apple and Nike. Polar and Garmin have been doing these apps for decades, and their superiority in sports watches is glaringly obvious.GPS/location function stopped working when starting a run, and there‚Äôs no way to know that it isn‚Äôt working until I‚Äôve already started. It suddenly starts tracking somewhere in the 2nd mile of my run. Never had issues before (I‚Äôve been using it since ~2012, nothing has changed on my end). Now it isn‚Äôt even usable. Now I just use the stopwatch function on my phone and take a screenshot approximately every mile to figure out pace, which works, but is frustrating.

PS: I have confirmed that outdoor is turned on. 

I also have issues where the run will suddenly disappear as soon as I end it, the app keeps changing my weight to 350 lbs at random, and it pauses intermittently without me pressing pause (auto start/stop is off).I have been a Nike run app user for years. I actually paid money for the app it‚Äôs been so long ago. Over those years I have enjoyed challenging myself and my friends by tracking my miles. It feels good to be at the top of the leader board. Also over those years I have seen good versions of the app and bad versions of the app. Lately it seems it is going from bad versions to worse versions. As it stands this week alone I have lost half of my runs. Today I had to leave the phone open to the app the whole time I ran. On a longer run this would make the app useless. At this point I would not recommend Nike running app to anyone. Find a better way to track your miles. I‚Äôm in too deep‚Äîsave yourself!!I used this app for over five years and it was perfect! The last year or so, about 90% of my runs don‚Äôt track with the GPS. I‚Äôve updated every time there‚Äôs an update, and I‚Äôve disconnected it from my Apple Watch since I don‚Äôt run with it, but nothing seems to help. It has been beyond frustrating and I keep thinking with every update they will fix the problem. It usually works for a few runs and then suddenly just stops tracking with GPS.  I run with it on my stroller so it doesn‚Äôt go off of the arm swings. If I run with it in my arm band it will track. I always make sure it is set to outdoor and completely shut down the app and re-open it but it still won‚Äôt track.First day it wouldn‚Äôt sync with my watch, it tracked my route, but not my distance - 1.5 mi was logged as .31. It also kept pausing workout every 2 seconds.  I turned off auto pause but it didn‚Äôt help the distance issue. 
The next day I ran with my stroller. I got my phone and watch to sync but If phone was sitting in stroller holder, it stopped tracking distance on both devices. I tried pushing double stroller with one arm to see if my arm swings would help. Nope. The only way it would track is if I was holding my phone and my watch was running. Not practical for running with a double stroller and 2 kids. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard. Going back to using Apple Watch workout app- outdoor run.10/17 update
The core feature, tracking runs, is sadly still inconsistent and broken. I start the app on my phone and then use my Apple Watch series 3 to control music during runs; that combo somehow causes the app to pause runs indefinitely or crash. Pretty brutal if you lose long runs like I do every week or so. Strava app never has s problem. 

10/16 update
The core feature, tracking runs, is still inconsistent and broken. I started a normal run holding the phone. Countdown was going, so I locked the phone and slipped it into my pocket. 30 minutes later, I realize the app closed / crashed and didn't track the run. I'd recommend double checking that every run is going with the new app. 

First release of new app
Run tracking with the Apple Watch is a mess now. Not sure what's going on, but the app no longer seems to play nice with the Watch's Activity app. I used to start both for a run, and everything was good to go. Now they conflict with each other. Hosed my run tracking tonight. Can't figure out what is going on when.Even worse than the review below. This app is so glitchy. Today I ran for 50 minutes, and it kept saying ‚Äúresuming workout‚Äù the entire time. I finished having run .48 km according to this app. I edited it based on data from my health app, but my edited totals won‚Äôt be added to my overall distance, which I like to track just for my own benefit. Come on Nike. Fix this soon. I‚Äôm on the lookout for something better.

I love the basic thing the app does... when it does it. Too often, though, I push start, the screen goes black, and the app crashes. I might need to find a way to export my data to a different mileage tracking app, but I hope developers fix the bug before I need to.I‚Äôve been a member since January 2012. 

I‚Äôve enjoyed being able to track my runs on the Nike+ App this whole time. But every run lately has seemed to be an issue. The app takes forever to load on the Watch, glitches often before, during, and after runs. Sometimes crashing post run then restarting and says, ‚ÄúBeginning Workout‚Äù which believes I‚Äôm starting to run again, then just packs on time but no distance while I‚Äôm trying to get it to stop. 

The latest issue that I‚Äôve run into is that the Watch and Phone Apps no longer talk, hence no updates appear on my phone, and it is missing previous runs. Nike contact lacks the ability to fully address these concerns due to my location not being in the US. 

The Watch app still never plays the music stored on my watch, so being that it never worked, I don‚Äôt care much about it.

I too WILL NO LONGER USE NIKE+, and will switch to STRAVA for tracking of my runs. Any questions, please let me know, or corrective actions you think I should‚Äôve taken.I had to give it one star because it works sometimes. I've had it for almost a year. Unreliable at first. Would stop tracking and just crash. Reinstalled many times.  I gave up. I used the Apple app and although it is basic, unlike the Nike app, works all the time. I started using the Nike app in the past few months and seemed to work fine until the past couple of weeks. Again, I get to hear Allison Felix tell me what a great run I did when I'm actually still running. I ran 8 miles today and the app quit 5 times. I get the famous ""workout complete"" and I didn't touch anything. Back to unreliable.  Nike needs to stick to clothes and let the pros handle apps and golf.",0,"STILL, YES, STILL GARBAGEYOU WILL LOSE YOUR RUNSBewareApple workout app is betterLatest Update Messed Up Mile TrackingDefective guided runs with watch and why no iMessage support?Two stars for variety and new contentDoes Not Work with Apple Watch 3 LTEKeeps crashing on startup!Wanted to love thisLocation services doesn‚Äôt work (and it‚Äôs turned on and works for every other app)Used to Love this AppBuggy AppNeeds bug fixes and improvementsApple Watch app is getting worseNRC with Apple WatchNot accurate on longer runsMehRan into the dirt!Used to WorkRuns are not counted using the Apple Watch (series 3)Constantly crashing, not saving runs, lag time.About to delete and use a new run appTracking way offDisappointedPlease stop updating.

I have been consistently using the app for the last two months. While it works well most of time but if you are long distance runner and want to track more than 12 or 14 miles the app is becoming unreliable. Today was worst. I started the run in the watch waited for the count down and stared running. Good 7 or 8 mins into my run I check the watch only to find the watch showing me the time as though I didn‚Äôt start. I press the app again only to find the app simply spinning on watch. I pulled out the phone and the Nike app said you have a run in watch. At this point my rhythm is gone I stop trying to figure out what is happening. Finally started the app again on the phone and started running. Now Nike assumes I have a 3k goal. Luckily it didn‚Äôt stop after 3k. 
I lost 0.7 mile of the tracking. Lost my rhythm on run. Ended up running more than my goal(ok that‚Äôs fine) but dealing with a buggy app in the middle of the run is super frustrating. Nike, just do it...right. Until then I have to switch to something else. After spending to get a Nike Apple Watch I feel let down in trust and reliability.  
Hope you read this and sure you have access to my data and fix it.I have been a Nike+ run user since the days of the step counting pedometer accessory Nike marketed for use with early iPhone and iPod‚Äôs.  I have generally been very satisfied with the apps features and reliability, but have always been wary of updating to the latest app version, as Nike seems unequipped to properly beta test updates for sync functionality.    

After an Apple forced WatchOS update, the iPhone app no longer synced with the Apple Watch. Though I dreaded updating to the latest app version, I did it and instantly regretted it.  The app displayed a week‚Äôs worth of run data but all runs had a ‚Äúsync error‚Äù and would not count into my monthly or cumulative tally.  Deleting the app and reinstalling as recommended in the Nike FAQ resulted in the Watch also deleting a weeks worth of runs.  Apple Activity app has a record of the runs but not the NRC app that acquired that run data.

I am fed up with poor Nike app reliability, time for a new run tracking app that allows me to backup my data.  Lately my run miles are hard earned after having COVID-19 in March 2020, I struggle to gain back my pace /endurance still 4 months later, and this losing of my run data adds nothing but insult to injuryThis app is great for tracking runs, but what I don‚Äôt like is that they took away some things that were great about the app. 
1. Show friends level and/or miles. One of the most driving things is to not be outdone by your friends. People work hard to get to a certain level. What‚Äôs the point if nobody can see it but you?
Bring back challenges. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre gone completely or just hidden, but challenges were fun! It gets people moving who may not be moving. 
I‚Äôm not with all of the social stuff with strangers. I think the app is going in a direction of social media, but taking away from the social part of friends interacting with friends. I don‚Äôt see a need to share pictures of my run with strangers who could care less, just as I could care less about theirs. 
I also miss the part where we could get cheers from Facebook. That was motivation on your run. I used it all of the time. Then it was messed up where it posted a picture on my Facebook and and didn‚Äôt shut down the post when I was done running so people could comment on it all day....instead of just fixing that, I guess they just took that feature away completely.Nike, while I love keeping track of my data with you, I‚Äôd love you to PLEASE include some of the additional tracking metrics, or at least pass through these metrics to workout; Splits, Power, Cadence, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, stride length. These are things I‚Äôd love to see included and trackable through Fitness. I‚Äôm happy to keep using NRC for run tracking, but if you don‚Äôt include these, I‚Äôll need to look elsewhere for tracking.

Also including this old request, as it‚Äôs still missing. 

 Personal Achievements now don‚Äôt include the TIME, which is kind of the point of the achievement. Not sure why this was removed, but it should be a key component of that screen instead of looking the same blank Black/green with a new date. That‚Äôs not useful. While we‚Äôre on the subject, could you add HISTORICAL achievement dates/times/distances? You already have all this data, but given you promote this as a way to improve, it would be great to actually see and compare my data over time, instead of having to manually note it in the Notes app. Show us data that matters to us as runners please.I used to swear by this app and loved using it to train for races. When the first big update came last fall I remember being shocked because the app deleted my whole training plan for the marathon I was 3 months into training for. Apparently enough people complained that they offered the option for people to restore the plan from the pre-update app so that solved my problem for the time being.

I‚Äôm now starting training for another marathon and while I wanted to use this app for the training, I found it impossible.  having me run 1-2 miles 2 days a week, doing one day of sprints, and then out of nowhere busting out a long run once a week doesn‚Äôt seem like the best way to build endurance or create a healthy foundation. I get that they are trying to be creative and add in more variety/tracking with the speed and benchmark runs but I feel like they‚Äôre more of a waste than a benefit.

I wish there was a way to still use older versions of the training plans because I haven‚Äôt experienced any of the glitchiness so many others have and would definitely continue using the app if that were the case.The idea behind this app is great ‚Äî my friends and family use is to create running challenges and then to compete against each other. It‚Äôs a fun way to get in those miles. 

BUT ‚Äî and this is a huge ‚Äúbut‚Äù ‚Äî the distance tracker built into the app is wildly inconsistent and inaccurate. It often under-counts my distance by as much as .25-.5 miles for every mile I run ... but then will randomly get the mileage right, without my  doing anything different. It might not sound like a lot in small increments, but when you run four miles and get credit for only three, it‚Äôs super annoying, especially when you‚Äôre in a competition for miles. In contrast, my treadmill, MapMyRun and Garmin are usually all within .1 miles of each other. 

So here‚Äôs my takeaway:  if you have a device that pairs with the app (a Garmin, shoes, etc.), this app might be for you (note that other apps with better distance tracking, like MapMyRun, don‚Äôt pair with this one). But if you will be relying on the app itself to track your progress, don‚Äôt bother. The progress tracker is so inaccurate, you will just end up frustrated.This app is pretty awesome when using for short runs or every time I used it when Im not racing....however for both my 15k and full marathon the watch app just stopped and took forever to come back up and/or kept restarting. For my 15k I used my watch app around the 10k mark to turn the song and the entire run stopped and took forever to come back up so I lost almost a mile in bike run club Nd didn‚Äôt get credit for my challenge. During my marathon the watch app stopped tracking about mile 20 when I received a text on my watch. It took forever to come back up and then kept restarting the entire time after that. I also didn‚Äôt get the credit in Nike Run club for a full marathon. The runs I care about tracking aren‚Äôt being tracked! I haven‚Äôt been able to stop the marathon I did today because it keeps freezing and restarting. It‚Äôs been 6 hours. I also lost 2.2 miles. 

I loved this app and didn‚Äôt want to switch over but I don‚Äôt plan to use it for much longer if the bugs aren‚Äôt fixed. I only gave 2 stars due to past years of use.This is reliable and its interface while running is good in keeping it simple enough yet tracking sufficient data. It just hasn‚Äôt changed in a while, lacks social components of others, and metrics of other apps. There‚Äôs a vast coaching library but the narrators get annoying since most of the time you don‚Äôt want to hear someone talking in your ear about your run.  I‚Äôve found the running program for marathon horrible and that may apply to the other training programs. It lacked a holistic approach, lacked sufficient workouts (even with cross-training) and left me in my worst shape ever for a marathon.  After making Volt level, I was personally dismayed that NRC no longer even makes an acknowledgment of the accomplishment, at least for Volt. After getting so bummed that Nike didn‚Äôt even acknowledgment my 14-year quest, I‚Äôve dropped them and have happily discovered some other greats apps. Please keep shopping around before considering NRC. I‚Äôve used them for more than 10 years but now realize how much I missed out from other apps. You aren‚Äôt married to NRC.Have used this app for several months and it is becoming progressively more glitchy. 
App on phone is not syncing with app on my Apple Watch. When I start a run on my phone, it used to automatically start the run on my watch, but now it no longer does so. I also have to restart my watch literally every single day before launching the Nike run app because otherwise it won‚Äôt even let me start a run (start button completely unresponsive). This is super inconvenient because if I don‚Äôt remember to restart my watch until I‚Äôm about to start running, I have to delay my run by several minutes waiting for the watch to reboot. App will often freeze on my watch when I try to toggle between indoors and outdoors runs. During my last long run, the app on my watch quit itself multiple times and I thought I had lost 19+ miles of data; I re-opened the app and thankfully it started where I had left off, but why does it have to close by itself? 
Getting quite frustrated by the lagging and glitches and considering switching to a different system for tracking my runs.I‚Äôve been using this app since 2012. As the tech evolves, there have always been glitches that I was willing to ignore because the basic functionality was OK. For example, the watch and app have problems syncing or shifting music from one device to the other, or GPS and tracking, etc. There have always been synchronization issues between Apple watch and phone. 

This summer I reached the limits of my patience and am now confident giving this app 2 stars. I lost over a 20 runs and the only solution Nike gives me is to send them the data so they can upload manually. I can do that too!!

The app does not effectively record the data associated with runs. Forget about workouts, guided runs, interphase or incentives to buy Nike products. If you are looking for an app that effectively registers the data of your runs, look for something else. I was patient for years waiting for a definite fix but every year, sometimes several times a year, I lose very significant data and time. I get not being able to sync, but them losing your data altogether?I wish this app worked the way it is supposed to because it could be perfect. I really enjoy the programs and guided runs and the way the app keeps track of your best times and other stats. However, since many runs don‚Äôt get recorded in the app for now particular reason it makes the stats pretty inaccurate. It is a regular occurrence that I will do a guided run using NRC on my Apple Watch, the run will be imported into my Apple fitness app and shows up there, but it never shows up in my NRC app and all the data on my splits etc. is gone forever. I have reached out to support on this and it is definitely a known issue but it keeps happening. It takes forever to download guided runs onto the watch and it‚Äôs a glitchy process too. It is rare that I don‚Äôt encounter an issue when using the app. If they would fix these known issues with the app it could be the best run tracking app out there but since they won‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it if you care about keeping your run data accurate.I really want to like this app, but it has serious syncing issues. I‚Äôm currently using a MY COACH program and after each run you‚Äôre asked to rate the intensity and specify where you ran - great.  And the next time you open the MY COACH it‚Äôs ready for you to begin the next run - also great.

But you‚Äôll notice a notification within your general run summary that a run needs your attention (asking you to rate it and specify location); it‚Äôs the previous run that‚Äôs part of your coached program and that you‚Äôve already rated. Whatever, rate it again, right? Wrong. Doing so removes it from your plan as if it never occurred - treats it as just a regular run. Sure you can edit and re-assign it to your program but it will not count toward your overall goal, won‚Äôt be measured against your progress and won‚Äôt be counted towards achievements.

If you‚Äôre serious about tracking then look elsewhere.updating review from 1y ago:

notes are back (thank you!) and the new design is really nice. I‚Äôve just switched to iPhone X and it was a pleasant surprise that the app is already optimized for it.

With that being said, I turned it on and started running, as always, but as I wasn‚Äôt listening to the feedback I set it up after a few minutes, I checked and as I unlocked my phone, the countdown started again, time was running from when I originally started but the distance was not. I turned it off, took a break and restarted it. Made sure the countdown was over and it was tracking before putting it in my pocket again and a couple of minutes later voila; no feedback. it did the same thing. I really like this app and can‚Äôt wait for it to properly track my runs again! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

Hopefully the massive amounts of poor reviews will have a positive effect on the upcoming updates. I don't think we could be any louder about how disappointing the new app is.

The social media aspect is overwhelming, the badges - which were a big source of motivation for me - were taken away, and the calibration seems off since all of a sudden my pace is way higher than it used to be for no reason. I also miss the Note feature (adding a title to the run sounds a little random/pointless). 
I would love to have more of the old app back, less Instagram-ish please.Really, what happened, Nike? I‚Äôve been using this app for over a year now and it‚Äôs always been my favorite- it‚Äôs got great features; you‚Äôre able to see your splits every kilometer, accurate GPS tracking, and it records the mileage you put on every pair of your running shoes. Etc. these are all things I love. And those are all things that I, upon opening the app, 97% OF THE TIME, can not access simply because the app freezes over, I can tap on my screen and nothing responds, and after about 20 or so seconds of complete inactivity the app just crashes. Im moving to another app now. Nike, please fix this. Adding new features such as guided runs and challenges are great but go do that once you fix the most basic functionalities. Or get rid of those extra features, even, if it means the app can finally run smoothly. You‚Äôre losing users, Nike, please fix these issues before you lose more. Sincerely.The Apple Watch controls to pause or stop your run are too close together and, unlike on the phone app version, you do not need to hold down the stop button to end your run. This is extremely frustrating and poor design that can very easily be fixed. Multiple times I have wanted to pause while running and glanced the stop button by accident because I am moving and once that button is touched you cannot continue tracking the run. It is done. No undo, you can only start a new run. Intensely deflating when you are deep into a run. PLEASE keep the controls consistent and make the Apple Watch app require you to hold down the stop button to end a run the same way you have to on the phone version. You clearly understand the need and benefit of this, which is why you put it in the phone app. All I ask is you apply the same good sense to all platforms.Used to be a great app, but no longer. 

App doesn‚Äôt tag a run as a plan workouts automatically like before. No idea if this is intentional or not, but now one must manually designate a run was a plan workout after the fact, or the workout is listed as incomplete. Oftentimes these manual edits still won‚Äôt save and you have to re-enter your information multiple times before it finally saves.

 Feedback entered after workouts (run difficulty on the 1-10 scale, other info you can add) doesn‚Äôt log either, so when manually editing runs like above, info needs to be re-entered a second time, if not more.

No rest timer on sprint/interval workouts, and multiple button presses are needed to pause timer on a split /end lap. Previous versions, you hit the pause button and rest timer automatically started. Hit the button again to start next split. Simple and elegant. This process is now complicated and unintuitive.

GPS tracking is fairly inconsistent. Running the exact same one mile route will give different distances every time, sometimes overestimating, sometimes underestimating it but as much as .15 of a mile.

This app was great two or three versions ago, now it‚Äôs bloated, overly complex, and unreliableI‚Äôm surprised to see so many high ratings for this app. I used this app religiously for every run before I got my Apple Watch. It worked great. Since using the Apple Watch for a year now it started off ok. Some bugs here and there but the main things, gps, split time tracking all worked fine. As I continue to use this app and get later and later releases, it works less and less. It‚Äôs now to the point I have to manually input most runs. If I run over 10 miles it‚Äôs almost guaranteed. Awful. The app now takes forever to open (if it doesn‚Äôt crash beforehand) and then when my run is finished the pause and stop buttons might not work, causing the app to crash and me losing multiple mile runs. It‚Äôs become terrible. And I have a lot of history with this app so it‚Äôs very disappointing. I hope Nike figures things out quickly...I have been using the Nike apps for years and then this app. What happened over the past few days?  It barely records my runs anywhere near accuracy at all. I might as well be going backwards up a hill at turtle speed!  I have been indoors on my treadmill and I'm at the point of throwing my iPhone onto the floor from this aggravating app.  But why ruin my phone over this asinine app?  I am over this and will have to record manually until Nike fixes this.

I have been tracking my runs with this app for so many years.   I have logged over 12,200 miles. 
Every day when I‚Äôm done after an hour, instead of
registering my 5.25 to 5.50 miles, it registers like 3.48 which I know is wrong.  My treadmill records it correctly and I am forced to edit my run in the app.  By the way, this might be since the iPhone XR‚Äôs last update.I‚Äôve used this app for over 10 years. I love tracking all my metrics in one place and even though there are periodic glitches it has largely kept me interested it my fitness‚Äî with one glaring exception.

Coach Bennett is absolutely insufferable. He lingers on his own jokes for way too long and most runs that he coaches I feel like I am listening to a 5-year-old just making up words to fill in the dead air space. I‚Äôve even taken to shouting very loudly ‚Äúshut up shut up shut up!‚Äù when I‚Äôm out in public, which has turned a few heads. I haven‚Äôt figured out a way to turn off guided audio midrun, so I‚Äôve had to cut quite a few short because of him. Every other athlete and coach is great..except him. Please feature other coaches WAY more‚Ä¶and consider hiring him an editor, PLEASE!I don't have these issues with my other apps that communicate between my phone and my watch (series 2) which leads me to believe it‚Äôs the Nike+Run app. I simply cannot use the watch app. When the app is running on my phone it used to queue up the app on the watch and display my run there. It doesn‚Äôt do this anymore *at all*. Sometimes the watch app will get a wild hair and start tracking a run in the middle of a run that is already going on my watch & I will have to go in later to delete the errant run data. Sometimes the app will try to track a run a hour after I‚Äôve ended a run and I have to do a hard end of the session by completely closing the app on my watch. I really do like the app but I want so badly for this thing to communicate with my watch and it just doesn‚Äôt!I have been using the Nike Run Club app for my workout for years now, but the recent changes have me looking at other apps. Specifically:
Treadmill tracking: In the winter, I run inside on a treadmill or indoor track. In both cases, the app on both the iPhone and Apple Watch are lagging on distance tracking, typically averaging .25-.5 miles behind. I didn‚Äôt used to have this issue and the distance would only differ by about 0.02 miles on average. 

Music streaming: Specifically, on the Apple Watch, losing the music controls during runs has been very frustrating, especially the option to select a power song to finish a run. Bring the mucus controls back to Apple Watch and allow it to control Apple Music through the Nike Run Club App!After having used this app for four weeks, I am definitely disappointed.  It‚Äôs OK for just tracking regular runs - but the app bills itself as a training or coaching app.  The ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù plan seems cool, and throws a variety of runs at you, but good luck getting them to register as ‚Äúdone‚Äù in your plan.  You also can‚Äôt start the next run in your plan from your watch, so forget leaving your phone at home.  ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù interval runs don‚Äôt even mirror to the watch, which wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world except that there is NO voice feedback for when to rest or resume on these runs.  So if none of these things work reliably, what‚Äôs the point of using this app over any of the numerous other running apps?Let me start off saying I honestly love this app, the way it records your runs and the interface is really nice. All that said I started a coaching plan to run a marathon next year, I have successfully done 1 week worth of running that shows up in my run history but the coach will not give me credit for completing. I made sure to start the runs through the coach and it does everything as it should while I‚Äôm running but afterwards it will not check it off my list. I do love the app for the running tracking aspect but now I will have to try to start over and see if it will give me credit this time, unless support can contact me with a fix. So 5 star tracking app, but as of right now 1 star coaching app.So I‚Äôve had this app for about 3 weeks now. I downloaded it to set up and track a marathon running plan.  I downloaded it for my iPhone and Apple Watch and then created my plan. The huge problem is that you can‚Äôt get to your plan (‚Äúmy coach‚Äù) from you watch. You can only access it from your phone. That means if you want to follow your plan, you have to have your phone with you when you run. No thanks. There are ‚Äúguided runs‚Äù available, but not the custom running plan that is set up on your phone‚Äôs app. It‚Äôs really frustrating! 
I will say that it does a great job of tracking runs and even your shoe mileage. However, making me have my phone in order to use my marathon plan is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm out.I‚Äôve been using the NRC app for a few weeks to track my runs. I have been doing a lot more treadmill runs lately and have noticed that I cannot start the run on my phone and use my watch to track distance. It will only track distance when carrying my phone. If I start the run on my watch it tracks distance fine while on the treadmill. (It is not consistent with the treadmill readings, but that is a known issue with accelerometer tracking). I like to have my phone set on the treadmill to make it easier to see my pace and heart rate. I have read some reviews from a year ago mentioning the same problem. Disappointing that this hasn‚Äôt Been fixed yet.I am reviewing the Apple Watch version of this app, running on a Series 2. I love it when it works, which makes it all the more frustrating on the countless occasions it doesn‚Äôt work. 

Sometimes the app will go through several minutes of loading, restarting, loading, and restarting before you get the option to start a run. 

Other times it looks like it has started a run, only to look at it a few minutes in and find out it isn‚Äôt tracking anything (no time/distance change). 

Last big problem is usually at the end of a run, where the app will suddenly crash and take you back to the watch face. If you are lucky, you can reopen it and after a few cycles of crashes/relaunches you‚Äôll get back to your run to stop it. If you‚Äôre unlucky you just have to wait a few hours for it to show up in your activity log in the iPhone app. 

The guided runs are a wonderful addition, and this is my preferred running app, but it has all become so unreliable that I doubt I will be using it much longer if Nike can‚Äôt sort it out.I‚Äôd like to give this app a better score but, after running 176 miles with it, it needs some work. The biggest issue is stability. It frequently crashes when using the Apple Watch. In some cases, it loses all your running data. This really defeats the entire point of the watch and app. It also takes several tries to get the app to launch on the Apple Watch. Typically, performance on the iPhone is better but, just yesterday, while trying to save my run data, the app crashed on my phone and all my data was lost. I couldn‚Äôt even log back into the app on my phone! It‚Äôs performance related issues such as this that have me looking for a better app.Decided to log all my training for the marine corp marathon on the app. Strava had been my go to. I was using the app through my Apple Watch series 2 where you can use without a phone. Couple issues 1 - The splits always messed whenever I ran more than 10 miles for example I did an 18 miler but the app only gave me 15 splits one being for 30+ mins. 2 - tracking delayed after hitting the start button. On some runs it actually didn't start tracking to 1/8 - 1/4 mile into the run. So sent to messages within the app to customer service and received NO response. Now back to Strava and absolutely no problem. Shame such a huge sports company gets put to shame by little Strava.I have used this app to track my runs for 7 years. I like the guided runs and being able to track my runs. That‚Äôs the only reason I have used this app for that long. This app has stopped tracking my runs right. My pace on this app has been off anywhere from 1-7 minutes for every mile which is horrible when u are actually running a 9, 10-11 minute mile and it shows anywhere from 12-18 minutes for each mile. The faster I run the slower my pace which makes no sense that is ridiculous and I‚Äôm just about done with this app. My pace and mileage have been way off for the last month I‚Äôm not sure what you guys did but it needs fixedI use my Apple Watch series 3 and the app on my iPhone Xs. When everything works as advertised, it‚Äôs great. Unfortunately over the past month I‚Äôve noticed that about every 6th run doesn‚Äôt sync from my watch to the app. I‚Äôm in a competition through work so it‚Äôs frustrating to not get credit for my miles logged. Competition ends today and I haven‚Äôt been convinced to stick with this app vs. tracking with the Apple workouts app. In the grand scheme of life this is incredibly minor and there are much larger issues like innocent people being murdered simply because of the color of their skin... but I‚Äôm competitive and I also get asked to write a review every time I open the app. So yaBeen a Nike fan my whole life‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm so disappointed. With all the money and resources Nike has‚Ä¶ they should really have a smooth and good app. There are so many glitches that it‚Äôs by FAR the worst fitness tracking app I‚Äôve used. Even when you complete a run in your workout plan, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mark itself as complete. There‚Äôs also no option to mark it complete manually. It‚Äôs not a smooth connection with Apple Watch‚Ä¶ which for a company who has collaboration with Apple is questionable. And indoor run tracks don‚Äôt work and don‚Äôt track miles even if you mark indoor run. Over all this literally deserved one star if that‚Ä¶I hate to give this app a poor review, because for the most part it is great.  But Nike‚Äôs decision not to allow me to start runs from my half marathon training plan from my watch, forcing me to carry my phone on all these runs for absolutely no reason, is so stunningly not in keeping with caring about the runner that I have no choice.

What are you thinking, Nike?  You already have a great watch app which allows syncing with the phone, starting runs from the watch, and tracking them without use of the phone.  For goodness sake, integrate the training plan runs into the watch app!!!!  Now!!!!!! Today!!!!!!!!!!!This app is great for tracking runs and running pace, but the glitches are beyond frustrating. I can count at least 5 times when the app randomly quits mid-run. For example, say I‚Äôm going on a 2 mile run. Occasionally, I‚Äôll look down at my phone to see how long I‚Äôve been running for. Words can‚Äôt describe how frustrating it is when you know you‚Äôve been running for over 10 minutes and look to see that the app has quit itself and has only recorded 3 minutes of your run. Nike should look into this as it is very frustrating when your progress is not being recorded!",0,"Buggy and unreliableNever update to latest app versionUsed to be betterNew watch metrics missing/Personal recordsDisappointed since updatesGreat concept, terrible implementationStopping during my races when using Apple Watch app and no phoneStill works well but dated.Slow and glitchyGave up on waiting for a working appGreat programs but glitchiest app everNot for the serious runner.:(Glitches, Crashes and Freezes!Apple Watch Stop Button Flaw!They fixed it until it was brokenDisappointmentWhy even use it anymore?Coach  Bennet is insufferablePhone and watch issuesDisappointed in the recent updates.Unreliable, especially with the watchCoaching plan runs not recording to planGood but really needs an easy fixPhone and watch don‚Äôt live Sync on treadmillGreat app when it worksStability is a problem. . .stillInconsistent/poor performanceNeeds improvementApple Watch Sync IssuesSeriously‚Ä¶.?!Almost so goodThe glitches are very frustrating.",PlnarayanRamblin_Wreck_RunnerJames 3476321DominusSephchloetykalAppReview85131820Asia_00Juniorrazshjl34dancolombia55tyler2793spdyGonzinterplanetairenoorefaragBelievenblueFeign AmnesiajszatalaBonibeetarantula87SillygrrrlRagsy1083lat3ralus65Prh1415Chi Town Chris 4TwooletA.HirzKelw1aponencblueeyes76sStickSandersEliboo918WEP99999ds1984r,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,3,0,1,3,4,33,0,2,1,5554,has_tracking,216

I‚Äôm disappointed because I like the guided runs and training plans the app offers but I can no longer overlook it‚Äôs other issues. I have an Apple Watch series 3 and it is nearly impossible to sync my runs between my watch and phone. Lately any run that I start from my watch is deleted which is especially annoying with speed runs in which it is much easier to start and stop intervals from my watch. I‚Äôve lost my running streaks because of this inability to sync and any adaptability in my training plans. When runs are started from my phone my watch fails to sync and provide useful stats throughout or after the run. As I said previously, I love that the app offers free training programs for various goals. I used one of these to train for my first half marathon. However, I do have a few gripes. I understand that incorporating Nike Training Club workouts into plans gives both apps use, but it is difficult when you already have a plan on the NTC app. It would be nice to have the option to exclude these workouts from training plans or link your current NTC workouts. It would also be super useful to allow for the training plans to be customizable. Plenty of other apps already offer this feature. Until Nike can properly track and record my runs, I‚Äôm done.I am very disappointed with my first experiences with Nike+. I just purchased an Apple Watch for the sole purpose of tracking my runs through the MapMyRun app training plans. The Apple Watch didn‚Äôt support using the training plans with the watch alone so I decided to give Nike+ a try assuming it would work seamlessly on the Apple Watch given that Nike is even part of the name of the Watch. I‚Äôve been very disappointed. First, moving from MapMyRun to Nike+ means loosing over 1300 miles of runs tracked on MapMyRun. This is super disappointing to have to start brand new with a new app and not be able to transfer past workouts over. Second, I love MapMyRun‚Äôs training plan but I was willing to give Nike+ My Coach a try. The feature seems great BUT I cannot use My Coach without bringing my big bulky phone along on runs with me. This is a huge development oversight on the part of Nike. The entire reason I forked out $477 for a Watch was to be able to leave my phone at home. If you are a serious runner you are using My Coach and running at speed a and distances that are not conducive to lugging around a bulky phone with you. For this reason alone I drop my rating of Nike+ from 5 to 3 stars. I‚Äôd love to love the app if you corrected these issues.I love Nike‚Äôs coaching program which helps me train for my half marathon. But there are two things I‚Äôm not happy about. One is a glitch and the other was a flaw in how they decided to count the interval sprints. First the glitch is that the runs don‚Äôt actually apply to the run on that day even though you hit start from the coach section on that day. Instead the next week when it asks you if you want to adapt your plan in accordance with your level, it asks you to apply the runs to a day but they don‚Äôt belong on that week, they belong on the week prior but you no longer have access to that week to properly do so. The design flaw: used to when you had HIIT days where you ran 7 200 meter sprints with 2:45 minute breaks (for example), you hit ‚Äúpause‚Äù after you completed the interval and it started counting your break time so you knew exactly when you needed to start again. It no longer does that. Instead you have to hit ‚Äúlap‚Äù to count the interval and stop the distance tracking for that one interval and then hit pause so it won‚Äôt start tracking the next interval. It doesn‚Äôt count during your break and the phones time doesn‚Äôt always show at the top so you can‚Äôt keep track of that very well. Very poorly thought out. Please go back!I have been using NRC off and on over the years to record my runs. I recently got back on it and have really been revving up my running discipline. I saw the ‚ÄúRun 7 times in a week‚Äù streak achievement and decided to give it a shot, running 2 miles a day from Sunday to Saturday. Well, I just finished my final 2 mile run for the week and it didn‚Äôt reward me the achievement. At least I know I did it but I‚Äôm quite disappointed the app doesn‚Äôt recognize my accomplishment. 

The app is lacking in several other useful features. For example, it would be nice if I could set it to stop recording the run at the completion of the distance I put in instead of me having to manually remove my phone and queue it up to manually stop it when I‚Äôm done running. It would also be nice to specify certain distances or times for a beep or recording to prompt me where I am within my run. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm ‚Äúhalfway there‚Äù sometimes‚Äîjust tell me when I have half or quarter of a mile left so I can gun it out. 

There are many more features that could make this app 5-stars in my opinion but without these, it‚Äôs just good to record your runs and get coaching, which I don‚Äôt really use all that much.I really want to like this app. I‚Äôve used Nike for tracking for over a decade. For the occasional runner it‚Äôs amazing. However, I‚Äôm now training for races and find it unreliable. I‚Äôve been using their ‚Äúcoach‚Äù plan to train for a marathon. Every time the plan wants me to use Nike‚Äôs training app as part of the plan it doesn‚Äôt sync and makes me update the NRC app. The app says it‚Äôs updated so I have to delete from my phone then reinstall. This has happened 4 times. This last time the update deleted my plan ENTIRELY. My run data is still there but the plan is gone and I can‚Äôt set up a new plan because my race is only 6 weeks away. I also find the Apple Watch app insufficient as I can‚Äôt begin a coach run from my plan in my watch. So if running intervals, I have to hold my phone in my hand and pause it manually when I see I‚Äôve hit the distance, (200 meters etc). It will not appear on my watch.  If I try to set a distance from the watch to match my plan and assign later, the plus and minus buttons move the distance at random distance and I can‚Äôt set it at exactly 10 miles for example. In summery the coach feature is awesome in theory and incredibly frustrating in practice. For everything else I find it to be a great tool.I really love the NRC app the guided run was great for keeping me motivated to get put there and run for the first time in almost 5 years. I

I have an Apple Watch series 2 and For about the last 4 weeks now the app on my iphone and on my apple watch have been out of sync. Before the 6.9.1 update it didn't matter if I started a run on my phone or my Apple Watch they would be tracking my run simultaneously and all data would show up in the app on my phone, then it would only track on one or the other and updates on the app after about a day (sometimes) it would be really annoying cause I'm would not really sure if my run was recorded properly until the next day or so. Now my watch is completely un-synced from my phone, I don‚Äôt trust the Watch app to start any runs because non of it appears to be sent back to the app on my phone, the only thing it captures is my heart rate and that‚Äôs it. What makes it really weird is that my watch is perfectly synced with the NTC app - no Apple Watch issues.

Really hope this bug gets fixed in the next update, I really like this app and would hate to have to find something else.I have been using NRC for four years, since Nike Plus days. I love the design, the feedback and achievements, the community features, integration with music. And unlike most other apps, it never bugs you about upgrading to premium version.
But after 500 runs, it reached a point of being unusable. The startup takes several minutes on an iPhone SE. Countdown to run stops at ‚Äú1‚Äù and stays there for up to a minute before tracking starts. Many updates bring bugs like music muting when the run starts, forcing restart of the Music app, etc. The web site version was always very slow, but now the community features like heat maps seem to be disappearing.
I have moved my runs to Strava (exporting runs from Nike is a challenge in itself!), which is extremely responsive in comparison. Going back through run history is a snap, and tracking starts instantly. Yes, the feedback is missing, unless you pay an annual fee. But at least I start each run in a better mood.I‚Äôve been using NRC to train for an upcoming marathon and have been incredibly impressed with the guided runs and the training plan in general. However, I am so frustrated by the indoor run tracking function. My distance is always off when I‚Äôm on the treadmill. If I run a 8.6 pace, say, it‚Äôll show up as a 11 minute pace or even slower. If I‚Äôm running an 11 minute pace, it‚Äôll say I ran a 7 minute mile. I have tried toggling off and then back on motion tracking, deleting the app, holding my phone different ways while I run, etc., and it‚Äôs almost always incorrect. Although I can track the distance of my run using the treadmill screen, it makes estimating my pace for the half marathon difficult. It‚Äôs also incredibly annoying to have to end a guided run when the app still thinks I have a mile left. I really hope they fix this issue.I love so many things about this app but there are a few very annoying things that prevent me from giving it a higher rating. For one, I use the guided runs A LOT and none of them sync to my history on the app when I run indoors or out and I have to go in and add them each time. If Nike could fix this so the guided runs would sync or count at all I would give it a better rating. Also, it has no way of tracking indoor runs even if you put that you used a treadmill or running indoors and that messes with my pace and averages and I have to use another means to record my pace and mileage. Finally as I‚Äôm using the app to record a run, sometimes it will sync to my watch and sometimes not. Or if I use my the app on my apple watch instead it won‚Äôt sync to the app on my phone. Some annoying bug fixes and it would be so much user friendly and helpful.I‚Äôve been using the app since about 2012. It‚Äôs okay for personal tracking, but when you start wanting to manage friends and run challenges the app is pretty limited in my opinion. It shouldn‚Äôt take me all day to figure out how to add my friends on the app. Furthermore, why can‚Äôt I see pending friend requests? I dont know... Also, it‚Äôs annoying during runs that the app will ‚Äúpause my workout‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt resume automatically. I‚Äôve lost a lot of my tracking during runs. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time baby sitting the app and having to reopen my lock screen and bring up the app just to restart the run a thousand times. It takes away from the run and slows me down being preoccupied with managing/ pushing buttons the whole time. I remember the app being better with this feature years ago.This is generally a good app and I use it for for my training programs but I wish it was more flexible. You can flex rest days/long runs/ etc within a week but can‚Äôt flex between weeks. Example: I did my long run Saturday. I couldn‚Äôt fit in a run Sunday. I want to do that run Monday and make Sunday a rest day but can‚Äôt unless I change the date/time settings on my phone. Basically Nike, just give me a few days buffer before you lock out a week. Or don‚Äôt lock out a week at all. Also half the time the runs don‚Äôt register as part of the program so I have to manually edit them which apparently screws up other tracking and is just annoying. I‚Äôll keep using the app because I like the training plans more than Runtastic but the Runtastic app is so much easier to use.Dear, Nike Run Club APP
I've been tracking my runs with this for ten years. I liked it when it was still Nike+ and just tracked you run without all the new added fluff/ fillers. Why oh why haven't you added some more interesting posters in all these years. I like sharing my runs and not only are the pictures the same old boring minimal selection but on top of that you've now REMOVED? several of the layouts that show your run. I don't understand how this was viewed as an improvement by anyone. Back to the posters though, I mean really... Add some cool posters, pictures, and bring back the few layouts you had. I don't care about ""running with *insert a rich athlete's name here*"" I just want to track my run and share it with an awesome background.I started using this app to make tracking my marathon easy and more interactive! My first run I tried it on was a circuit I‚Äôve done several times, and mapped using various methods. I was happy that the audio coach called out my splits mid-run, but I was surprised when those mile splits were at different locations than I anticipated. I figured it was just using the GPS either more/less accurately. I figured a .15 mile difference per 3 mile loop wasn‚Äôt too bad, but not optimal. However, when I completed my run, the run map didn‚Äôt match the audio, but instead matched what I expected my mile splits to be. Not a deal breaker, but now I don‚Äôt know how much to trust the app to accurately map my longer runs.I‚Äôve used Nike Run Club for a few years for tracking runs. It does an amazing job providing just what I need and want without trying to sell me something (which seems to be true of every other running app). Nike needs to work on this new update though. I‚Äôve lost 3 runs in the past 10 days because they log on my Apple Watch (series 7) but the app on my phone has logs me out of my account for some reason. And then when I try to sync from my watch, the most recent run is gone. Still have the data in Apple Fitness, so I can manually input, but that‚Äôs annoying after years of no issues. Please fix this Nike.I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and never had an issue. Then, in the past week, there have been two instances where, without any warning or notification, the app randomly just stopped tracking in the middle of my run. I only realized the app had stopped logging my miles when I finished my run and realized the app hadn‚Äôt been tracking since about midway through, or when I hit what I knew to be a mile mark and didn‚Äôt hear the app tracking tell me what mile I was on. The main reason I use the app is to track the length of my runs as I marathon train and if this issue is not addressed I will be transitioning to a different run tracking app.Similar to other critical reviews, my main issues with this app are syncing and consistency. It will work great for a couple of weeks and then suddenly on one run, my watch won‚Äôt sync so I can‚Äôt track heart rate or I revert to tracking the run just on my watch and it won‚Äôt sync the run to my phone afterwards, OR, the best one is when the run disappears entirely from the watch and the phone even though both were tracking the run while I was running. Sometimes the guided run will double back and replay the last couple of lines. Giving the three starts for the 65% of the times that it does work. I just downloaded strava to see if I can get more consistent results there.I use the Nike+ app every time I run but it seems a bit slow on tracking distance during my runs.  My watch is always 6-9 Kim‚Äôs ahead of my iPod app.  Also, I see people who post their photos in other arts of the world with features that I do not have even on my phone, is there something I am missing or is it I can go to the website and adjust my settings to have all the features?  I am just bored with the basic stickers and features that have not changed in 2 years.  I do enjoy the challenges and runs with the pros. Just want updated basic options and a solution to why the gps on my iPod app is slow.  Thank you #justdoit

Justin BurtykThis app got me to 1000 miles.  Wasn‚Äôt shooting for that, but when it came...hoorah!!  Awesome.  It was a pretty solid app, but then idk what happened.  The calibration dropped out and it hasn‚Äôt been nearly accurate distance wise.  I matched it up to a different app (pacer) and over a 3 mile run pacer was at 3 miles (accurate) nikes was at 3.45.  I really want this app to be on the correct again.  Simple.  Easy to use and didn‚Äôt crash out like pacer does.  Or didn‚Äôt for me.  But I‚Äôll take the occasional crash to pick up where I left off over inaccurate tracking.  Tracking is EVERYTHING to your boy these days. Let‚Äôs get it together so we can work it out Nike!!  Get after it!!  Thanks for the push, BI live in a very cold climate, so I don‚Äôt do much running outside. The indoor tracking on the treadmill or track is not very accurate (I‚Äôve compared it with my own calculations on the track and the time on the treadmill several times). For this reason I typically enter in my time and miles manually unless I‚Äôm running outside. But if I do this I can‚Äôt participate in any of the challenges. I wish there was a way to participate in challenges even if you enter your times manually, just for personal development. I don‚Äôt care about prizes or being the best, I just like to see a goal and work toward it with other people. Other than that, the app is pretty good.The Nike running all used to be my go-to for run tracking. Recently though, it‚Äôs been super glitchy with the training programs. In the middle of a benchmark training run today, it just started a whole new run without me pressing or touching anything. The other day after tracking a Speed run, which I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to actually time my recovery, my training program completely switched the scheduled run for that day from Speed to Easy Run making it impossible for me to even try and figure out what I did wrong. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with the app lately and will most likely be trying another app to train for my upcoming run.I have loved this app since I downloaded it years ago. Last year during COVID lockdown I used it more with my Nike Apple Watch. This year I‚Äôve been losing concentration while running because the app on my watch stops tracking my run and resets them, when it finally tracks me again it misses a mile that I‚Äôve run and shows that it takes 12 minutes for me to finish 0.3 miles which slows my time down drastically. I‚Äôve uninstalled and all that jazz but still no update or fixes to the glitches. I‚Äôve also lost runs completely. Please fix these glitchesHave been using for roughly 8 years. Nike has had some BRUTAL releases over the years, where the app seemingly goes backward in functionality. Nike has routinely dropped features from prior versions, and I‚Äôve given enough feedback over the years to determine Nike doesn‚Äôt really factor feedback (from all customers, not just me) into their product roadmap. Stopped using the Nike Apple Watch version simply because the GPS tracking was horrible, and syncing with Apple AirPods was glitchy. Didn‚Äôt mean for this to be so negative...... the current version app is decent and gets the job done. Despite release notes, cadence tracking not enabled.This is great for beginners because it is user friendly with fun coaching. However, know that the timing is not accurate all the time. It not until recently I‚Äôm finding out how off it really is‚Ä¶where I just ran a race and my timed race had me at 9:30 for 4 miles. Nike Run Club had me at 12:30 for those same 4 miles. That‚Äôs a big difference. Also knowing my body well enough because of my years running to know I was not running 12:30 miles. And yes, my phone and app has the most recent updates. Go with other tracking apps if you want accurate timings.I left the app open while doing a run, and when my phone received an Amber Alert the app stopped tracking my distance but kept the clock going. I randomly checked my phone several minutes later and saw that this happened, but otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have known. This has occurred 3 times in my past 200 runs, which statistically isn‚Äôt bad but as a distance runner who trains for races I care deeply about my stats and can‚Äôt rely on Nike because I‚Äôm checking my phone every few minutes to make sure it didn‚Äôt stop tracking.I‚Äôve been using this app since March and have logged over 100 miles with it. Until this week, it was tracking my average mile time from 11-12 minutes, typically near 11:30. My last two runs have averaged 13:30 minutes per mile and required further to run to achieve the mile distance on the same exact course I have been running since March. Some information has stated it has to do with service GPS. I find it hard to believe after all these months it decides to change. Can someone look into this, over 4 months it has been consistent until this week.I have used this app daily for the last 3 years on both my watch and phone. The app is in desperate need of an update to take advantage of all the new metrics that are available with the native apple running app (heart rate zones, rolling mile, etc). Also the ability to export data to other apps would be awesome. The shoe tracking is very helpful but the ‚Äúdefault shoe‚Äù feature has never worked and would be a great feature to add. Currently you have to manually add your shoe to each run afterwords. Please consider upgrading this app!I‚Äôve continually had problems with starting my run in the Coaching section only to complete it and find out it didn‚Äôt link to that day‚Äôs run. I then have to spend 5 mins Editing my run to associate it with the coaching plan. Like others, I‚Äôve also had problems with starting a run and finding out much later in the run that it simply stopped tracking it as a run as if I never hit start. 

I still like the app for recommended training schedules with the coaching section and the guided runs. Hopefully these bugs will be worked out soon.To be fair, I do like this app individually. It has great features and the run tracking is excellent. My biggest complaint is the fact that the training plans integrate the Apple watch and other apps, namely the Nike Training Center app. When I run with the watch only the run does not transfer to the NRC app. You cannot start a run on the app and transfer it to the phone or vice versa. And My Plan often requires NTC workouts that then do not transfer back to complete the My Plan requirement. It would be five star if it worked with my watch and the other associated applications.I have used this app for a couple of years and it worked great! I even use it ""over"" my 5K running app to track distance and play my workout playlist, since the 5k app's distance isn't as reliable or shuts off as soon as I reach the end of that session, even if I'm still out jogging. But recently it has stopped syncing with my Apple Watch and there appears to be a delay between my watch and the phone. And today it just stopped tracking halfway through my workout. Now I see all these other reviews of other people have similar issues. Not good!I have been using this app for some time with the My Coach feature. While for the most part it is great at creating a running plan, there are some simple things that this app is missing that prevents me from rating higher. The inability to assign runs in previous weeks of your plan if if you accidentally miss the window, the inability to manually enter workouts from the Nike Training Club, and the lack of automatic tracking during interval training are some examples of inconveniences. I may continue to use this app, but it won‚Äôt be without frustration.This is a good app for tracking walks and runs. I like that it tells you info over Bluetooth headphones every mile, and also gives you a halfway point prompt over headphones. The app does a pretty useful thing‚Äîlets you set which shows you‚Äôre using, so you can track mileage on your trainers. BUT! You can only choose certain Nikes. I have 2 pairs of Nike running shoes and neither of them are on the app. I can add the Adidas runners that I bought at Costco, but not the Nike runners that I bought specifically for running. It‚Äôs insane!",0,"Switching appsCan‚Äôt use My Coach on Apple Watch without lugging phone around on runsGreat but disappointingDisappointedGreat app when it worksI like it but the Apple Watch feature needs an updateGreat app for casual runs, problematic for long-time useIndoor Run IssueWish it would be consistentFair rating.

In some older versions, for the runs which were not just distance runs, e.g. runs where it's X distance to complete, there used to be guidance along with the run. If it was a benchmark run there would be a recorded trainer guiding through the runs different stages. However it seems that the feature for that was removed or it's not working on my phone without any indication.

It was one of the strongest features which I felt the app had and it seems without it there might be more value in another running app. I'd say for just tracking runs this does a really good job. Just don't expect it to wow with any other features and it seems the app doesn't get updated frequently either.The app is great in terms of measuring distance, GPS tracking, and elevation. I pair my Apple Watch as well with a Heart Rate Monitor and when i run outdoors it does a great job of tracking my Heart Rate throughout my course. The Apple Watch Nike interfaces are great and easy to use especially while you‚Äôre on a run. It is easy to switch between displays to see different measures. I love on the Apple Watch that I‚Äôm able to slide to the left to see my music and skip a song without having to backtrack out of Nike Running App. 
Where improvements can be made: Nike Running App is great for Running, however When i swim or go cycling, I use Strava as Nike does not have apps for those exercises. It would be GREAT if Nike could sync my runs over to Strava so I wouldn‚Äôt have to manually input anything. Second, for some reason when I run on a treadmill the app records my average Heart Rate but does not display the graph, for someone who runs intervals, it would be great to see how my Heart Rate fluctuates at different speeds.This app does a pretty good job of tracking runs.  I have seen improvements made over the past few months which is encouraging.  The treadmill run tracking used to be horribly off (miles), but it seems to have either gotten much more accurate or it learns as I adjust the miles manually... I‚Äôm not sure.  

Overall I‚Äôm pretty satisfied and it seems to be closer to par with some of the other major running apps.  

A few things I wish they would improve are:  (1) Watch interface:  I wish they would give more options on the layout of the watch interface.  The heart rate is too small for me to read while running.  (2) add heart rate to the voice prompts when running. (3) show weekly stats in the app.  I‚Äôd like to see total miles by week.  Monthly totals are fine, but weekly numbers are more actionable.  If I‚Äôm having a slow week, I don‚Äôt want to wait until the end of the month to notice.  A bar chart by week for total miles would be awesome.I have used Nike+ Run for many years now. I have found it to be the most accurate run tracking app out there. The quick run feature is top notch.

I love the idea of their training plan feature. I decided to try it out for a 15 mile trail race I am doing in May. (I wish there was an option for a 15 mile race, but I am training per the half marathon plan, doing the runs on trails instead of roads.) The issue is, I will do the prescribed workout, starting it from the start button on each workout on the training plan, and it only occasionally attributes what I have run to the workout I selected. The app logs my mileage just fine, but it drives me nuts to see that it doesn‚Äôt attribute what I have done to the plan that it has created for me. I don‚Äôt want to end the plan, but if it isn‚Äôt going to count my runs, what is the point of having it create a plan that ‚Äòchanges to my effort‚Äô? PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!Fist and foremost, let me say that this is an excellent app for novice and advanced runners alike. It is a great tool for tracking progress. That being said, there are some annoying problem that occur. Not infrequently, I start my run and to then open the app at the end of it only to find it glitched out was not tracking my milage and split times. Additionally, the leaderboards are completely plagued by hackers (people running 4,000 miles a month, which could only be possible if they ran 7 marathons a day at near world records speed) which ruins what could be a super fun thing! I am by no means a competitive runner but I would love to be able to push myself and compete with people on the leaderboards without people artificially inflating their numbers. Hope they fix those issues! Still a great app!This app is great for tracking runs and providing motivation. The coaching feature works well for multiple different race types. 

Minor fixes could make NRC the best app around. There is a delay in the start/pause/stop buttons and get isn‚Äôt a huge problem..... until you accidentally stop a run mid-workout. There is no way to continue a paused run nor can you merge two runs. Once you are complete with your workout if you choose to edit your run you lose all credit for your miles in your challenges. This really takes away from the motivation factor this app is trying to accomplish. 

The minor fix to allow merging two runs would make this a ten-star app.Does a great job of tracking runs and provides data such as pace, heart rate, elevation, and air temp. On my apple watch, the elapsed time is hard to read while running and without glasses. I would like to see distance and time in the same large text - one on top of the other. 

The coach feature can build a great plan to prepare for your next race. I really like that. It would be nice if you can alter your plan across weeks and remove some items or manually mark them as complete if needed. I would also like to combine runs if I accidentally stop the watch and need to restart - that‚Äôs easy to do when running intervals.Good app to keep you motivated with your daily routine. The score boards keep you going if you willing to keep competition with your fellow runners worldwide. All in all they need to work on the movement reading of the individual as at his workout. I run quite a bit but the app does not read the actual distance which then demotivates me to continue. I feel im not running much where as my other device shows me the distance covered to the exact measurements. I would not rely on the app to calculate my workout distance. If this is fixed its a five star app all in all.",0,Good run tracker but nothing elseGood..but could be betterNot bad... does the essentialsTraining plan is buggy...Good but flawedCould be so much betterWorks great and could be betterOverall fine.,asjan91NicoCastilloeweaverjs23RunnerMomx3RidingledangleKirbyW1aforbiMagic'omega,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,1,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,1236,has_tracking,216

Still a good app but I the distance calculations has been off quite a bit. I haven‚Äôt been shorted a mile on multiple runs. The app is tracking the distance but not calculating correctly, shorting me on my goals through the app.  Please fix. 
I have completed a 10K run thanks to this app and would and do recommend it to people. 

Updated 2/1 I‚Äôve began to follow a running plan.   Having an actual plan/coach on this app would be great vs. having to follow a PDF then find the correlating run. Also, the app has continuously crashed on me during my indoor runs. It‚Äôs not logging any of my runs when done inside. This is becoming very frustrating. I've enjoyed this app thoroughly. Ive recently started running again after multiple years of surgeries and injuries. have passed milestones for myself with this app! I've even considered trying a 10k. So thank you. Unfortunately there have been a few occasions when I've been running on the treadmill that the app crahses and doesn't log my run, which is really frustrating and unmotivating. Minus that the coaches are great and I like the different options to mix things up. If the glitches and not logging could be fixed this would be perfect.The map that shows you pacing is exactally what I needed and it does it‚Äôs job on a phone perfectly. I recently got an Apple Watch series 5 and I was excited to hear Nike Run club was integrated with it, but in reality it wasn‚Äôt. The only integration was an easier pathway to start a run. When on a run your time fades away to the watch face and real time, making it unnecessarily difficult to check your pacing, distance, and time of run. Also, it is impossible to hit a lap button to distinguish for your self the times and paces for workouts that you take rests on. Track workouts become a pain and you can‚Äôt stop the tracking of the watch and still see the time going if you want to be able to check your pace during the workout. If you have a series 5, the default Apple workout app is much better. While it does not have a lap function, it does keep the important running information available at all times. In the end, if you don‚Äôt have a series 5 Apple Watch, this is the App for you. If you do have the series 5, there is almost no use in downloading this app.Overall, this is a solid all around app. I have used it for about 5 years now. I really like it, however, it has a few issues that are frustrating.
Treadmill use: It doesn‚Äôt track your distance so well. I think it assumes your average rate, and then plugs it in what it thinks you have done. The bad side of that is if you try to fix the distance by matching it up to the treadmill in the end, it won‚Äôt count your mileage for any of your challenges. Kind of a waste.
Running outside: Occasional glitching. Most common is the tracking of a distance. I run a specific trail regularly. Approximately 100 times. It usually measures out at 3.24 to 3.25 miles. Other times it‚Äôs 3.19. Not that big of a deal, but if you edit the run to account for the missing distance at all, it will erase the entire run. A bit irritating. 
Then sometimes it glitches and delete runs at the completion.I was using a different, older running app for so long because I didn‚Äôt want to leave my stats and records. But after a break from serious running, I decided to switch to Nike Run Club! I love the way the app visualizes the results of an individual run and as whole the app is much more than just a run tracking app. 

One thing I‚Äôm really missing though is a way to track weekly and monthly mileage. Weekly mileage is so important for measuring progress and preventing injury when training for a race. I found a way to see my weekly mileage on the leaderboard, but it only tracks back 1 week, doesn‚Äôt tell me everything I want to know, and isn‚Äôt a good experience to quickly compare weeks or months. 

So if there‚Äôs any product people reading this, please build out the run history section to track mileage/stats over time!Great app, I use it whenever I‚Äôve run, and I‚Äôve used it for almost a year now‚Äîso I really like it and i think it does a fantastic job, especially considering all the great features (shoe tracking, achievements, challenges, autopause, audio feedback, and more), but it has some serious problems.

Problems: General sluggishness. It often takes a bit to start up the run and will occasionally randomly pause and not start up until you do it manually. The big one is it glitches out and DOES NOT TRACK your whole run. I run the same route through Central Park everyday so I know about how far I‚Äôm running and it‚Äôs very frustrating when it only tracks 2 miles for the 7 miles I ran. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to hit goals and get accurate readings.

Some improvements: An option so whenever I auto pause I can hear the audio feedback about distance. The ability to have audio feedback tell me the time of day as well as the rest. Update the weird share feature to something more useful. I don‚Äôt know maybe modest Nike discounts for hitting certain milestones.

I never write reviews but I‚Äôm writing this one because I love this app, use it everyday, and want it to get better! Thanks Nike! :) #checksoverstripesStarted using this app in May as I started running with some friends who issued a challenge. Love the app but have had a couple issues with connecting with my Apple Watch and with GPS tracking. Only on a few occasions, I‚Äôve finished a run with my watch and watched the splits and breakdown and then pushed ‚Äúdone‚Äù only to not have it show up in my completed runs. This forced me to enter manually on my iPhone but since I have to enter manually it doesn‚Äôt count towards challenges. Also on a couple occasions the GPS didn‚Äôt track part of my run and the map showed me running through houses and backyards on a false line that cost me roughly a quarter mile. Honestly love the app just had a few issues and Nike‚Äôs support line has a 45+ minute wait time on their phone #.I have been using the NRC app for years and it works great for tracking you runs and history. However there haven‚Äôt been many updates to some of the features in a while. For example, when sharing your runs the ‚Äústickers‚Äù are the same old one. You can only use the same ‚Äúpre lives‚Äù ‚Äúwe running today‚Äù or little fluffy cloud person stretching so many times. Add a new sticker pack. Also it would be nice to see more info about your friends runs. Right now all you can see is their mileage on the leaderboard. It would be nice to see more stats like pace, average run distance and what not. Freshen up. Nice guided runs being added but that‚Äôs not enough for a five star rating.I‚Äôve been using Nike Run Club for 3-4 years, tracking all of my runs on it and no other tracker. Recently, the app logged me out of my account and all of my running data and progress is gone. I‚Äôve been trying to log back into my account, but it always says ‚Äòerror‚Äô and it won‚Äôt process. I had hundreds of miles and runs on there, and it‚Äôs really upsetting and discouraging to have all of it gone. I‚Äôm going to try to log in a few more times and hope for the best, otherwise I think I may start using another app or something. Besides that, the app is efficient and easy to use. I like the guided runs and how the run stats are shown. It‚Äôs a good appüëçüëçüëçThe Nike+ Run app is an app that could use some self awareness within its development to cater to the user a bit more. The guided runs are great for initially starting any distance training, but the guided runs provide distance increment updates that cannot be found outside of the coach repeating the same story, that becomes tired. This alone makes me not want to use the app because these repeated stories become distractions, especially when I only want to hear the distance increment(I.e. quarter mile updates within any times run). Lastly, the distance tracking varies greatly and makes tracking progress very difficult if on different days, the same starting line ends with a wide array of finish lines.I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but sometimes when I press START so that I can start running, and then I turn it off when I begin to run. I run an average of 4.5-5 miles a day (with rest days of course) and I set it to tell me feedback every mile split. Anyways, when I turn it off, after a while I don‚Äôt get any feedback so I turn on my phone and see what the holdup is, I then see that the app has crashed in the middle of my run. I go back into the app hoping to see that it‚Äôs still timing and tracking the distance I‚Äôve ran. Only to see that it hasn‚Äôt tracked a single thing, but then it starts up again as soon as I go into the app but it says that it‚Äôs just starting to time me. PLZ FIXED THIS STUPID GLITCH ASAP. THIS APP IS GREAT OTHER THAN THAT ONE STUPID STUPID GLITCH!!I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now and have tried out a few of the training programs. I really like the features and the ease of use. The training programs are great for beginners/ if you‚Äôre training for a specific distance or race like a 5k. My only issue with the app is that occasionally when I start my run through my Apple Watch instead of my phone (which is much easier to do because I keep my phone in an armband), the program will cancel out and stop tracking my run. I‚Äôll get to the end of my run with no data saved. However, I haven‚Äôt experienced this issue when starting the run from my phone.This app convinced me I could run and made me feel that it was okay to start wherever I was at. I‚Äôm super grateful for the motivation and the tracking and everything. Training for a 5k right now and made a plan on NRC, and my only gripe is that sometimes you can‚Äôt edit run data and include it in your plan log or whatever you want to call it. So there are some weeks that I know I did the runs in my plan but they didn‚Äôt show up in the my coach history. The other thing is that the plan incorporates workouts from Nike training club, but when I do those it doesn‚Äôt sync into my plan. For people who like to keep their data it kinda stinks but at least I actually did the real work!Great basic run tracking app. Mileage seems pretty accurate (I live in the city, not sure how it would do with spotty service). 
The biggest reason I downloaded was to use MyCoach to set and track my marathon training schedule. The workouts themselves seem reasonable. I‚Äôll increase my long run distances a bit as it maxes out at 18.5 and I‚Äôd like to get a 23 in before the race. 
Biggest complaint is a minor one...I‚Äôll complete workouts in MyCoach, rate them for difficulty, but the workout never gets counted in that section of the app. Not a huge deal since I know I ran it but the app supposedly adjusts your plan based on how the workouts go and idk how it can do that if it thinks I skipped my workout?Would have given 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it automatically stops location tracking if you switch connectors. I started running with my home WiFi (from my house) I ran 30 minutes then when I checked my phone it only said I ran 0,06 miles! The distance my WiFi stops and my celluar starts. Might be a coincidence, but I‚Äôm quite annoyed. All my work with nothing to track it (as a little achieve the indicator I guess). Hope you fix this problem and I‚Äôll change it to 5 stars. 

Edit: unless it‚Äôs not WiFi/celluar based in which then you really have to fix your location distance trackers. For all your users.I love this app and use it all the time. I use it for all of my distance tracking, BUT there are a few things I would like. 

Include miles and KM together so it can be viewed at a glance at any time so I don‚Äôt have to dig into settings and change it for certain workouts. This should not be complicated. 

Do better at weeding out the cheaters on the weekly and monthly challenges. No one runs 1,000 miles in four days üôÑ

I forgot to start a run today but remembered my route. It would be really nice to be able to draw the route on a map to get an accurate distance count. I had to go on google maps instead and add a million pins instead. 

It would be very very nice to be able to have at least 2 categories..walking and running. Like I said I use this app to track all my distances, including walking my dog. I don‚Äôt want to use multiple apps for this. I want to use this one. But my average pace gets all messed up in my metrics because there are walks and runs mixed in. Over the 4,500 miles I‚Äôve accrued so far these are my biggest disappointments.The app and Apple Watch interface are great and covers all the basics with pace, time, elevation, distance etc. However, the two basic faces for the Apple Watch may not be what each runner would want to see. Having the ability to change and move/scale fields would be awesome. Also, one draw back is that the indoor tracking of my runs is at least 4/10ths of a mile off for every 4 miles on the treadmill. It would help if there were a way to calibrate the app for stride length etc. Finally, the training that is built in is interesting. I haven‚Äôt used it much yet and still trying to find ones that might fit into my routine.I really do like Nike run club and I think it‚Äôs a fantastic app, it has encourage to run more everyday 
BUT 
There is a serious issue where I‚Äôm at 80% and then my phone shows me 3% and then the phones dies which leads to the app not tracking my miles and more frustrating is that after I plug my phone into the wall for a second the phone is now 60%. The issue of Nike run club shutting down has made me lose a lot of miles and nothing is more infuriating than you running that 10k but the app shuts down and says you ran 5k instead especially when it‚Äôs your fastest 10k.
Anyway the app is great but issues such as these are annoyingThe running plans are great. I am able to run consistently without getting injured. This is amazing. But:
- it's never clear whether I should start the run on my watch or phone. 
- while I'm doing a run it's not possible to see the type of run I started (speed, tempo, distance) and how long it is or how many intervals
- it's not clear how I should deal with intervals. Just wait my 45 seconds and start again? Lap? Shouldn't the app suggest a way?
- my NRC splits don't end up in the activity app
- the map of my run sometimes gets to activity, sometimes not 
- the heart rate sometimes gets to activity, sometimes not
- sometimes nrc has me categorize a run, sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes I have to categorize it several times because NRC doesn't remember. This was the most confusing thing when I started using it. 

Overall I think the workout app is better for tracking my runs but NRC is great for setting up a plan. I wish they worked better togetherThe layout of this app is nice. It‚Äôs easy to navigate, pleasant to look at, and has fun and useful features. My favourite feature is the free training plans! Incredibly helpful. However, I have lost multiple long runs using this app on my Apple Watch series 3! Not just unsynced, but actually gone. I switched to Strava because I was so frustrated. 

For some reason, I decided to try it for my (NRC) scheduled long run today, of 7.5 miles. I finished, went to look at my stats, and nothing! So frustrating! I will continue to use Strava as my tracking app, but will use the plans from NRC.I‚Äôm a recreational runner and this app has been very serviceable over the 6 years I‚Äôve used it. The social function and the shoe tagging feature are all great, and I love the badges and milestone tracking. Just two complaints- I don‚Äôt like feeling advertised to when it‚Äôs time to run, and updates over the last few years have made this app feel more like a magazine. Second is that when I add a new shoe that isn‚Äôt Nike brand and doesn‚Äôt have an assigned picture, I can‚Äôt add a picture myself. Not a big deal for everyone, but I don‚Äôt like it.I have used some version of the NRC app since it was a gizmo I had to wear in my shoe (old school Nike+). I wasn‚Äôt always happy with the changes, but it was never enough to chase me away. I have only ever requested one thing. PROGRAMMABLE INTERVALS. If lesser apps can have them for free, surely the great and powerful Nike can figure out a way. I would love to stop running two apps when I want to do intervals ‚Äî and I am not the only one. Please, please, please. It would make your app a monster in training and tracking!Starting this cross country season, I have really started tracking my runs, mainly to see how many miles I have put on my shoes. I have loved the Nike experience while using it, but there are a few weak points and bugs. The biggest of which being competitions that your friends have made. I found that my miles don‚Äôt always count towards it and it doesn‚Äôt always give you the victory even if you‚Äôve had more miles ran.I love the app. It works really well for mapping my runs and tracking my history. The extra features also look cool and plan on using them.

However, at the end of each run, you get some athlete that says something along the line of  ‚Äúgreat job!‚Äù That‚Äôs all fine... except when it‚Äôs Kevin Hart saying it to you. The last thing I want to hear after running is Kevin Hart screaming at me in his doofy annoying voice like it‚Äôs one of his stand up routines. It‚Äôs enough to cost this app review to lose a star.",0,"Good app.. few glitches.It pains me to write thisGreat... mostly.Almost PerfectGreat, but not perfectFantastic with a couple bugs...Functional good, but kind of staleGreat app, but my running progress and account is missing??A decent app with room to growGreat but one major issueGreat app from the phone, can be glitchy when starting runs through Apple WatchLove it with one caveatGreat, but MyCoach needs workLocation map tracker doesn‚Äôt alway workSo closeOverall it covers the basics and somePretty good BUT need to fix an issueThis app really helps me run, but it needs improvementOverall, great, but does have issuesGood app, but I liked the simpler versionalmost perfectAmazing App For Workout TrackingEverything is great except for Kevin Hart",TH1sSucksüòÉüòÖüòïüòñü§≠ü§¢ü§ÆTitsmagee84anitakyoskoehlBeaverLosJottisWillow BranchflowerJ.

I love using this app so much! It makes tracking my runs so much easier, and is super convenient to use. However, there are some things I think could make the app even better. One of them is the tracking. I love that when I‚Äôm looking back on my past runs I can see where I‚Äôve run before, but I think it would also be helpful to be able to plan routes as well. Since it already has the gps, you could just draw out a route following the streets, or you could type in however many miles you want to run, and it could find possible routes or trails near you to try. I personally think that this could make this app even better and more convenient than it already is. I also think it would be fun to ‚Äúremix a run,‚Äù if you were to redo a run you‚Äôve already done, and it could guide you to take the same route, and then you could try to beat your past time or something like that. It would also be nice to have almost a shopping tab where it would be personalized to your runs and the activity you‚Äôve done, and it could have recommendations for different shoes or Nike clothes that would be best for you depending on where, and how much effort you do when you run. None of these are fixes to problems or anything, but rather just things that would make your app even better. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a nice day!!!

-MiaI‚Äôm really impressed with the coaching available as part of the app. I picked up running recently and had started tracking runs in Strava. I decided to check out NRC because a friend of mine is using it and referenced it. I‚Äôm sure glad that I did! Previously I would just go out and run hard. But it‚Äôs hard to motivate for that kind of pain. I decided to try NRC‚Äôs 10k program to give me something to work toward. It has me doing speed runs, recovery runs, longer distances, etc. As a new runner, it has made running accessible and even kinda fun.
My problem is with the app itself. My 10k program from Nike is a PDF and it says which ‚ÄúGuided Run‚Äù I should do in the app. It begs the question why isn‚Äôt the program itself in the app? Failing that I should at least be able to search the guided runs for the name provided. But, no. So that‚Äôs why 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è.
It seems like they could do so much more with this app too. The coach doesn‚Äôt know my pace so can only say the level of effort I should put in. But the app does! It doesn‚Äôt seem like it would have to be very sophisticated AI to customize the training plan to me. Age should be considered too. As a 50-something I‚Äôm just not going to build strength and stamina at the same rate as a younger runner. 
In short, I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm using the app. You should definitely download it and give it a try. AND there is still a lot of opportunity for it to grow and improve.Absolutely love using the watch app to record my runs. The app has a ton of guided runs that can be downloaded on the Watch.  It was perfect for casual runs, but once I started training it got a bit annoying to use.  For instance there's a coach section that gives you workouts including speed runs tailored to your performance. Only problem is that you can't download those runs into the watch or record specific splits.  You have to run with your phone and even then you can't time recovery between splits.  Hoping they can add a feature like the Training app that does time recovery when using your phone.  If everything can be done on the Watch even better! 

Overall it's a great app for casual running and even some speed training if you want to use the guided runs. But for more intense tracking there's other options in running watches and apps.Nike Run Club is an app I‚Äôve used for awhile now to track my daily runs. I‚Äôve absolutely loved this experience and there‚Äôs many options to help you become a better runner. I am particularly fond of the guided runs and the training plans that NRC offers. The only thing that prevents me from giving this app 5/5 stars is the lack of variety in terms of the exercises. Adidas Running, Apple Fitness, and Strava all have various exercises such as biking and swimming that you are also able to track. Me being an avid Nike user and bike rider, I would love to be able track my daily bike rides with a Nike app! Most fitness apps have this capability and I‚Äôm kind of surprised that Nike hasn‚Äôt integrated this. I am hoping that cycling and other exercises will be implemented for recording distances and tracking soon! I love the apps!I love this app. I think it‚Äôs great to track everything I want for my fitness. Shoes, workouts, everything is great! The accuracy is spot on to every other app or brand of watch I‚Äôve used before. The only problem I have with the phone app is the character limit in the notes section. I used to use a website for tracking my runs and I would write a book when I needed to. I was in the middle of tracking my run and it cut me off in the middle of my thought. 

The problem I‚Äôm having with the app for the watch is that I don‚Äôt know how to create splits manually. The watch is great for giving me mile splits during my run, I love it. But when I do a workout of various distances (400, 800, 1000, etc.), I can‚Äôt figure out how to create a split to track what my times were.Absolutely love this app and all of the features like the guided runs. I never go on a run without it. That being said, the tracking is not always accurate. At first I thought it was just me because I had previously used other apps that tracked my normal run and knew it was approximately 3 miles, but on the bike app it said it was only a measly 1.72 miles. I accepted this at first but then decided to test my theory. I turned on all my running apps including this one and the other two apps said that I had in fact ran over 3 miles but the Nike app still said 1.8. I realized that the Nike app only tracks my distance if it is not in locked mode or if my phone itself is not locked. Regardless still love this app and the training app as wellI like the app. The coaching option is good for some people (I prefer a more motivating experience vs constantly talking throughout the run). The distance tracking is good but slightly off at times (could be my Apple Watch). I like the ability to control my playlist and the Apple Watch interface is nice and easy to use. 

Improvements: I‚Äôd like to see some tracking of weather besides temperature. I run/walk outdoors in Texas and it is humid and often windy here. I‚Äôd like the app to account for wind resistance when calculating the run difficulty and adjust the overall time to account for said resistance. 

I‚Äôd also like to see a better auto pause feature. Often times in the middle of a run/walk it will pause then seconds later start up again. If this happens several times during a run it will effect your overall time. 

I‚Äôd also like to see the ability to create custom run routes similar to other apps. 

The Nike Run App is very good and has improved since I started using it back in 2012. I definitely recommend it and hope they‚Äôll continue to make improvements.I started using this app when I began training for a half-marathon. I like its training plan features: the way it sets a schedule, monitors progress, and adjusts based on performance. I appreciate being able to see a detailed record of my pace on runs. I even like the cheesy motivational voice-overs during tough runs. I think this app has helped me stay accountable to my plan. My only complaints about it are that I can‚Äôt edit my schedule for future weeks and that the app is terribly inaccurate at tracking distance on the indoor setting (off by almost a mile at times), forcing me to edit those runs when I‚Äôm finished. Those are the only major areas for improvement, though. Overall, I‚Äôm satisfied.Let me start by saying I truly love this app. I‚Äôm a new runner and NRC has helped keep me engaged and motivated through my first few months of running. I love the mileage tracking (both miles run and miles on your shoes). I love the coaching on guided runs. Coach Bennett has become a calming and comforting voice in my ear as I tick off the miles. The achievements, challenges, and badges earned have become great sources of pride and accomplishment for me. I‚Äôve only recently started reading the articles in the app but so far every one has been informative and helpful. 

With all that good there‚Äôs got to be some bad tho‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve had multiple runs (all indoor treadmill) not record even tho I listened to the entire guided run. And the app crashes or gets out of sync between watch and phone a lot. The Apple Watch app can be clunky at times. And the member link to the Nike store has never once worked for me. 

Suggestions‚Ä¶

Maybe award points per mile that can be exchanged for gear or discounts in the Nike store?Accuracy and ease of use has certainly improved over the last few years, and maybe I‚Äôm just whining, but I‚Äôd still like to be able to download my run history to manipulate it in Excel. My wife and I run separately, but walk together, and we track all that mileage.  What i can‚Äôt do is filter out walks to see just my run data and averages. So, a few months ago, i started tracking walks with the Underarmor app instead, and I deleted the walks during that timeframe. Now i only use Nike for runs. If I were a more disciplined runner, this may not be an issue, but I actually use my running history (or lack thereof) to motivate myself to run more often, and harder.This running app is pretty good. Not fantastic, but pretty good. Good at tracking time, miles, gear, notes, and a few other stats which I like. It‚Äôs very easy to use as in it doesn‚Äôt take very long to start running of figure out other features. I think if they could incorporate a few more features, it‚Äôd be really great though. I think I remember there used to be a feature where you could challenge friends through the app and I‚Äôd love to see that back. That made it a little more interactive. Also, there‚Äôs not a way I‚Äôve found to keep up with other people‚Äôs running progress which would be cool. Other than that great.I absolutely love this app. I am a self described terrible runner, but this app makes me do it anyway. I love that it has different awards to keep you motivated! I just wish there was a better way of tracking indoor runs like ones on ellipticals. I live in the Midwest where the weather is well... moody and I can‚Äôt always get outside. It would be nice if I could keep track of my splits and all that for indoor stuff too. Also, I tend to run same route each day but the distance on the app fluctuates so it isn‚Äôt the most accurate with distances. Overall though I love the app and will definitely keep using it!I love pretty much everything about what this app does for my running. It‚Äôs by far the best app I‚Äôve used for run tracking. I do wish the duration picker on the watchOS app was a roller instead of just +/-5. That seems strange to me. I also wish that the run plans would offer some more analysis of your improvement instead of anonymously making things harder or easier. It‚Äôd be nice to know why it‚Äôs upping/lowering mileage. It would also be nice if there was a summary at the end of a plan that documented your progress instead of just a ‚ÄúGood job‚Äù screen. Those are just ‚Äúnice to haves‚Äù, however, and I still believe this is the best free run tracking app.I really dig the guided runs n collecting achievements. I‚Äôm not much of a runner so has really helped me be consistent n get better 

I wish there was a search feature for finding runs rather than endless scrolling for the right one 

I also would like a Stopwatch feature or something of the sort where you can select a specific distance like 1 mile and run it your best to start tracking in your achievements n the app will tell you when you complete the specified distance. I want to push my fastest mile n have it tracked seamlesslyThis is a good app for every run and had some nice features. It does a great job of keeping track of the miles on your shoes and multiple pairs if needed. I have two pairs: one for dry days and the shield for cold and wet days so tracking mileage is a plus.

I‚Äôve also enjoyed the motivational comments after runs from coaches and Kevin Heart. They are always fun to listen to. 

I‚Äôm a little disappointed that it does not work with fit bit for heart rate. Hopefully Nike, Apple, Fitbit can work something out, but it‚Äôs definitely not a dealbreaker. 

Last, it‚Äôs nice to view total miles, but would be even better if there was a tree structure that would break it down by the year. I added up last few years miles and subtracted from total to get this year‚Äôs miles.  It would be better to view total miles by the year and have option to see all-time miles. 

Overall a useful app and even better that it‚Äôs free. Thanks.The Nike app does a good job of tracking run information like distance, speed, and elevation. It is nice to have it sync with the Apple Watch as well. I would like it if the mileage feedback was a more dynamic. For instance on my first mile it could give me audio details at quarter mile increments so I knew if I was on track for my personal best. Quarter mile feedback would be great on the last mile as well. The last quarter mile would be nice to hear tenth mile feedback. If there were more feedback options in the menu like this that would be better.I have used this AP for years and love it. It helps me with tracking runs, getting motivated, and getting back in shape when I‚Äôve been slacking. The only thing I wish I could change is the inability to sort the guided runs. They are all listed alphabetically, and there‚Äôs no way to sort by run type, coach, duration, when it was added, etc. It‚Äôs not a major issue, but it drives me crazy when I‚Äôm short on time and want to quickly find the right guided run ASAP. But otherwise I am a die hard NRC AP user. Highly recommend!I am a long time user of this app (6+yrs) It took a little time to get use to the changes, but so far so good..... I do wish you can add back up the ""shoe mileage tracking"" the old app would send me a reminder when I was getting closer to retired my shoes & I just notice I am over the 400 miles on my current Nike Free, I know I need to start breaking in my new ones for my next race, is it possible to add that to the app? It would be awesome if you do!!

Tracking my progress and stats motivated me to keep going, and the variety of guided runs are wonderfully helpful when starting out or to get out of a slump. Minus a star because I‚Äôd like more explanation on how to find my 5k pace, 10kpace, etc.; and because I think the interval runs could be improved. I need more explanation about how to count the intervals and keep tracking my progress on the app, and also on what recovery is supposed to be (walking? Jogging?). Overall really great.I love tracking all my miles in this app and seeing my progress over time. I‚Äôve done several training plans and there are a few simple improvements that are desperately needed or the training plans: 
(1) flexibility to exclude NTC workouts 
(2) link the scheduled runs to a relevant guided run, or just make the language match in the descriptions so I can tell what speed run will work for my training plan (plan says distance and number of reps, guided speed runs are all in time not distance)",0,"Great, could be awesomeFantastic CoachingIncredible with potentialPerfect‚Ä¶.almost.Love it but I have two problems.Love this app but minor problemsGood running/walking app just needs some tweaksExcellent except for...Bugs and glitches aside‚Ä¶this app is awesomeCould be better9/10Great but could use a few improvementsGreatKeeps me motivatedNice App, Needs a Couple Small ImprovementsDoes a good job of tracking runsI love everything except..Needs 1 updateMotivating tool!Best Running App‚Äî still needs a few tweaks","ü•∂ü•µü•≥Morp/-/euskcruz4Batboi19sarahf27SoccerPrincess90210gfrench3AdamabrownMtgwesternmaMS-DallasPhil Tuesdayjessi107FinleyHamishShelbyTheREIdynateejXO Man of WarAimstelReggie ""RoadRunner""Foodiesnob2014Asana app",0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,1,1,1,1,0,20,0,1,0,2952,has_tracking,216

Now that I‚Äôm back it‚Äôs only my third run and it‚Äôs not keeping up or even counting any of my runs for the challenges nor are any of my stats consistent. For instance I ran for 45 minutes today and I did 2 miles. My splits reported back that my first mile was one minute and fifteen seconds while my second mile was over fourth five minutes long! Since the app produced such inaccurate results it doesn‚Äôt count toward any of my goals or competitions. I‚Äôm so over this.I started using this app three or four years ago. I found it useful for tracking pace and miles run. The achievements were cool. But it lacked a real human touch. Given the visceral and emotional aspects of running this, in hindsight, was a major gap. I stopped using the app a year or so ago. My runs were actually slipping away and I was down to once a week. I had a different app I was using for life improvement that involved exercise. I started to get my runs back and turned back to the Nike app. I was very happy to discover a whole range of guided runs that were driven by a range of a smart kind and amazing athletes and coaches. I have tried various of the runs and have felt inspired to be positive toward my workouts. I especially like Coach Bennett‚Äôs runs. He is a solid coach and a solid dude. Thank you Nike.Ever since the last update, I thought I was the only one who had a crappy watch. Like most on here, I‚Äôve been experiencing major lag time, lost mileage and major headaches. At first, I thought that the issues would pass, but I quickly found out that wasn‚Äôt the case. What‚Äôs even worse is that whenever I charge my watch, the app somehow rests and I have to re-enter all my information before I can go for a run. I‚Äôll be selling my watch and going back to Fitbit! At least they get it right in the fitness tracking department. Apple watches are garbage and useless.No joke. This app changed my life. I started running for physical and mental health reasons. The tracking functions. The watch companion app. The social functioncs. The challenges and awards system. I got hooked on running but also getting achievements on the app. Became obssesed with the achievements system. Its like a video game! 2 years of use my life is totally different. I dont think I would have stuck with running if it wasnt for this app and running has saved my life and gave me a second chance and a new start. Thank you Nike!I used to run when I was living in Chicago because  Lake Shore Drive was the easiest trail to track but once I moved I was having trouble tracking my runs. Even having trouble getting outside to exercise. Once I downloaded this Nike app I haven‚Äôt been able to stay inside. Not only does the app remind you to exercise, they also encourage you after accomplishing a run, and they‚Äôre compatible with your music. This Nike Run Club app is the best, and easiest, running partner I could ask for.I love the stats the app keeps, and use it to track progress. I‚Äôve been using it for 5 years. I wish there was more consistency between the app and the web site. I have had multiple issues getting runs synced or logged on either phone/app or both. Plus the tracking seems to be off as I get congratulated on running 3 days in a row quite often, but not  when I run multiple times in a day. Overall it‚Äôs a good app, getting better each version.I need to know the exact time of day each run has been ran. 
Need fix gps. Will not find location until I've already started running by then it's too late and it won't go back until about a mile into my run.  If I start the app and put it on pause for about 10 seconds it'll finally find the GPS tracking but then It messes up my timing. 
This was the only app I used. 
I used this app to keep a log of all my runs (shoe mileage, notations, photos, etc.). All of which have disappeared. 
The new update will take some getting used to, which is expected, but do not remove the history from the previous versions. 
Please tell me there is some way to retrieve this information.
At least my shoe mileage is back with the new updated. Now, add all my log memos back and I'll be happy.This app has been my favorite running app for years. It‚Äôs always been pretty accurate with mileage, I love the extra features I can use as far as coaching, and it‚Äôs been tracking my total mileage for years! However, it stopped tracking my mileage accurately. The map is showing the proper path I took, but instead of showing 2 miles for example, it‚Äôs only showing .23.I‚Äôm not sure what happened in the previous two Nike app updates but I‚Äôve noticed my ‚Äúindoor runs‚Äù are no longer tracking properly. My Apple Watch is capturing my pace but not the actual miles: for example: I ran between a 9:15 and 9:45 mile for 5.5 miles but then the app will say I had a pace of 12:45. 

Please change back whatever weird indoor run update there was because this has been a bit frustrating.I‚Äôve used the app for years, and love the tracking and the coaching features are excellent. I didn‚Äôt know how much I was missing until I started using those features (I esp. love Coach Bennett!) BUT- cmon Nike- what is with the challenges and all the leaders logging over 250 miles PER DAY??? Physically impossible and very aggravating to us striving to actually do something. Please cut the challenges until you can monitor and boot those people out. #boycottnikechallenges",0,"Mixed FeelingsHumanizedAbsolute garbage!Best running app. Life changingThe best running partner I‚Äôve hadAlmost PerfcetPlease add time run started like the old old versionI love this app, however....Indoor Runs Not Properly WorkingLove the app, but challenges are a sad joke",Jennifer JosephErnestGrumblesGrubier coffee 1HAN-TYUMI-CyboogieJessica Elirhftwo2Tacobell993TbdicekatiemackattackCcccc123,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,3,0,0,0,1,10,1,1,0,1081,has_tracking,216

I did, and have been on a fitness craze, lost a good amount of weight, and decided for 2022 to set a new goal - run in a race. Starting small - signed up for a local 5K at the end of March, but knew I‚Äôd need to up my running more seriously. My son is a runner and uses Strava and another friend uses the Nike Run App, and others use watches, devices, etc. I do not have an Apple watch and no plans to get one, so I read up on best running apps. For beginners (which I consider myself running wise) the NRC was rated best, hands down. So after downloading it and using it for about six weeks, I can honestly say I love it. I love the tracking mechanisms themselves, the challenges and badges and the guided runs. I feel those have all helped motivate and challenge me - esp monitoring my pace WHILE running because it is easy to slow down and get sluggish (at least for me). Maybe I will outgrow this app one day, as another reviewer mentioned. I would love that because it meant I actually achieved some of the goals I set! Wish me luck on my race!I started using Nike Run to track my progress and it does just that. You input you goal, for example 2 miles, and while you‚Äôre running the app will keep you updated on each benchmark. On a 2 mile run the app will lower my music playing and tell me i‚Äôm halfway through meeting me goal! It‚Äôll say i‚Äôve reached 1 mile, my pace, and how much i have left to go. It‚Äôs very motivating and helpful. You can also play your own music from Apple Music directly on the app. Once you finish you‚Äôre run, it‚Äôll give you  all of the diagnostics. Your average pace, your elevation, your distance. This app has helped me keep track of all of my runs this past month and it‚Äôs great. Either i‚Äôm not too tech savvy or it doesn‚Äôt have the feature but i‚Äôd love to be able to use it on my apple watch and not bring my phone on my runs. If it does have this feature, let me know! Also, there‚Äôs been 2 or 3 times i‚Äôve clicked the start to track my run and a mile in i‚Äôll realize it hasn‚Äôt tracked anything although it says it‚Äôs tracking. Could be a problem on my end but other than that, great app. Appreciate the motivation & thought.ok so this app is THE BEST app i‚Äôve ever downloaded and honestly changed my life. i‚Äôve been using this app for a month now and let me tell you i keep discovering new features and have yet to find a SINGLE FLAW. the app is super easy to use, and has a ton of extra features i‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt know you needed. it has lots of motivating factors, such as the run levels, which are a great initiative to keep going on regular runs. everyone loves to level up right? the guided runs (narrated by coach bennett my king) make it super easy to start and finish runs, with coach bennett cheering you on (and sometimes andy my other main man) and with the predetermined distance or duration, you know what to expect. you can also join in weekly or monthly challenges with the whole nike run club community and the in app shopping feature makes it easy to find and purchase shoes and other gear. i highly HIGHLY recommend this app if ur starting to run more seriously or just looking for a good tracking app for ur runs. GET THIS APP it‚Äôll blow you away with all its extra features, layout, and accessibility. 10/10!!!I was never a runner and I‚Äôve been using the app for a little over a year, it has been so helpful keeping me motivated and on track.  I started off using it to get in shape, after a week of guided runs I ran my very first 5k in 24minutes. Then I decided it was time to train for a full marathon‚Ä¶ not the usual progression, but why not?  I used the marathon training program and ran my first full marathon in 4hr 24min.  I convinced my daughter to start training with the app and we ran our first half marathon 3 months after my marathon.  Since then I have used it train for two more half marathons and tracking daily runs. I have been consistently running better and feeling amazing.  It‚Äôs so easy to use, guided runs are awesome, training programs are setup really well and the mileage tracking for shoes is great! I would recommend this app for anyone interested in running for fun or wanting to train for events.This app has helped me break through my fear of training for a race.  It opened my eyes to new techniques and methods to enhance my cadence, core strength and stamina at a minimal expenses.  I have been able to better connect workouts to get my desired results.  I no longer feel the need to acquire a personal running coach... The running coaches on this app are great.  Their motivation words of encouragement through the workout come in handy and are right on time!  I love that all my vitals are available at a moment‚Äôs glance. Not to mention the pace and map tracking is on point.  I have been able to create new running routes on a daily basis.  All I can say is Great Job Nike!!
P.S. I am not tech savvy, nor app crazy. I am not a fan of using my phone when I run, until I ran into this app I still used an IPOD.  But this app has truly changed my life.  This app allowed racing to no longer be a hobby or a sport to me, but a way of life.   Thanks Nike!  Marathon here I come!!!I‚Äôve been using Nike run club since your needed a fob attached to your shoe. Back then I loved that it did a better job of tracking my miles than I did. Over the years, the features have expanded to include adding friends and social groups, phone and watch support, to running coaches and guided runs. It consistently beats the competition and you can‚Äôt go wrong using Nike Run Club. Add to all that the customer support is responsive and polite and you‚Äôve got one of the best fitness apps on the market. The only downside is the rest of the market! I‚Äôve not a true marathoner, I‚Äôm a triathloner and the compatibility with apps that track my swims and bikes just isn‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs not Nike Run Club‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs all politics and drama, but it would be great if Nike could branch out into some multisport tracking and put out an app as good as Nike Run Club but for bikes and swimming!I started using the Nike Running app back when you had to have special shoes with a chip in the sole and a wristband/iPod to connect to. That was back around 2006 or 2007, and thanks to the Nike app, I was able to start tracking my mileage and ultimately make better life decisions, a large part of that came from seeing my own progress. At the time I was out of shape, smoked too much etc. but once I started running, bit by bit, my life got better. Here I am some 15 years later, I still use the app and record all my runs. My fastest laps, my longest runs, all recorded and they really mean a lot to me. There were times I needed customer service, Nike was super helpful. Their shoes always do the job. And overall I just feel they make a great product. Thanks Nike, I have really gotten the most out of the app.Second update...still 5-Stars! 

Thanks for incorporating all of my suggestions from my first update! 

This time my recommendation is for speed runs, or any runs that incorporate a break, there should be an option for the mileage counter to continue tracking mileage. On some runs, I continue to light jog through the breaks, and it‚Äôs disappointing those steps don‚Äôt count towards my overall progress. 

Cheers!

Last review: 

Truly a 5 star app in every way except the following:

1. Need more guided runs. Once I started using them, I can‚Äôt stop and I‚Äôm getting tired of using the same ones over and over again.

2. Make guides runs both by distance and by speed. This will allow users to integrate them into training routines. 

3. Give half-way notifications at the half-way mark during guided runs so we know when to turn around! 

The next upgrade I would like to see would be ‚Äúsmart‚Äù integration with your run. For example, tell you how much time or how many miles you have left. Tell you what your pace is, etc...

Overall, I highly recommend this app for all types of runners and will continue using it happily despite its VERY MINOR missing elements.First let me say that I‚Äôm not the kind of person that ‚Äúlikes to run‚Äù. My fastest mile ever was a 7:06 but that was right out of basic training where all we did was run. Usually I run around an 8-9 min mile. 
After realizing I‚Äôve been using the app since 2009, I figured I should review it since I like it so much. I like that it shows my live run metrics in large fonts and now even tracks my heart rate when I wear my Apple watch. 
For anyone curious, if you start a run with the phone app, it will also start tracking your HR as long as you have an Apple Watch on and linked to the app. 
I‚Äôve also used the Watch app away from my phone to track and it works flawlessly. It‚Äôs worth noting that I‚Äôm using a series 4. I had a series 3 that was honestly useless when it came to running apps.Love it! Keeps me running every day. Wish there was a feature with maps where you could map out a run in advance of starting your run... otherwise it has everything you need corrected many of the issues I mentioned in my previous review, so I am actually very pleased with the current version. You still have the edit your shoe selection after each run, cannot designate a favorite shoe, and cannot delete old shoes. 

On the brighter side, the run tracking has become much more consistent and the leaderboard charts among your Nike network contacts are accurate actually update properly making this a really cool way to connect with competitive friends. 

Overall, much better than before and certainly the best free running app out. 

Used to love this app, but the recent update makes it unnecessarily difficult to use. They greatly diminished the actual attractive social features of this app by making it very challenging to interact with your real friends and compare activity. In place of that, they produced a half-hearted attempt of user interaction that stars a newsfeed of irrelevant running posts. It's now harder to modify standard settings, add friends, and just enjoy the app. Trim it downI‚Äôve used this running app consistently for the past three-plus years. It has reliable run tracking and compiles the stats for each run in an easy to view format. Plus, there‚Äôs tons of runs to choose from: by distance, time, guided runs, etc. so there‚Äôs always something to keep you motivated. I also like the challenges where you can run with other NRC members towards a specific goal in a set amount of time. And it‚Äôs very customizable, so you can adjust the settings exactly to your preference for music, audio stats during your run, and more. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend theNike Run Club app to any other runners, regardless if you‚Äôre just starting out or are an avid runner.I‚Äôve been using Nike+ Run Club for the first year I should say yeah I got it back in January at the beginning of the year and it‚Äôs been awesome. I love seeing how far I‚Äôve gone for the whole year it‚Äôs also fun to invite my friends too. Sometimes we will all set a big goal and then will divide it up Miles wise it‚Äôs fun to complete that Cole is a group. It‚Äôs also a lot of fun to see were people around the world have been running. The applications coaches have been very helpful as well I introduced the app to my wife she loves it we got her friend on it I got my sister-in-law on it and it‚Äôs been awesome being able to look at each other‚Äòs here miles for the months it‚Äôs a great app I‚Äôm never had any issues with tracking or anything love it.I‚Äôve been running with Nike+ RunClub and the Apple Watch app for the past few weeks and have to say I love it. Definitely an essential app if you are a runner, and even more so if you have an Apple Watch.

Pros:
-Accurate run tracking (splits, elevation change, etc.)
-Challenges to keep you motivated to run
-Social feed to connect with friends
-Share directly to social media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
-Guided runs with famous athletes like Mo Farrah and even one with Kevin Hart
-Automatically pauses runs if you stop 
-Very accurate heart rate tracking during run from watch 
-Achievements to unlock, records fastest 1K, farthest distance covered, longest run, etc.

Cons:
-In my personal experience I‚Äôve had some difficulty syncing runs when I initiate them from the watch. If I initiate the run from the app on my phone it syncs everything perfectly. However I‚Äôd have liked to be able to just press start on my watch and have it sync just as well.

All in all it‚Äôs the perfect app for any runner and the experience is even better if you have an Apple Watch. Plus, it‚Äôs free so you have nothing to lose. Definitely give it a shot!This app is awesome. Guided runs, personalized programs, helpful articles, show life tracking (and discounts on Nike run gear when you buy through the app)!!! I had never run more than three miles and now am up to an extremely comfortable 8 within my first 8 weeks, and doing it faster than I ever thought possible. The guided runs are enjoyable and always make me want to get out and after it the next day too!  One knock is, it doesn‚Äôt always sync perfectly with my Nike Apple Watch, so most of the time I have to pull the phone from its secure pocket to make adjustments, or just run my Apple fitness tracker at the same time. Other than that though, A++This app is a solid, I mean solid five stars, just exceptional. Not surprised at all to be honest, I have had the same experience with all of Nike‚Äôs apps. Works great with Apple Watch and as far as I know on others as well. The GPS tracking function not only tells you how far you‚Äôve run, but gives you a whole map. It is also smart enough to pause the workout when you are not running, and resume it when you are. It announces every mile, along with the time and pace. Competing with friends on here is also a great experience. Not to mention you can track how many miles you‚Äôve run in each pair of shoes you have, and this extends beyond just Nike shoes. Solid five stars, nice work Nike!!!Been running off and on for over a decade now. The whole time I‚Äôve been running my mentality is to make sure I‚Äôm going 110% every time I run. Which in turn makes me hate running but still doing it anyway. Had great motivation from this app to change my mentality where I look forward to running now, and completely changing my outlook on how I approach it. Definitely worth the download if you‚Äôre looking for some beginner information, or intermediate runner trying to get back into it. Great for tracking runs and finding good workouts for running/sprinting too if you‚Äôre not into the motivational stuff either.Hard to believe, but I think I‚Äôve been using this app for over 10 years now. I‚Äôve tried other running apps, but keep coming back to this one. It‚Äôs gotten even better in the past few years with guided runs and programs, although the programs are more limited now. This is part workout motivator, part therapy for me. The coaching in the guided runs is great, and sometimes they say exactly what I needed to hear and turn my week around. THANK YOU for continuing to innovate on this app. Great for tracking runs and stats, and for me, providing motivational runs to get back out after stretches of no running.I didn‚Äôt know that he could make me believe in myself the way that he does everytime he says I‚Äôm a bad*** or an absolute beast. Heck I‚Äôm an ocean away but his pre-recorded tracks just feel way too real.

The personalization on this app from tracking how far you‚Äôve gone in each of your shoes to being able to create a club to track your progress with your friends is pretty dang awesome.

I play Ultimate Frisbee and I‚Äôve gotten my friends to play along with my little obsession with this app. We compete and push each other (to a borderline morally acceptable extent) and I couldn‚Äôt have found a better app to do the job.

Coach Bennet, you don‚Äôt know me; but your voice has become the internal belief monologue within my very sole/soul (running pun ;). Transforming my feet to go further than I thought it ever could.

P.S. I‚Äôve never been bored listening to your rambling. In fact, I feel like it‚Äôs your secret weapon to make me run further and harder :)

Coach Bennet, I just needed to say that, in fact, you‚Äôre the bad***.I was looking for a tracking app for running, and when I saw that this one didn‚Äôt have in-app purchases, I downloaded it, thinking it would only be a pace clock and distance tracker. I was wrong, and I‚Äôm glad I was because when I opened it, I saw just how much more it really was, and I was baffled that this is all for free. It finds so many ways to keep you motivated, not only by the quality coaching, but by reading the Feed, completing achievements, challenging your friends, and so many other features that I haven‚Äôt even seen yet. I‚Äôm so happy I found this app, and I hope anyone that reads this at least gives it a try.The Nike run app is one of my favorite apps that I downloaded so far. If you just wanna run on your own or have a guided run with the coach this is a perfect night for that. I started off with a the guided runs. The guided runs gives you a coach to help you along the way.  coach  talking to you and  keeps you motivated as you run. Although I have moved on from guided runs the app still gives other great benefits. Like tracking how many miles you run on your shoes to help you to know when to replace them. The only thing I wish they would allow you to listen to podcasts while running. Other that, this app is perfect for runners of all caliber.The is the best running App in the universe. The guided runs are extremely helpful and super motivating. Big shout out to my favorite running guide, Coach Bennet. Huge fan of running with headspace as well. 

Constructive feedback:

I dont think the achievements for streaks is running. Also i just don‚Äôt understand how the streaks work. Adding a short description about what the runner had to do to achieve the streak would be helpful for bragging and motivating or a combination thereof. E.g how many time a week does one have to run to keep the weekly streak going? Similarly how many days out of the month does one have to run to continue the streaks?I‚Äôve had this app since it‚Äôs infancy in 2011. After trying so many other brands and workout trackers, I always come back to this one. It is possibly the best free app for tracking runs, monitoring goals and keeping me motivated. 
Coach Bennett and the rest feel like extended family at this point, and I can always make my day a win by listening to the guided runs and aiming for a club challenge goal. 
Complete enough runs in a month, and you might be surprised with Nike store discounts or exclusive sales. This app is a must for all runners, and I cannot recommend it enough.I was at my lowest around the summer of this year (2020) and I lost most of my fitness, body shape, etc. I despised running because of how hard it was for me before and I never really had a running partner for me to push through with. I saw this app when I was downloading other fitness tracking apps and I started with using one of the guided runs. Instantly, I felt engaged and running for the first time felt FUN. That whole week I ran for 20+ minutes a day and by then I was hooked. It‚Äôs been 2 months now and I‚Äôve dropped 20 pounds, been able to run multiple 5ks and 10Ks a week and I will never stop running.I started using this 3 years ago when I was looking for a 5k training program for my teenage runner.  I tried it out for a month to see if it would be helpful and it was. 

I liked it so much I began using it and have run eight 5K races over the last 18 months with great success. I first followed the 5k training plan but now I mix guided runs up on my own. 

The coaching is great, the workouts are dynamic and the music is pretty good too if you choose the Nike playlist. 

Tracking of goals and the data details of a run is really good for me, again I‚Äôm just a weekend warrior. I use this app on my phone and drop my phone into a pocket of my compression shorts and it tracks everything well. 

My only ask is a 5k training program 2.0.

 Other than that I can‚Äôt say enough great things. 

Thank you to the virtual Coach Bennett who has guided me through hot days and tough runs and most importantly race day. 

And thank you to all the coaches on here, you make a difference and I thank you.I‚Äôve been interested in a premium membership, but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was worth it. So, I was exited when it was made free for everyone. Since my track season isn‚Äôt happening, I‚Äôve been using the MyCoach feature, and I‚Äôm loving it! I also like that the app can tell me how far I‚Äôve ran even without wifi(I don‚Äôt have data). I don‚Äôt know what that works but I like it. The achievements also keep me motivated. The show tracking is also great, and I no longer have to keep track of the miles on paper. There isn‚Äôt a thing about this app I dislike. And premium will definitely be worth it once coronavirus goes away!I‚Äôve used so many running apps over the years and I always come back to Nike+ Run Club. The gps tracking is always the most accurate even if I‚Äôm running on a remote beach or in the middle of a big city. The adaptive training plans are probably the best feature and help me stay motivated in my running journey by providing me with variable workouts for the days I choose. The only negative is that it would be great to have more features to include friends. Having someone I know to directly compete against during the week would definitely give me more motivation to complete my workouts each week. Overall, Yay NRC!Haven‚Äôt run regularly in a while.  NRC is great for me tracking stats and progress.  The audio for the run is also great to inspire and keep you focused.  Also like that I can add notes/thoughts on each run like a mini review.  For me it‚Äôs helpful to jot down how I was feeling, conditions of that run, what I should do/don‚Äôt do next time.  

I didn‚Äôt  need a lot from an app to return to reg running.  This was great for that but has more tracking/customization for when I get fully back into things.  It‚Äôs easy to use, intuitive (for me) and looks to have other functions I can grow into in the future.  Thanks!You cannot beat the support, tracking, encouragement and awesomeness in this app‚Ä¶for FREE! I am doing the half marathon training program and listening to the guided runs. I‚Äôve done three other half marathons and I am the most prepared for this one. The guided runs, training plan and tracking set you up to show up on every run at your best. You understand the purpose of every run and really embrace slowing down to recover and speeding up to challenge yourself. I‚Äôm grateful for this app and this sport. I love it more than I have in the past! Thank you NRC!Been running with the Nike app for about 4yrs now and I really enjoy it. I like feeling like I have some company on my run and the guided runs make that happen. They are motivating and some of them are really fun too.

The one thing I don‚Äôt like that I wish it had was a days run streak counter. Right now I‚Äôm a month in on running every day. I wish it tracked that. Also wish there were a few more of the guided runs that pause in the middle to do exercises. But neither of those are big deals.

Five StarsAwesome app, love all the features outside of the actual mile and pace tracking‚Äîlike being able to heckle my friends, have a personal running coach, follow Olympic runners‚Äô programs, and draw inappropriate shapes on a map, 

Seeing the graphical representation of my runs is also really cool. 

Only reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars would have to be the crashing immediately following a coached run. As I am getting the verbal summary of the exercise and rating difficult, the app has quit three times in a row. All my data is still recorded, but it‚Äôs a pain to have to be kicked out and restart the app.This app gives me motivation! I love it !! At first i was like ‚Äúi guess i‚Äôll use this app‚Äù

i‚Äôm the type of person who in video games i like to get all achievements... so when i saw that this app had achievements to unlock i was hooked! every day i try to run to get the streak achievement, i also try to run faster everyday even if it‚Äôs by split seconds i still want to beat my previous record. and i love the challenges too! amazing app honestly, if you want to run and record√© your run i highly recommend giving this a try! you‚Äôll be hooked instantly!I had always been a casual runner, but this app has inspired me to be so much more consistent and aware of my progress. The guided runs with Coach Bennet are AMAZING. With them, I have my very own coach in my ear motivating me, giving great advice, and cracking jokes. I‚Äôve also learned a lot about proper running and staying safe. The run tracking and analytics are great. My only complaint is that sometimes the music is too loud over the talking. I recommend the app to all my running friends, it‚Äôs really made me look forward to my runs!I LOVE this Nike app!!!!  I recommended it to all my friends and they love it!  I use it several times a week - every time I go power walking. It's great to see the map when I'm done, especially when I'm traveling!!  Hoping Nike tech reads this as my only request is that the app needs to be fixed so it doesn't stop tracking your run when you get a phone call.  I have to remember to put my caller on hold and then take my run off pause and then ho back up my call. Not cool - please fix. But everything else is awesome!  Thanks Nike!!I started running a few years ago with the NRC app. Since then I‚Äôve logged over 1,200 miles with it and used it to train for and complete my first Marathon last fall. After trying several other running apps, I‚Äôve found this app is, hands down, the best running/training app available to date from any developer. The metrics, guided runs and training plans are invaluable to anyone interested in tracking their progress from beginner to professional.I‚Äôm a big Nike guy and I enjoy this app a lot. I‚Äôve been using this app for years to record my run and journal them as well as keep some data to track. I really have enjoyed the guided runs lately. It‚Äôs been great to get me going to try to work on my speed as well as just motivating me. I like the usability of the app too! It‚Äôs easy to use most of the time and it‚Äôs just got a sleek look to it. 

I will say though, if Nike is listening I have some thoughts. 
-Do as much tracking for treadmill/indoor runs as for the outdoor runs such as run details/splits. 
-there‚Äôs only two training plans. Please make more for those that want to run different distances (1mi, 5k, 10k, etc.) and training plans for speed. While I‚Äôm on the training plans‚Ä¶ make it work on the Apple Watch! 
-Give more unique challenges. The usual 15k, 50k, 100k challenges are there but give us more of the unique challenges.I have been very pleasantly surprised with this app. Over the summer I wanted to start running to keep in shape and whatnot, but it was pretty hard to keep motivated to wake up every morning and go run. Being able to look at my stats after a run is game changing. It motivates me to keep a running streak up, and helps to pinpoint parts of my running I need to improve. I don‚Äôt really ever use the guided runs, I‚Äôd rather just listen to my music, but if your into that there‚Äôs like a million of them on here. 
Great app!!There might be some glitches in the GPS tracking, even the ability to pull up old data... but the guided runs, especially for sprints and fartleks, make everything else minor.  These motivating focused runs help me work through plateaus like nothing else. Why bother getting a personal trainer, when I have a coach in my headphones to help me gauge efforts and pacing?   If you are concerned about pinpoint accuracy in distance, maybe this isn‚Äôt the app for you. But if you‚Äôre looking for the motivation of a private coach, this is perfect.This app has been absolutely wonderful. Tracking the distance, the course, the pace, heart rate and more. This app has been a tool that has helped me enhance my running level and the way I train. The only thing I can think of to improve the app is to be able to voice activate the start/stop of the run on the watch.  When it‚Äôs cold and wearing gloves this would be nice, also when it rains and the screen is slightly wet. Overall this app is incredible. I highly recommend it for anyone with an Apple Watch who runs at any level at all.As a member of Nike Run Club for a little over a year, I gotta say that it is the single greatest motivator for a guy who has nobody to run with. I‚Äôve gone on and off in waves with activity level, but now I‚Äôve been tracking daily runs and seeing steady improvement with each one, even if only slightly. And that‚Äôs the edge, it makes every small improvement feel significant due to the precise metrics it gives you after every run. 10/10 would recommend, would give 6 stars if I could.This is the best app if you want to track all your progress(miles) for running. It stops legit when you stop and continues when you start again. Very accurate and HIGHLY recommend if you are a runner. This app also provides some running challenges so if you‚Äôre ever bored of running straight, this app will give you a challenge that will be on the same level. No need to click or keep tracking the time. It does it for you! Let‚Äôs you know when you hit your target.I love this app, I‚Äôve been using it on and off for several years now. What sets it apart from other running/tracking apps is the guided runs, in my opinion. Very high quality and clearly a lot of work goes into each one to make them fun, inspiring, and motivating. It‚Äôs so valuable to have a coach in your ear while running, and the coaching style of this app is incredibly positive. For me, this app has gotten me to enjoy running, not just run reluctantly.I‚Äôve tracked my runs with this app for years (originally running with my phone now with Apple Watch) and it‚Äôs progressively evolved to the great app it is today. From speed, route tracking, heart rate and adding the specific shoes currently in use, it has almost everything I need. 

Something I‚Äôd like to see added is recovery heart rate automatically tracked at the end of my run, one minute then two minutes after and saved in the run stats.I downloaded the app to train for my first 10k. I laughed when the coach said "" you're a runner, you can do this."" I'm not a runner, I thought. The training mode had a variety of runs that kept me interested; and with no race ahead of me now, I do run twice a week 3 miles each time. The app helps me achieve a sense of satisfaction, tracking my pace and mileage. It also tracks my total mileage. I use it on an IPhone 5. It was a little buggy in training mode, but just tracking runs, it is great.Download this app. Period. From general tracking with pace and distance of runs and walks, guided runs, to the awards you can earn for no more than self-satisfaction, I can honestly say this app changed my life.
It‚Äôs helped me slim down and made me a runner. A sedentary life is easy to fall into in today‚Äôs society and it‚Äôs near impossible to find motivation to get up and do SOMETHING everyday. The coaches genuinely make me feel accomplished and push me to enjoy it and not just suffer through a run. 
It‚Äôs generated an interest in the world of track and field/ XC, I didn‚Äôt find it interesting prior and now I find myself watching all the incredible moments runners like Kichoge, Mo F, and others have accomplished.
If you want to change your life....you just have to meet your coach at starting line. 
Honest review from 28AUG17- 08JAN19.
Thank you Nike+ and Coach Bennett!I've been using the Nike running app to track my runs since 2013. While I've had a couple minor issues with it over the years, overall it's very functional and great for long term goal tracking. It's been wonderful to rack up the miles over the years, plan routes on the web platform, and achieve milestone after milestone. Love that you can track shoe mileage- I would never remember to replace my shoes without it. I used this app to train for my first 5k, 10k, half marathon, and marathon.I have used this app since 2013 and over the years I have seen a lot of great improvements to it! I can use this, my music app, and interval app all at the same time when I run and I really do enjoy it. I never have an issue with it not tracking or finding my maps or anything. This app really gets the job done and makes tracking miles less stressful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever not use the Nike Run Club to guide me on my workouts!I have been using the app for years and finally paired it with an Apple Watch. Although set up was pretty challenging‚Äîtook about an hour‚Äîonce I was up and ‚Äúrunning‚Äù I was really pleased with the functionality. I used to have to carry my iPhone on my runs but now I just use my watch and some wireless headphones. It‚Äôs made my runs much more enjoyable. The tracking and heart rate monitor function of the watch and the app together are excellent. Highly recommend the app and the watch.For 29 years I had the limiting belief that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a runner‚Äù, and that my body is built more for speed and power than it is for distance. Covid-19 changed things, as I decided to challenge myself. I downloaded the app strictly to track my runs, but I get so much more. The trainers motivation, the accuracy with the tracking, the timer, it syncs with my music.... I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to take up running without such a great companion. 10/10 !!!!I love the feature set and the interface. My only complaint is with the Apple Watch. Sometimes while tracking runs on the Apple Watch, the app stops working mid run, or the data gets really mixed up. I've had runs stop on their own, or the splits get really weird on a long run. On a half marathon, it showed several miles at 15 minute pace and then the rest of the miles at like an 8 minute pace when my actual speed didn't vary much at all.I‚Äôve been using Nike Run Club for over a decade. I‚Äôve tried several other apps in the process, enjoyed a few of the others as well. But for dependability, and for long term tracking I love Nike. My runs get recorded and you get ‚Äúbadges‚Äù for running certain miles and on certain days. It has different levels that you strive for and in my lifetime I plan to achieve them all. Love Nike Run Club & I immediately recommend it to new runners.This app is great for tracking your run mileage and routes. 

The only thing I wish they would implement is in the challenge portion of the app with a group you should have the option to view other people‚Äôs run stats. Like the time, and pace and maybe even the route if that‚Äôs not too personal. I think some people in the challenges are fabricating there distances for example riding a bike instead of truly running. 

But other than that it‚Äôs an excellent app!I never leave reviews however after over a year of use the Nike run club app deserves it it‚Äôs up there with google maps as far a utility on my phone from tracking my runs distance and pace to the affirmation and motivation from many different trainers after each workout it meets and exceeds my needs it even tracks my mileage in my shoes with exact variation and color wayI love NRC app!!! It motivates me to keep running each week, I am able to look back at all the data of old runs, months of progress, and to goals I would like to reach in the future. Other runners and I encourage one another by screen shooting the GPS tracking of our runs and many of my friends have started using it as well!!!

I recently started running and came across this app and in theory it was just what I needed to set goals and stay accountable, however, this app will not let me be great. I was two weeks into the get fit plan and I received a notification to adapt my plan, which means to change pacing suggestions and running distances. When I did that, I noticed that runs I had completed thus far were showing up as missing. So I went to the section of runs where it said action needed. I intentionally had let them sit there because when you add them to the MY coach function it just summarizes your run details instead of a lap by lap break down. I attempted to apply them to my plan and it just threw everything off so I decided to just abandon the plan and start over and to my dismay Nike Run no longer offer the my coach feature. What a HUGE disappointment!! My plan is now lost forever and there is no way to finish what I had started. I will not be speaking highly of this app to others and trust and believe as soon as I find a plan that can customize for me I will be deleting this app. I will do my best to replicate the plan I started with what‚Äôs left but losing my coach was a big hit in the gut. Do Better Nike.I've used this app for over 3 years and love it. But I made the mistake of updating to the latest version this week and it won't show my map of where I ran. I live in a very rural area and sometimes if I'm running a route I've only ran once or ran with another person once I take a screenshot of the map to make sure I don't get lost. Now it doesn't show me anything but where I started and stopped and the tags of where my miles along the route are. It's really driving me nuts! Also, the buttons for volume of music are SO small on the screen you pretty much have to stop running just so you can skip to the next song. Make the buttons bigger do you can just tap them
WHILE running please!
Fast forward 2 years: not much has changed. Sometimes the app won't respond at all to tapping start. The other day I started a run with music through the app, the app crashed, however the music kept playing (music app wasn't even on, ONLY through nike) so it didn't track any of my run. Won't allow me to change goals since 3 runs ago so I'm forever doomed to run 13.1 foreverüôÑthank god my Fitbit always comes through as a backupThis an an average app for run tracking and was designed for novice/off and on runners. My runs rarely synch with the app until after my next run. Some runs never synch, so I have to add them (big thanks to the Apple activity app for actually tracking my runs). The app crashes multiple times per week. The NRC app on my Nike+ Apple Watch S2 is extremely laggy and also crashes. It wasn‚Äôt like that when I first got the watch, but after a few NRC updates it began to freeze and crash. The My Coach feature is average at best. It doesn‚Äôt factor in warmup and cool down into your weekly mileage goals. It also doesn‚Äôt give you the option to customize your plan (after it has been created), aside from shifting days around within the same week. I‚Äôm giving this app 1 star because it drives me INSANE when my runs take days to synch when the Apple activity app synchs EVERY run immediately!I loved this app over a year ago.  I bought a Nike Ô£øwatch series 3.  It was always reliable and did awesome at tracking and syncing with phone.  It actually helped me to start running regular and consistently.  Fast forward to the last few months and upgrades.  I can never get this watch to sync with my IPhone X.  I‚Äôm always looking for a new update and hoping the latest one will fix.  It never does and all support ever tells you is to delete app and reinstall.  I‚Äôve done that at least over 20 times.  I no longer start my runs with the watch cause they won‚Äôt sync with phone and count toward goals.  So you just use phone.  Sadly I‚Äôm to the point of moving on to another way to track besides Nike.  The app was good but anymore it has turned into a lite version of the Nike sell you something app.  Nike you had a good thing going and let it run away from ya.This app is pretty good overall. I like the guided runs and most of the features however the indoor runs are so frustrating. I live in an area that snows and ices over frequently in the winter, so normally have to take my runs inside. When I run inside I use my phone to watch Netflix, which means the app doesn‚Äôt calculate my mileage. No problem- I edit the run to have the correct time and distance. However  the app assumes I‚Äôm lying, and  those runs don‚Äôt count toward any of my challenges and goals I do with friends and coworkers, which is just ridiculous. I shouldn‚Äôt be judged for running indoors by an app, and I want all my challenges to reflect how far I‚Äôve actually ran. Please fix this so that indoor runners have options to keep up with challenges, which are a main motivation for me.Really sad Nike got rid of the customizable plans. The plan options are too limited now. Also, I dislike the fact that you must start the run from the app in order for it to ‚Äúcount‚Äù in your plan. Before, you could assign a completed run to a particular workout. Also, I think I remember that the old app features gave you goals for each run. It was so much easier to be accountable before. 

App works fine but I‚Äôm confused about why they got rid of the superior plan functions. Without those functions, I‚Äôm not sure why one would chose this app over other apps on the market. Am I missing something??

1. When opening the app on your phone, there is a section where you can fill out personal data (height, weight, age and fitness goals) and Nike will customize a fitness plan just for you. It sounds great. Problem is, there is no way to start a run from ‚Äòmy coach‚Äô on your Apple Watch. (You can start a generic run and then transpose the info into the phone app, but the none of the guided runs will match what ‚Äòmy coach‚Äô wants you to do so the data will be off. 

This means you will need to carry your phone with you while you run if you wish to complete the run that was specifically set up for you.  I would be ok with this, except, if you start a run on your phone, your watch doesn‚Äôt recognize the run and some data, such as heart rate, will not upload to the phone. 

Not being able to take advantage of Nike‚Äôs ‚Äòmy coach‚Äô plan is a major flaw in my eyes. I‚Äôm not sure why they can not fix this with an update but the problem has persisted for some time. The app is really cool and has potential but I can not use it because of the problem with the ‚Äòmy coach‚Äô section.I have over 10 years of data on the NRC app, and never before had I experienced this issue over and over again on consecutive runs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the same issue occurs: you compete a run, hit pause before you officially stop or end your workout and BOOM! Everything disappears, there is run data to sync or history of your run and the Apple rings just overtake the iwatch screen. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP! Otherwise, there is truly no motivation to have this app or to use it. All my data can be created and stored with any other device or app, which is important when you are seeing to meet and exceed challenges and goals you have for yourself. THANKS!The app puts together a plan for you which seems great, but if you want to change a day a workout happens it is a pain and sometimes just doesn‚Äôt register. Then there are the speed runs which asks you to do certain intervals but provides you with no coaching, and doesn‚Äôt even display the distance you‚Äôre running, so unless you‚Äôre on a track you just have to guess and manually hit ‚Äúlap‚Äù yourself. As a new runner looming to get into running distance more often this app really didn‚Äôt do what I was expecting, and I‚Äôm using 5K runner now which is much simpler and gives clear cut goals without tying them to certain dates on the calendar.",0,"Good idea, but needs significant work.July 2021 Updates = Syncing IssuesNot",A_jestshaanrmTNTisKING,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,510,has_goals,70

I‚Äôm disappointed because I like the guided runs and training plans the app offers but I can no longer overlook it‚Äôs other issues. I have an Apple Watch series 3 and it is nearly impossible to sync my runs between my watch and phone. Lately any run that I start from my watch is deleted which is especially annoying with speed runs in which it is much easier to start and stop intervals from my watch. I‚Äôve lost my running streaks because of this inability to sync and any adaptability in my training plans. When runs are started from my phone my watch fails to sync and provide useful stats throughout or after the run. As I said previously, I love that the app offers free training programs for various goals. I used one of these to train for my first half marathon. However, I do have a few gripes. I understand that incorporating Nike Training Club workouts into plans gives both apps use, but it is difficult when you already have a plan on the NTC app. It would be nice to have the option to exclude these workouts from training plans or link your current NTC workouts. It would also be super useful to allow for the training plans to be customizable. Plenty of other apps already offer this feature. Until Nike can properly track and record my runs, I‚Äôm done.I love the coaching - especially Coach Bennett, but I‚Äôve enjoyed all of the coaching on all of the runs. 

The training plans are great. They give me goals, keep me for, keep me challenged - they‚Äôre great. 

I like to run with just my watch - so much easier than carrying my phone. It‚Äôs a Nike Run Club watch - it should work with Nike Run Club! But, although it shows the plans on the watch, you cannot actually access the plans on the watch. When you select the run for that day, it briefly shows the next screen and then reverts to the screen that shows the plan for the week. 

To follow a training plan on my watch, I have to find the next guided run by accessing the training plan on my phone. Then I can download it (often after scrolling through dozens of runs after hitting the the ‚Äúview all‚Äù button at the bottom of the guided runs page on my watch. Then I have to start the run somewhere close enough to my phone (locked in a car or a gym locker or a hotel room - real pain in the neck, but the watch cannot access downloaded guided runs unless it‚Äôs connected to the phone). 

I really love a lot of things about this so, but following a training plan with guided runs with just my Nike Rnning Club app takes a lot of effort (and then the phone never tracks that I have completed any runs on the training plan, but whatevs)The most recent update now caused my benchmark runs to crash today...twice. Maddening to say the least. My music randomly stops after about 3 minutes. Again, maddening. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to consistently start a run on my phone and have it show on my Apple Watch and track HR. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm doing the same thing each time. I love the guided runs, and I would love to see a guided run series that helps a runner establish good breathing. I like the training plans in general and how it gives me flexibility, but it would be nice if I could the end date of my training plan without having to end the plan I‚Äôm on and start completely over again. Goals change all the time and we need to be able to make the plan adaptable.I have been using this app since 2013 and have generally enjoyed using it. But overtime I have found that the updates will occasionally screw it up -- sometimes I start a run but then it doesn't record my times, or it will assume it will assume I have a ""goal distance"" and then say things like ""you have 2 miles to your goal"" when I actually haven't set any goals on the app.....it gets annoying....

I will probably still use the app, but just wish they did my quality testing before sending out new apps. 

I have tried the Strava app and it is starting to seem more appealing to me....record bike AND run timesI am not a runner and needed assistance to start running and maintaining my routine. I like the encouragement and guidance from coaches and the variety of runs and goals to choose from. 

Want to leave a 3 star review because 99% of my runs just cancel out about a minute or 3 minutes in, which is discouraging having to start over when you had a strong start. And at times runs do not get recorded. For example just finished a run, hit stop as usual and instead of the app going to analysis page, it went to run selection page and didn‚Äôt record my run. Otherwise, outside of glitches would‚Äôve given it a 4 or 5.",0,"Switching appsApple WatchEh, decent but needs some work.Good, but updates sometimes introduce new bugs!Great coaches",emily.t2SpacempGrimmy31Coyote kid–û–ª—è–°–ö,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,889,has_goals,70

Still a good app but I the distance calculations has been off quite a bit. I haven‚Äôt been shorted a mile on multiple runs. The app is tracking the distance but not calculating correctly, shorting me on my goals through the app.  Please fix. 
I have completed a 10K run thanks to this app and would and do recommend it to people. 

Updated 2/1 I‚Äôve began to follow a running plan.   Having an actual plan/coach on this app would be great vs. having to follow a PDF then find the correlating run. Also, the app has continuously crashed on me during my indoor runs. It‚Äôs not logging any of my runs when done inside. This is becoming very frustrating. I've enjoyed this app thoroughly. Ive recently started running again after multiple years of surgeries and injuries. have passed milestones for myself with this app! I've even considered trying a 10k. So thank you. Unfortunately there have been a few occasions when I've been running on the treadmill that the app crahses and doesn't log my run, which is really frustrating and unmotivating. Minus that the coaches are great and I like the different options to mix things up. If the glitches and not logging could be fixed this would be perfect.I love the personalized training plans to work toward your goals. I love the interface during my runs and that I can customize it to show me the info I want to see. 

But there needs to be a middle ground between the guided runs and no coaching. I like the coaches, but they talk a little too much during the runs and interfere with my ability to listen to podcasts or audiobooks, which I love to do while exercising. I want a little bit of coaching but I need to be able to more easily pause my podcasts rather than having the coaches talk over them and me having to switch apps. It‚Äôs weird that the app assumes you‚Äôre listening to music and only offers controls for that. A semi-guided run would be perfect to set me up for the runs and provide some encouragement while not taking me completely out of my podcasts or audiobooks.And although I stand by Nike and nothing else, this app has SO much potential that I think it‚Äôs not taking advantage of. Incorporating more of the social aspect would be better. Being able to interact w my friends on this app makes it more fun! But I can barely interact w them on here. The navigation is not very user friendly or necessarily at the point that it promotes engagement with one another. For example, a friend of mine goes running all the time but I can only occasionally ‚Äúcheer him on‚Äù through the app and support that he‚Äôs going for a run. For him, although I run twice a day every day, he never gets updates when I go for a run and he can‚Äôt cheer me on at all. If you could create a way for users to engage in friendly challenges to meet goals through the app that would also be great. I love this app and I LOVE Nike but I just wish there was more. ‚òπÔ∏èGreat app, I use it whenever I‚Äôve run, and I‚Äôve used it for almost a year now‚Äîso I really like it and i think it does a fantastic job, especially considering all the great features (shoe tracking, achievements, challenges, autopause, audio feedback, and more), but it has some serious problems.

Problems: General sluggishness. It often takes a bit to start up the run and will occasionally randomly pause and not start up until you do it manually. The big one is it glitches out and DOES NOT TRACK your whole run. I run the same route through Central Park everyday so I know about how far I‚Äôm running and it‚Äôs very frustrating when it only tracks 2 miles for the 7 miles I ran. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to hit goals and get accurate readings.

Some improvements: An option so whenever I auto pause I can hear the audio feedback about distance. The ability to have audio feedback tell me the time of day as well as the rest. Update the weird share feature to something more useful. I don‚Äôt know maybe modest Nike discounts for hitting certain milestones.

I never write reviews but I‚Äôm writing this one because I love this app, use it everyday, and want it to get better! Thanks Nike! :) #checksoverstripesI enjoy the app a lot but a few kinks: it will only tell my average pace despite choosing for it to tell me my current pace. I dont want to delete and reinstall for fear of losing my data. Also, I dislike that edited runs or manually added runs don‚Äôt count towards goals/awards/achievements. My phone died at mile 22 during a marathon so I had to manually add it in. So now the app isn‚Äôt aware that Ive done a marathon so it‚Äôs not counted towards awards and such. Similarly, I ran a half marathon this weekend and for some reason it paused when I didn‚Äôt know it. If I had PRd then it would have replaced my prior PR but not it doesn‚Äôt recognize the run bc it thinks I only ran 12ish miles. I when I go into edit it it‚Äôs not going to count towards awards/achievements. Please allow this change!I have always loved this app, but a few tweaks would make it my perfect training partner! I am, unfortunately, not a great endurance athlete. I think features that would enhance the app would be individualized goals focused on training for new pace times and reminders at 0.5 mile increments. 
Also, even though standard American measure is the mile we cannot deny that many events are set at kilometer distances, so wanting to do a 10k would be made easier if we could switch units of measure.
I‚Äôm also a huge fan of the app CharityMiles which tracks my distance and time with certain activities (I.E. walking, running, and biking); I believe that partnering with other apps would be greatly beneficial to those like me who enjoy working out to benefit others!I love Nike Running Club, it has helped me to become a stronger, smarter runner. I‚Äôve trained for everything from a 5K to a full Marathon using NRC. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I got a little more dedicated to running where I noticed areas of improvement. I can‚Äôt say that NRC is the most accurate as far as time/distance ran. There are a lot of things that can throw off the accuracy of the GPS like running with your phone on low power mode in a pocket, but Nike makes products with pockets to put our devices in, so was a little frustrated when I ran my first marathon and learned that the app wasn‚Äôt the most accurate time. 

Also thin it will be beneficial to Nike if users can find running groups near them to crush their goals together. There are runners across the States and the world, and as someone who travels a lot I would love to join a team in the different places that I visit. The app has the feature, but it seems like it‚Äôs not used too much. 

Overall, a great app to get started with running, but as I become a stronger runner, I still want to see Nike being the best and #1 resource for me!I like that there are goals I can actually reach, and it requires enough input that I can keep going with it realistically. The glitches are annoying though. Sometimes the workouts do not sync so it looks like I did not do the hard work. There is a way to go back in which Nike told me about when I sent them a DM to complain about it. They responded quickly. But I believe those added in do not count toward the goals. Also, apple music often will not shuffle music on a playlist while the Nike app is on. It just goes in the order that you added the music. That said I will keep using this app.The app for the phone is the perfect run partner. I use the guided runs which give me feedback as I am running so that I can reach my goals. 
The only downside is that I bought the Apple Watch Nike edition and expected it to work great. It does not meet my expectations. The run data does not show on the watch when you start from the phone. And you can‚Äôt start the guided runs from the watch. If you are looking to use this app, use your phone don‚Äôt even bother trying the watch app.",0,"Good app.. few glitches.Need a middle ground between guided runs and no coachingBeen a HUGE fan of Nike since I was 12Great, but not perfectGood not greatA Few Tweaks to Make the Perfect AppGreat to get started.

I bought myself an Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è series 5 Nike Edition not to brag üòÖbut I got it as a fitness motivator since I like to keep track of data to see improvements. After I set up the Nike Run Club app and a nice pair of Nike running sneakers üëü I found myself wanting to run more and more. 
The coach is awesome it definitely helps with motivation specially if you‚Äôre a beginner. The tools you have in the app like the challenges are a great way to keep you from reaching your goals. The data is very detailed from heart rate to the pace of the run and of course the distance among other things. 
NOTE AND CAUTION: The only reason of why I gave it a 4 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è instead of 5 is because if by mistake you stop the current run on your watch and begin another, you can‚Äôt sync the two runs together. If you edit the info on a run manually like the miles or the time and you‚Äôre doing a challenge like the 15K it won‚Äôt count towards it. Other than that it‚Äôs great üëçüèº highly recommended for beginners.Recently, I wanted to get into running. The entire benefit of running had a lot to do with my choice of exercise. I read up on several running apps and most of them did not spark an interest for me. I ended up choosing this app because I was already Nike Club Member and why not give it a try. I started my first run with the ‚Äú Get Started Collection‚Äù and have been running ever since. The guided runs are awesome because I don‚Äôt get bored or distracted and I can‚Äôt actually get great tips on running. The challenges are also another great way for me to add extra runs in and to completes goals‚Ä¶and best of all‚Ä¶be proud of myself for doing it and making a commitment to myself that‚Ä¶yes I can do this! I‚Äôm planning to run a 5K and am currently running on this plan! I love running and I would have never stuck with it had it not been for NRC!I have attempted to transition to competing running apps but I always come back to Nike Plus Run. I started using it back when a sensor needed to be inserted into a compatible Nike running shoe. Since then, the mile-based level system has helped motivate me to make running a long-term habit. I do like that the display can be rotated for use with an armband. The developers seem to have made the app adaptable to runners with all kinds of preferences. The app keeps run progress if it closes out during a run for whatever reason. I am glad that they brought back the achievement trophies to inspire short-term goals. I hope they expand on trophies and challenges such as the Sunday 5K run. I would recommend it to anyone who runs on their own as I do.I love NRC. I use it every time I go for a walk or run. I gave it four stars because I do feel like it could use a few improvements. For example, I feel like the average pace meter is off sometimes‚Ä¶I also think they should add a feature where it can track your steps. I love how it connects to your music and that you can create goals. It‚Äôs great that it pauses your workout if you stop moving for about 5 seconds. Super easy to figure out and use. 
 
Hope this review is helpful to some of you. And I hope NRC will take my suggestions into account. Overall this is an amazing app and would totally recommend it to everyone.This App is amazing, I use it almost every day. It‚Äôs the best way to keep you running, since you can set your goals, and get some remainders. Also it‚Äôs great for knowing when to change your shoes after a good amount of miles. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving the 5 stars is because there is an knowing issue with the Apple Watch synchronization, this gets fix on a patch, but for some reason it comes back. I like the idea of just running with the watch, but it‚Äôs really annoying that after finishing your run, the run doesn‚Äôt show in the app and even worst it will disappear from the Watch. Please fix this!Overall I enjoy using the app with my watch to keep track of my runs and fitness goals as it is simple to use and visually appealing.  There is the occasional syncing issue that loses my progress or inaccurately calculates my distance ran, but I‚Äôve only had to reinstall the app once from +2 years of use. The app could be more customizable with notifications and goals. For example, goals on cadence or heart rate would be nice for specific workouts or when I want to work on my running form.I really enjoy running with NRC, but there is one feature that is either ‚Äúmissing‚Äù or I just don‚Äôt know how to use it.  I like running intervals.  That‚Äôs what works to help me achieve my goals.  What I would love to see is an option to build custom interval workouts that go like this:

Warmup:  manually start/stop

Interval 1-x:  manually start with auto stop/alert at the completion of programmed distance or time.  App displays full data for current/most recent interval.

Cool down:  manually start/stop

At end:  app displays full data for full workout, i.e.

Warmup
time, distance, avg pace, stopped t/d

Interval 1
time, distance, avg pace, stopped t/d

Interval 2
time, distance, avg pace, stopped t/d

...

Interval x
time, distance, avg pace, stopped t/d

Cool down 
time, distance, avg pace

Basically, I want to control when I start running, but I want the app to do the thinking for me.",0,"Almost perfect and excellent for beginners!!Great App to Get Into RunningMy running app of choice since 2012Great app. Would totally recommendFix the Apple Watch issueWorks well, but could improve a couple of thingsWhat I want in a running app",ElCarlosianLoves 2 search wordsPrimMadd‚ú®ùïÑùïöùï§ùï§ ùîπùï¶ùïüùïüùï™ùïùùï†ùïßùïñ‚ú®Ulises OrdunoSpence_WSFC Ward NG Recruiter,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,1010,has_goals,70

Some days it wants to log a run and other days it doesn‚Äôt. But when the app does decide to count one of my runs it‚Äôs very encouraging and motivating. But one time I had beat my 10K record, which I trained for for months, it didn‚Äôt count and the sync has been pending for almost six months now???? I stoped running for those six months because I was so upset. Now that I‚Äôm back it‚Äôs only my third run and it‚Äôs not keeping up or even counting any of my runs for the challenges nor are any of my stats consistent. For instance I ran for 45 minutes today and I did 2 miles. My splits reported back that my first mile was one minute and fifteen seconds while my second mile was over fourth five minutes long! Since the app produced such inaccurate results it doesn‚Äôt count toward any of my goals or competitions. I‚Äôm so over this.The last two back to back updates have changed all my times on this app. I have over 800 miles logged on this app and have been maintaining times and constantly improving my runs. But after the last two updates, all my times are anywhere from 20 seconds to 1 minute slower on average. I have even tried to purposely sprint to try and meet my previous goals and there is no way I can even come close. I don‚Äôt exactly know if it is my phone or this app, but do know it all happened after the last two updates, and every other function on my phone works perfectly. I haven‚Äôt received any feedback from any admin for the app either. What a shame to have to switch to another app. Very disappointed in what was such an amazing motivating tool for me for so long.I really like this app. I think I would love it if the coaching feature included warm up and cool down suggestions within the weekly mileage. Currently, it yells at me for doing ‚Äútoo many miles‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing inconsistent.‚Äù A minor complaint. 

Other minor complaints are: (1) challenges do not count runs that i‚Äôve edited. For example, i had to reduce the miles counted toward specific runs. Those runs were completely removed from my number in the challenges. (2) When it schedule NTC work, those do not count toward my training goals. So the weeks with NTC work schedules are marked as incomplete. 

A more significant concern is that the app never seems able to read my heart rate monitors, a problem i‚Äôve experienced for years. Every other running app reads my monitors with zero fuss. Why can‚Äôt NRC?I have been wanting to get back into running but have struggled with actually getting up and running. With the Nike+ RunClub app I have been able to start a plan and actually stick with it. I'm want to get faster and more in shape and with the running plan given to me I can already see my goals becoming reality. The only cons to this app are on occasion (once or twice) I have done a specific run for my plan only to not have it record as complete on my weekly schedule. This is extremely annoying because I have to rearrange the schedule to fit in the exact same run on a different day just so I can get it complete. This is only a problem if you are like me and want to fully complete the plan in the end.I was all set for a run today after taking a long break, due to injury. I pressed start and the NIKE app began to involuntarily pause and resume, causing several inaccuracies and frustration. Like other runners, I too rely on the most accurate readings to manage my progression towards my running goals. This app use to be user friendly and motivating. Now, there are to many buttons/options which are somewhat unnecessary. Love the coach option though... this new addition gets 4 stars. Simple is better!

I did, and have been on a fitness craze, lost a good amount of weight, and decided for 2022 to set a new goal - run in a race. Starting small - signed up for a local 5K at the end of March, but knew I‚Äôd need to up my running more seriously. My son is a runner and uses Strava and another friend uses the Nike Run App, and others use watches, devices, etc. I do not have an Apple watch and no plans to get one, so I read up on best running apps. For beginners (which I consider myself running wise) the NRC was rated best, hands down. So after downloading it and using it for about six weeks, I can honestly say I love it. I love the tracking mechanisms themselves, the challenges and badges and the guided runs. I feel those have all helped motivate and challenge me - esp monitoring my pace WHILE running because it is easy to slow down and get sluggish (at least for me). Maybe I will outgrow this app one day, as another reviewer mentioned. I would love that because it meant I actually achieved some of the goals I set! Wish me luck on my race!I have never been a runner. I exercise a lot, but rarely by running. Usually I go to the gym and get on an elliptical and read. As a law student it is the one time a day I get to read something I enjoy.

I am writing this at the end of week 1 covid-19. My gym closed 4 days ago and I knew if I was going to not go stir crazy I would have to make myself run. So I downloaded NRC to give it a try and just track my time and miles. 

The first couple days went better than I expected. Being able to keep track of my time and pace and distance I could set goals. I didn‚Äôt love it. I missed reading. But I enjoyed it more than I expected. I Then I tried a guided run. Instant love. I went to a basic first run. I instantly felt more confident in my pace and more encouraged. I no longer felt like this was something I was doing for my sanity being stuck inside all day but rather something I could come away feeling success and that I could continue to succeed. I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow‚Äôs run!Try it out and stick with it. Everything you need for running all in one place, no excuses. I love the app. Had it for a few years now and it‚Äôs improved every time I open it up. At first I wasn‚Äôt very consistent, but now I run every day. If running/walking is something you really want to get into this is it. You might fall off and not run for months at a time, but the app still holds on to all of your previous runs. Because I could look back and see how long it was since I ran, it surprised me and that‚Äôs what helped me start running again. If you have shoes you can search the shoes and add them to see how many miles you‚Äôve ran with those shoes on. The app allows you to set goals while giving you ways to achieve them. With challenges, adding friends, and coaching, it‚Äôs the ideal app for athletes and the ‚Äúnon athletic regular people‚Äù. Install the app and hold on to it. Have fun. üëçüèæüíØI‚Äôm really not a Nike fan. Yes they sponsor the greatest athletes in the world but I think they're overrated. I believe Nike is more about trend and style than they are about creating genuinely quality goods. There are always exceptions to the rule but it seems to me that there is always better equipment on the market. With all that said.....this app is fantastic. It‚Äôs very well formatted and easy to use. I love the navigation aspect of the app along with the achievements and goals that you can unlock/work for to stay motivated. I also really like the feed, where articles are written to better improve people‚Äôs knowledge about being an overall healthier and more superior athlete. The workout plans are also convenient, challenging, and makes the user feel like they‚Äôre receiving actual training from the best in the world.I never write reviews, but I had to share with others in my position what this app has done for me. This is my FIRST day running in many years, and I‚Äôm no runner. I‚Äôm relatively young, and I‚Äôve gained considerable weight over the last few years and I want to get back to a place where I can live an active life. My brother invited me to a half marathon in a few months, which seems more than impossible to me. But today I decided to try this out. I ran for the first time today and got to 2.9 miles, which is so crazy for me!! The guided runs are so helpful to me; having a professional to pace and chat with makes such a difference. I know it‚Äôs only the first day into this journey, but I know this app is going to help me achieve my goals. Give it a try!!I really enjoy this application, I find that the features are incredibly useful for just about any situation I come to. The meditation runs are some of my favorites and I recommend them to many. Running is a huge mental battle for some so being able to help their mental state and perspective towards runs can be a life changer. The medals, goals and challenges really help me a lot. I find myself always pushing to get the next one, or get to the next run level. (Currently orange, but one foot in front of the other and I‚Äôll get there.) so  I recommend this for runners who have been running for a long time and those who are wanting to make a small change in their daily routine. Whomever you might be, definitely join the club.Like any exercise app (or any app) this one is not perfect. However, it is easy to use, it tracks the pertinent data, and gives you digital rewards for achievements.

The draw backs for me are not important and do not affect my goals.

I would be nice if it were easier to connect with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (like maybe with a 3rd party app, or phone number - not just an email address). I have had to send my info to people I want to run with and have them find me because many times I  do not have an the address my friend have associated with their account. Searching by name is not a help if they don‚Äôt have a picture that can identify them easily.

It would also be nice if it would sync with the other devices I have chosen to use (fitbit for me). I refuse to buy new devices just to sync them all to one specific app. So technically certain information is not captured in this app when I run (heart rate). which would be nice to see all in one place, but again not completely necessary. I just open my fitbit app and viola.

Anyway, it‚Äôs a great run tracker and fun to use. I really enjoy joining and creating challenges with my friends and fellow runners across the globe.Just a great way to stay motivated to stick with your runs and help set and meet goals. Lots of cool features and the guided runs are a great way to get out and feel like you‚Äôre with company even if you‚Äôre running on your own which is the case for me most of the time. I am really enjoying the weekly and monthly challenges because it adds another layer of motivation and again, makes me feel like I am participating with a larger community even though I am usually running on my own. And even though it‚Äôs Nike and it‚Äôs all branded that way, I don‚Äôt feel like they are constantly just trying to sell me products or services and keep all the important features free of needless advertising or other gimmicks.I absolutely never write reviews on anything but this app is worth it if your contemplating downloading it. The last time I ran was in high school as a track and field sprinter, in middle I ran XC but as a current graduate student you can only imagine how out of shape I am now. However, with this app you go at your own pace, the reminders aren‚Äôt annoying notifications, the goals are REALISTIC and the guided runs are the BOMB. All in all it‚Äôs an amazing app that allows you to achieve any goal you‚Äôve set for yourself. This past weekend I ran 4.34mi and if you asked me last year or even last month if I would ever see myself doing it the answer would‚Äôve been a HARD NO. This is great app with great reviews for a reason!Nike Run Club has helped me reconnect with running and do so in a way where I‚Äôm excited (seriously, excited) for my runs. The guided runs are awesome and the coaching provided has helped me be a smarter runner and make so much progress all the while feeling really proud of myself and the process. 

The only thing I want is more training plans! I just finished the half marathon one and I‚Äôm like, what‚Äôs next? I want to be able to set different goals, like running a faster 5k or other fun targets to keep looking forward to. It would be awesome if I could find plans for that within the app rather than having to search outside the platform.Outstanding running app, I've used this app over two years and tried a few others in between just to have and see where I stand with the app.  However this app is amazing, motivation when you reach your goals, encouragement when it's been a few days since your last run... my recommendation is that from a marketing perspective I would collaborate more with Nike, and running clubs to reward members for reaching goals.  Everyone wants to workout however with add incentive you can push them further.  This will generate more attention to the app, stores and the free items will be advertised global on social media.  For more ideas reach out to me...I LOVE this app!!!! I am the worst runner ever, the slowest runner ever, and it‚Äôs actually sad sometimes how terrible I am at running. BUT if there is ever an app that could make me a decent runner, it will be this one!! They have workout plans (for free, might I mention) that are made for you surrounding your abilities and they don‚Äôt consist of unattainable goals or workouts that are just so far above my ability. Curated playlists accompany you on your run and a little voice comes through your headphones to let you know when you‚Äôre at the halfway point, your mile time, pace, etc. I absolutely love this app and recommend it to all levels of runners!!I have nothing but great things to say about this app. After 30+ yrs of not running I have begun the running journey again. I never thought I could get back to the level of running a 5K or even 5 miles at one time but here I am doing it. I ran in my first 5K and finished.  Coach Bennett and other running stars on this app help motivate you to keep going. I‚Äôve lost weight and built endurance. Many of my family and friends have commented that I look great or different. My goal is to keep running and keep setting goals all the while maintaining my consistency. Thank you Nike Run Club.I‚Äôve had this app since it‚Äôs infancy in 2011. After trying so many other brands and workout trackers, I always come back to this one. It is possibly the best free app for tracking runs, monitoring goals and keeping me motivated. 
Coach Bennett and the rest feel like extended family at this point, and I can always make my day a win by listening to the guided runs and aiming for a club challenge goal. 
Complete enough runs in a month, and you might be surprised with Nike store discounts or exclusive sales. This app is a must for all runners, and I cannot recommend it enough.I started using this 3 years ago when I was looking for a 5k training program for my teenage runner.  I tried it out for a month to see if it would be helpful and it was. 

I liked it so much I began using it and have run eight 5K races over the last 18 months with great success. I first followed the 5k training plan but now I mix guided runs up on my own. 

The coaching is great, the workouts are dynamic and the music is pretty good too if you choose the Nike playlist. 

Tracking of goals and the data details of a run is really good for me, again I‚Äôm just a weekend warrior. I use this app on my phone and drop my phone into a pocket of my compression shorts and it tracks everything well. 

My only ask is a 5k training program 2.0.

 Other than that I can‚Äôt say enough great things. 

Thank you to the virtual Coach Bennett who has guided me through hot days and tough runs and most importantly race day. 

And thank you to all the coaches on here, you make a difference and I thank you.Coming from someone that‚Äôs a total couch potato, I love this app. I took the initiative to start running, not to try and lose weight, but to build my endurance. I wanted to actually be able to run further without dying for air after just seconds.

When I first started my plan, I wanted to give up after two or three runs. I almost did too, but something in my clicked and I forced myself to lace up. Of course, I felt as if it was a chore. ‚ÄúI HAVE to run this much tomorrow‚Äù ‚ÄúI HAVE to go out today‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù
But I could. And I finally realized, I don‚Äôt HAVE to do any of it. I WANT to do it. This app tracks your distance, time, pace, elevation, and heart rate (if you have a watch, which I do not yet). You can compare your runs, and see how much better you‚Äôre doing. 
Of course I could still go out and run without it, but this app makes it worth while. I get motivated and set goals for myself everyday. 
I can really see a change in myself, after a month, and I plan to keep going. 
Best to all!I've had this app for years and have always loved it, but I was never really consistent with running until now. It is great for beginners and those who are more experienced. I RAVE about this to anyone that will listen. The challenges are a great way to keep you motivated and keep your reaching for new goals. I love that you can cheer others on while they're running and that you can view all your metrics in a very detailed fashion. You can control your music from your Apple watch (If you have one). It's great!! 10/10 recommend.This is my FAVORITE running app, and I‚Äôve had a few. Nike Run Club has so many options for how to take a guided run, so many challenges, and a ton of different ways to personalize your goals‚Äî ergo, personalizing your training to help you reach your goal. One of my favorite parts is that ITS FREE and even the Nike Pro just requires an email to access. They motivate you, remind you, and continually push you to keep going, go further, go harder, go faster. You can connect with friends and others going for the same goals and challenges. I‚Äôm really excited to work with Nike Run Club!This app revolutionized my running game. I went from barely running a mile every other week to running several miles most days of the week. Even did a half marathon just to prove to myself I could do it! Took forever, but did it!! The sense of completing a run is incomparable, especially after a rough day, physically or mentally. The coaches are so motivating and inspirational that I don‚Äôt think I would have accomplished my goals without them. So slap on your running shoes and get moving!! To quote coach Bennett, hardest thing is pressing start!The best app I‚Äôve ever used. You can track runs, get detailed summaries and stats, reach milestones, create goals and plans, and so much more. 
Best of all is the guided run series. Nike coaches and elite athletes from all over the world record guided runs to follow along. It helps your mind, form, speed, everything. It‚Äôs what finally made me a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù on the inside and out. They have runs for all types of distances, time, type (speed), and even a series for new runners. 
Highly recommend everyone run and everyone use this app for their runs!I love this app as well as the train app. It‚Äôs been helping me a lot during COVID-19. I gained a good amount of weight while in quarantine. I started at 115 pounds and nearly hit 140 pounds. 

Because gyms and I had a hard time figuring out home work outs. Now I‚Äôm 122 pounds and still trying to get back down to my original weight. 

This app works great on motivating you while you run. You can start easy then work your way up. 

NOW FOR THE MARKETING IDEA
The one thing that I really think could take this app up to the next level is giving the users coupons for Nike products when achieving goals. It would be great to receive 20% to 30% off products for completing things like running 5 miles or 10% for waking up at 5am to start running. 

It would give the users more reason to keep working out and using the app while promoting sales. Please do this. I would love to take advantage of sales for the work I have done!I got an Apple Watch two years ago to track my fitness goals, I got the Nike plus version so when the gyms closed down during quarantine I decided to take up running. This app has been so beneficial to me. Coach Bennett is by far my favorite-I‚Äôm just being biased, all the coaches are amazing and motivational-each coach has given me a tool, a thought, a drive to go further than before to crush my goals. The goals signifies within the app are also amazing and make you want to run more. Would highly recommend to anyone.I‚Äôve been using the Nike Running Club app for 10+ years now. And I‚Äôll honestly never try any other running apps until I reach Black! I‚Äôm a pretty big nerd at heart. And I love all the achievements you can get. I like to challenge myself so it‚Äôs a way to keep track of personal running goals. I love to compete with friends that hate losing as much as I do. It‚Äôs just a great way to motivate your growing number of running friends and keep yourself going‚Ä¶ Just a little farther than them!Just got this app a few days ago. I see no flaws in it. Its as if Nike truly cares for the health of people. Sure, perhaps they may market a few of their products through this app, but who says you have to buy them. If you are new to running, its easy. You set your own goals. The app just helps you succeed. I've not been a fan of running in the past, and of course its difficult, but this app helps motivate me. But don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Today is the day to begin a ""New You"".I‚Äôve been using this app for about three years.  It‚Äôs helped me stay motivated because I the king of person who likes stats and goals. The coaching is pretty good too. I‚Äôm using this app to train for my first marathon and I really like it. 

One  request to make the app even better:
It would be cool if the speed intervals had vocal cues for the intervals without the coaching.  I like to do the same interval workouts  but the same coaching track can get tiresome.I started running post recovery and could no longer play contact sports. The Nike+  running app made a training program possible for me since I could not afford training on top of gym dues.
Since my injury (and recovery) I have completed 3 Nike running events (SF x2 and Toronto) along with many others. If this app had not been around I would not be still attempting to run. I may never be a placing runner, but Nike running app gives me the help I need to keep hitting my distance, time and event goals. Thanks coach!This app has helped me develop a daily routine and start regularly striving for larger fitness and life goals. The guided runs and plans are just so easy to use and so helpful for someone who has never had any running training in the past. I‚Äôm  prepping for my second half marathon with it right now. Thanks Coach Bennet and all the other coaches on here and thank you all the devs who keep adding features and making it amazing!Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today without this app. It‚Äôs an amazing run tracker, you can see in real time all your run stats (miles, pace, time so far, BPM, calories). Seeing those numbers and being able to see my previous runs and my progress have really kept me running, and the achievements section gives tangible goals and tells you when you‚Äôve broken your records. I got this app to start running and now I may never stop.I love the app so far. I can track monthly mileage and set goals.  It also allows for indoor work out plans so you don‚Äôt have to get creative yourself. 

My only 2 drawbacks:

1. The way your run will post to Social Media when you want to brag about your run. It only shows the route and distance. No total time or average pace. That would be cool to show on there as well to be able to give the entire story to your friends regarding your run. 

2.  The way you have to start the run from your phone and are unable to do it from the Apple Watch when using the app in order to hear your updates while you run even when the watch is connected via Bluetooth to your headphones.  A little nit picky I know but it should all be able to connect and work as one.With both this app and Nike‚Äôs training club app I have been able to elevate my fitness goals and achieve more than I thought I‚Äôd be able to. The user interface is nice and simple and the coaching during workouts is great. 

I really hope this continues to be a service provided for free, I‚Äôve told so many people about it and I‚Äôve seen them improve their health exponentially. 

Thank you for providing this service and making it available to people regardless of income!I‚Äôm doing cross country in the fall and thought I needed a watch to track my progress but this app is free and works just as great!! It‚Äôll tell me when i‚Äôve ran a mile and tells me my total time and average pace. You can also add goals for your runs, join challenges, and listen to a coach for motivation! Highly recommend if you are looking for something simple but don‚Äôt want to spend a lot on a watch.If you are just getting into running, whatever your fitness level, this app really helps! They have guided coaching, programs for various running goals, reminders and community as well, online or irl. They have various metrics like distance, avg pace, time, and can do heart rate, splits (pace per mile), maps, elevation. The only two issues that I have is I wish it synced with other apps better and that it showed cadence. 

I love this app and will keep using it!I‚Äôve used this app since it required a transponder in my sneaker and worked with my iPod. It was beautifully designed then and is equally lovely now. Clean, smart, straightforward. Love the coaching functionality, the workout options, and the training plans you can create for future races or goals. It keeps me in my running shoes and committed to the idea that doing something is always better than doing nothing.I love NRC app!!! It motivates me to keep running each week, I am able to look back at all the data of old runs, months of progress, and to goals I would like to reach in the future. Other runners and I encourage one another by screen shooting the GPS tracking of our runs and many of my friends have started using it as well!!!

This app has gotten progressively less reliable. Currently it just hangs at the start menu and the watch has to be powered down and restarted to regain control and start a run. It showed a random selection of recent runs in the history on the watch, like one from Sunday and one from Thursday, but Tuesday is missing. This application is not worth the time to download.
I saw a Nike reply to another review that pointed out how badly their app performs and there reply was the app is as fresh as a new pair of kicks, which doesn‚Äôt say much for their shoes. How hard is it to do what the other running apps seem to do without issue, track runs, start reliably, synchronized with other devices, not lose runs when you finish the run?? Their ‚Äúgreat‚Äù social aspects of their app are a joke, the entire top third of leaderboards appear to be falsified runs at least they have limited the fake runs to 50 km per day...I want to like this app because of the coaching feature, but the integration with the Apple Watch is incredibly unreliable. After one run that had been tracking just fine, when I tapped the screen to end my run it suddenly doubled my mileage. Suddenly my slow recovery run said I ran 4:30 minute miles, which was flattering but totally inaccurate. After a different run the watch app crashed after I paused the run but before I could press stop (the app frequently seems to have trouble with this). On this occasion it failed to record my run in my running history at all. Somehow it showed on the watch QuickStart list, but it didn‚Äôt show in my run history on the watch or in the app. If it wasn‚Äôt for coaching plans, I would have given up on this app. As it stands, at least they have a feature where you can edit and/or manually add runs so you can fix all the problems caused when the app messes up.The App lost all my history for 1-1/2 months because it doesn‚Äôt have a mechanism to save it if the sync is pending with Apple Watch. I noticed the sync was pending for the last month and a half and I thought the logical conclusion would be to update the App and therein lies the biggest mistake ever. Once updated all the pending syncs were GONE and when I called the company hoping to get them restored, they told me I should have called them before updating and had I sent screen shots of the runs they could have recovered them. WHO KNEW?? Was there any kind of announcement or could they have sent an email to their App subscribers? I‚Äôm a marathon runner and I depend  on that app for pace and split information. All the information about my running pace, routes, mileage on my shoes, etc. is gone and can‚Äôt be recovered. I‚Äôm so upset I‚Äôm now looking for a more reliable app for running. What app company doesn‚Äôt keep history? I am mortified!!The latest patch broke many things. The mileage on your challenges now double for a single run. If you contact support they can fix it for history, but then it come right back after a few runs. If they make a fix to a run it also unpairs your iwatch from your phone every time. Achievements have been moved down to the very bottom of the screen and makes them unimportant now. In personal records, the date stamp field has been overwritten by the duration field. Duration is already listed though so now you have 2 fields listed on the personal record tab that are duplicative and you cant see when you achieved your new personal record. This must be tough for nrc to fix as its been a month that it has been broken. This shows nrc is out of touch with the app users. As the motivational components of the app are now broken or made an after thought. This app is not for people that run daily anymore.If you like to use your Apple Watch for long runs, don‚Äôt expect NRC to actually work for you. Runs shorter than 8 miles sync from the watch to the phone app easily, but long runs that are important for training purposes? Forget it. I ran 20 MILES yesterday, and the moment I hit ‚Äòdone‚Äô on my watch, the data was gone. Poof. Vanished from my watch like it had NEVER HAPPENED.

Not only did the run disappear from my history, the only proof I have that it happened is from the calories/exercise minutes showing up in my Apple Activity tab. NRC says they have no record of any run. I tried restarting my phone and watch: nothing. Repairing? NOTHING. This is ridiculous and ruins the experience of this app.

Stick to the built in Apple Watch exercise recorder, at least that thing knows how to sync basic data.I‚Äôve used this app for almost a year and had some good times on it. Sure, there were some annoying this (why do I have to manually post each run to my feed, and why does it auto save my pictures to my camera roll), but nothing I couldn‚Äôt live with. About a month ago it started mistracking my distance, it would count a mile at .70! Ridiculous. I would have to delete and re-add, and it would work correctly for a run or two. Even that stopped working and now it‚Äôs just a complete trash app that fails at doing the one thing it was supposed to do. I know it‚Äôs not a phone issue - I‚Äôve used multiple phones!

I‚Äôve reached out to Nike on Twitter multiple times about this issue and they even went as far as to send me an initial email, but have since left me alone.

I was hesitant to leave the app and my run history, but I‚Äôm done. Later NRC!I am ticked my running friends use this app to track our runs. The guided runs are good, but every time over the last 2 years i‚Äôve used the coaches runs it disappoints. Literally click start from the run scheduled for the day, complete it and it doesn‚Äôt record the run. it shows in my history, but doesn‚Äôt associat with my plan. When I had my iPhone 6+ thought it was because I had an old phone, the same on my 10. Yes, you can edit a run to add it to your plan but then that run won‚Äôt show on any leaderboards or challenges, because the edit feature allows you to change times and distances too. I use the app to stay connected with distant friends and want ALL my runs to show up. I wish my cheap friends would let us use a paid app that actually works and is supported.A few years back I got a TomTom watch and primarily use that when I run outdoors, and it's set up to feed my data to Nike+ Run. I still prefer the app for indoors (track and treadmill), and I like the coached speed workouts. However, a few weeks ago I tried to use the app but it no longer knew my account credentials. I've tried requesting the password reset, but it doesn't work - neither by app or in a web browser. Nike, why hast thou abandoned me? I had at least 8 years of data stored with you and now it's gone! 

Other issues I've had lately: it's really convoluted to get to run history, and I couldn't figure out how to get music to play in coached workouts (except when I was at the Y on WiFi). 

Old review:
The Nike+ app simplified my process of keeping track of runs, and I'm grateful for that. I was inordinately excited when it rolled over to 1000 km cumulative. I like the progress reports during a run, although I wish there were more customization options. 

One annoying bug: sometimes it piles all the mile markets in one spot, even though the route is accurate and the splits reasonably so. If the GPS is able to keep track of those two aspects, why aren't the mile markers showing up properly? Weird.The latest upgrade made this unusable. Indoor run pace is way off, and that‚Äôs the majority of my daily runs. Integration with Apple Music doesn‚Äôt allow to shuffle a mix. I‚Äôm going to give up 8 years of history with the app for something that works better. downloaded on my iPhone 5S, so the app couldn't locate any of my running playlists or find any of my music that the old version had no issues streaming from iTunes Match/Cloud. 

I don't like having to toggle the screen to control my music. I frequently skip songs or listen to the same one over again... Toggling is a hassle during a run. 

Press and hold to start/stop is a useless upgrade. Swiping to end a run was not particularly difficult. I don't see any enhancements because of this new ""feature"". If it's not broke, don't ""fix"" it.So I‚Äôm in class right? Taking my final exam for my calculus class when suddenly at full volume my phone yells ‚Äúbeginning workout‚Äù from my pocket and blasts ‚ÄúMy Ni***‚Äù. I did not touch my phone and your app was closed from background yet it started a workout randomly in the middle of class playing music from a playlist I haven‚Äôt listened to in years... That is the story of how your stupid app got me detention during finals week and a 60% on my math final because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to finish it after my phone went off. Thanks a lot Nike for creating the most broken and inaccurate running app around. I‚Äôll stick to the old fashioned timer from now on thank you very much. Oh and if you guys wanna pay my tuition that‚Äôd be great because now I‚Äôm not getting a scholarship with a D in calculus.In the nicest way I can possibly say this, please just stop updating. Since the last update, the app can no longer track my runs properly- it somehow manages to stop tracking me about halfway through my run and then seems to just guesstimate my total distance and pace the rest of the way. At the end, on my summary, I‚Äôm left with a map of half my run and totally unreliable stats. NOTHING has changed with my phone, mobile carrier, cell reception in my area. 

Lastly, is there some place where I can see my history of PR times (best 5k, best 10K, etc...)? Before the ‚ÄúUpdate We Don‚Äôt Speak Of‚Äù a year ago, I was able to at least scroll back through my activity log and see previous best times so I could see my progress. Well, that‚Äôs gone, so thanks for taking away one of my motivations.I have been loyal to the Nike Run app for close to a decade. I love that it has all of my runs stored and how easy it is to set up a Challenge with friends. Unfortunately, though, there is some kind of bug in the latest updates that makes it entirely impossible to track a run! Which is the whole point! I am repeatedly asked to allow the app to access health data on my phone. Despite repeatedly allowing these permissions (and even deleting and re-downloading the app multiple times), it still won‚Äôt let me run. I‚Äôm so bummed to start looking out for another app after so much history and so many years. But if I can‚Äôt click ‚Äúrun‚Äù and head out without being bogged down in errors, then this is no longer the app for me.Have logged over 10,000 miles with this app and have watched it degrade update after update. Glitchy and constantly crashes showing a twirling Nike logo or a yellow dot when the app fails. Can take 10 tries or more to end a run when it does work. Found an app called HealthFit that will take my running history and load it into apps like Strava that shockingly actually work. Left poor reviews and complaints and even received customer service surveys for the non existent follow up I never received from customer service. Nike do you even read your reviews. Review after review outlining the same problem. Way to fail your long time customers Nike. I am one of many that are now done with you.I bought the Apple 5 Nike plus watch specifically for the NRC app and running experience. I‚Äôve been patient with the numerous glitches (gps issue  , crashes etc.) but now I can‚Äôt see my running data on my phone (on the nrc app or the apple health app!  The NRC phone app keeps asking me to set up a new account even though it recognizes my email and asked me to reset my password. Tacking history & progress (data is the entire point of the app! I work in software and app / website Developement. Nike should be ashamed. 

There is no way this app is 4.5 stars and editors choice. So I have to assume, On top of the terrible software, Nike is falsifying ratings data.

I purchased the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ Edition specifically to use with this app because I loved it so much and wanted to continue using the app on the watch. Long story short, it crashes regularly and doesn‚Äôt log my run properly, if at all! The GPS is accurate for mileage but the integrated maps don‚Äôt show the actual route I took or it‚Äôs really skewed! I have no idea how that‚Äôs even possible. Additionally, it takes me a minimum of 5 tries to pause and stop a run from my watch! This morning I have it one more shot but it took me 45min and 10+ tries to end my run. Not sure why I persisted, but I did. My only assumption is that it works better on newer models of the Apple Watch. I won‚Äôt be using anymore on my watch.

As for using the app on my phone, I love it. Works well, very accurate, and doesn‚Äôt crash. No complaints about the app. Plus I love that it gives me incremental stats and pace and allows me to adjust it to suit my needs. Training plans are good and the other guided runs are fun to use sometimes, but I typically follow other run plans, so I‚Äôm no expert on the guided runs.This app is decent for using outdoors, but it is totally useless for using while running indoors on a treadmill. It takes no account for the runner‚Äôs height, cadence or previous performance history. I‚Äôve been a competitive runner for over 40 years and when using this app on a treadmill the data it provides is as vague as if I threw a dart at a chart while being blindfolded. It totally guesses at pace and distance being run. Depending on the day the app is bing used, my calculated pace can vary as much as 5 minutes per mile or more and the estimated distance can vary as much as 4 miles or more during a 1 hour run. There‚Äôs a huge difference between the app saying I‚Äôve run 10 miles in one hour at a 6:00 minute per mile pace on one day and then being told I‚Äôve run 6 miles at a 10:00 per mile pace the very next day (when running at the same exact cadence, overall time and approximate effort level). If you‚Äôre going to use this app while running on a treadmill, you‚Äôre better off just wearing a good old fashioned stopwatch.As others have noted in their critical reviews, this Apple Watch app is useless and irksome. I made the mistake of waiting for the Nike + version S2 watch and have yet to accomplish a run via the watch since iOS 11 and watchOS 4. Even tried resetting watch to factory, reinstalling all apps and no dice. Best to stay away from this one until Nike and Apple sort out how to make their flagship app for this ‚Äúspecial‚Äù version watch work. Worried for those waiting on the Nike+ S3 version as I suspect they will have similar issues given the sorted history of this buggy app. As it stands, I‚Äôve abandoned it and am sticking with the iOS app on my iPhone. Frustrating, but I see no other option at this point as I‚Äôm firmly in the Nike ecosystem. Sad to see as it was one of my favorite apps back from the days of using the foot sensor and my old iPod classic. Cmon Nike, please get the bugs sorted out!!!I‚Äôm surprised to see so many high ratings for this app. I used this app religiously for every run before I got my Apple Watch. It worked great. Since using the Apple Watch for a year now it started off ok. Some bugs here and there but the main things, gps, split time tracking all worked fine. As I continue to use this app and get later and later releases, it works less and less. It‚Äôs now to the point I have to manually input most runs. If I run over 10 miles it‚Äôs almost guaranteed. Awful. The app now takes forever to open (if it doesn‚Äôt crash beforehand) and then when my run is finished the pause and stop buttons might not work, causing the app to crash and me losing multiple mile runs. It‚Äôs become terrible. And I have a lot of history with this app so it‚Äôs very disappointing. I hope Nike figures things out quickly...I have over 10 years of data on the NRC app, and never before had I experienced this issue over and over again on consecutive runs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the same issue occurs: you compete a run, hit pause before you officially stop or end your workout and BOOM! Everything disappears, there is run data to sync or history of your run and the Apple rings just overtake the iwatch screen. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP! Otherwise, there is truly no motivation to have this app or to use it. All my data can be created and stored with any other device or app, which is important when you are seeing to meet and exceed challenges and goals you have for yourself. THANKS!I had Garmin watches for years; I started using an Apple Watch for running in August & love it except for this issue! 

My nagging commitment to this Nike Run ecosystem is that I have nearly 12,500 miles logged on it (I started running in 2010 using an iPod Touch, the Nike App & the dongle on my shoe laces!!) & because it‚Äôs a closed system so I can‚Äôt just export all of my run history & my aggregate total of miles into something that works better!

I export to Strava using Run Gap. In my opinion there‚Äôs a serious design flaw in their App. It should be default save EVERY run. If you accidentally saved a run you didn‚Äôt want, you go in and delete it! Grrrrrrr!!! I‚Äôve lost a ridiculous number or runs because of this! Unacceptable! You can do better Nike!Let me start off saying I honestly love this app, the way it records your runs and the interface is really nice. All that said I started a coaching plan to run a marathon next year, I have successfully done 1 week worth of running that shows up in my run history but the coach will not give me credit for completing. I made sure to start the runs through the coach and it does everything as it should while I‚Äôm running but afterwards it will not check it off my list. I do love the app for the running tracking aspect but now I will have to try to start over and see if it will give me credit this time, unless support can contact me with a fix. So 5 star tracking app, but as of right now 1 star coaching app.First of all, I‚Äôm a Nike fan. I own running shoes, clothing, etc. But the only aspect of the Nike Run app that has been keeping me engaged is the run history. That‚Äôs it. I have the latest Apple Watch and the ‚Äòstart run‚Äô process is frustrating every time - it takes almost a minute to ready itself. Has been this way on and off for years, no matter what version of the Apple Watch I have had. I finally realized this factor is costing me time at the beginning of my runs. Additionally, the app contributes to crashing the watch during runs. It has so much potential but I can‚Äôt wait any longer for the app experience to improve - I‚Äôm officially moving on today.I‚Äôve been using this app for ten years and have my entire run history documented so giving it up is hard. However, the app just doesn‚Äôt work. Over time it gets worse and the glitches increase. 

Half my runs last month mysteriously disappeared and I can‚Äôt find any record of them. The details from the runs also get distorted. This morning I ran 8 miles in 53:58 which is roughly a 6:45 mile pace. Shortly after the run ended the app changed the distance to 4 miles in 53:58 and lists my pace at 13:29 per mile which is ridiculous. If I look at the splits, all 8 miles are logged so it makes no sense. Little glitches like this happen all the time and make this app impossible to use as a reliable tool for training.I‚Äôm training for a 10k, and while I‚Äôm pretty new to running, I consistently run a 10 min mile or better. At week 4 of the plan and having completed two benchmark runs, the app still insists that I should shoot for paces like 12:44/mi for a long run and 11:44/mi for a tempo run.

It‚Äôs really frustrating because I got this app to learn how to push myself and pace myself, but these pace targets aren‚Äôt even close to my ability (or my history of runs on the app.) Does anyone know how to fix this?? Has anyone experienced the same problem? 

It‚Äôs really ruined the app for me. I use a wearable to track my runs and upload them to strava, the only reason I wanted this app was for the My Coach feature and the running plans.I used to really enjoy this app and the experience of building up mileage, however it‚Äôs now more frustrating than usable. It no longer syncs with the Apple Watch! You can start a run on either the watch or your iPhone, but they will not sync on both devices until the run is done. So you either use the watch and have the announcements made aloud, or you use the iPhone and have no way of visually checking pace and distance.  Tech help just says the same ‚Äúreset the device‚Äù and ‚Äúre-install the app‚Äù which does not work! So if you‚Äôre just starting out, find another app that should have a more reliable history of functioning as advertised....I‚Äôve used this app since it was introduced, and really used to love it. The distance and route are reported accurately and it‚Äôs nice to have the history of your runs. But with each update they make it harder to use and take away settings that were helpful before. Now you can‚Äôt even change the display screen to show the distance in miles, only meters. I‚Äôve reset the setting to make sure it‚Äôs set to ‚ÄòImperial‚Äô but to no avail. The audible voice reports the distance in miles as you run and the results at the end are shown in miles.  How does this makes sense?  I‚Äôve finally had enough and am deleting this app and changing to another.Using the marathon training program and when I‚Äôm scheduled for a NTC work out, the info doesn‚Äôt sync to the Run App as complete. Also, 2-3 runs did not sync yet they are in my history. Very discouraging since I‚Äôd like to see my weekly program show as complete and it‚Äôs not happening. 

Secondly, the music controls are awful. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a fault of Nike or Apple. I set my music to play from iTunes through the Nike app, lock the screen, place my phone in my waistband and the music starts and stops, starts and stops. Completely distracting and takes me out of my concentration. I‚Äôve had to just turn off the music completely.",0,"Great on the iPhone / Terrible on the Apple WatchTerrible for using indoorsHorrible, laggy and prone to crashDisappointmentJuly 2021 Updates = Syncing IssuesDropping Runs after I‚Äôve Finished!!

1. The inability to use a run in my history towards my training plan. For instance, I did a long run today that for some reason didn‚Äôt sync to my training plan, so according to the plan, I didn‚Äôt do the run despite it being in my history. If I add the run manually to the plan it will show up in my history twice and my monthly milage will be inaccurate, plus the frustration of knowing I ran but seeing this week as an incomplete in the training plan. There should be in option to add an existing run to the plan for that corresponding day. 

2. This isn‚Äôt as big of a deal, but the social media aspect of this app is far from perfect. With Run keeper your friends are automatically able to see your runs with all of the attached data-splits, milage, pace etc. Nike went for more of a social media approach where you can take a pic and make a post with your milage, pace, and avg time but anything else would have to be added in the caption. Not a huge deal but I vastly prefer Run Keeper where my friends can see all the details of my run automatically and there are no adds blocking up the feedI used to be a casual Nike+ app user, before the first Apple Watch was released. For the past few months, however, I‚Äôve been marathon training, using the My Coach feature on the iPhone app and wearing my Watch on my runs to track heartbeat and more accurate calorie burn. I‚Äôm disappointed the My Coach feature isn‚Äôt available on my Watch (Series 3 GPS), nor does my running activity (history) show up in the NRC app on my Watch. I‚Äôm also disappointed that the NRC complication on my Watch is useless because the Last Run & Next Run information doesn‚Äôt sync from the iPhone app. Please add My Coach functionality to the Watch app as soon as possible.

The app crashes / doesn‚Äôt track runs 100% of the time. I‚Äôve had to restart Audio Guided Runs from My Coach multiple times because it crashes a few minutes into my run. I‚Äôm paranoid now, so I reboot both my iPhone and my Watch before each run, and go through the Watch setup in the NRC iPhone app each time as well. It‚Äôs a huge time-waster.

Thanks for your attention to these issues. I look forward to the next update when they‚Äôre all fixed!I have been using NRC for four years, since Nike Plus days. I love the design, the feedback and achievements, the community features, integration with music. And unlike most other apps, it never bugs you about upgrading to premium version.
But after 500 runs, it reached a point of being unusable. The startup takes several minutes on an iPhone SE. Countdown to run stops at ‚Äú1‚Äù and stays there for up to a minute before tracking starts. Many updates bring bugs like music muting when the run starts, forcing restart of the Music app, etc. The web site version was always very slow, but now the community features like heat maps seem to be disappearing.
I have moved my runs to Strava (exporting runs from Nike is a challenge in itself!), which is extremely responsive in comparison. Going back through run history is a snap, and tracking starts instantly. Yes, the feedback is missing, unless you pay an annual fee. But at least I start each run in a better mood.I love so many things about this app but there are a few very annoying things that prevent me from giving it a higher rating. For one, I use the guided runs A LOT and none of them sync to my history on the app when I run indoors or out and I have to go in and add them each time. If Nike could fix this so the guided runs would sync or count at all I would give it a better rating. Also, it has no way of tracking indoor runs even if you put that you used a treadmill or running indoors and that messes with my pace and averages and I have to use another means to record my pace and mileage. Finally as I‚Äôm using the app to record a run, sometimes it will sync to my watch and sometimes not. Or if I use my the app on my apple watch instead it won‚Äôt sync to the app on my phone. Some annoying bug fixes and it would be so much user friendly and helpful.I‚Äôve been using Nike+ for 10 years. I‚Äôve always been loyal even as other apps started to grow in popularity and have more social features. I‚Äôm struggling to stay loyal. 

I used coach for half marathon training 3-4 years ago and crushed it. This year I‚Äôm using coach and it‚Äôs definitely not the same program. It barely has me running 10 miles for a long run before the race. Also, if I don‚Äôt log into app and assign a run to a run in the plan, that week, it doesn‚Äôt log it towards my plan. Last week, I did a 10k on Sunday and didn‚Äôt log in and now it doesn‚Äôt count that run in my training plan even though it‚Äôs sitting there in my run history.  I also can‚Äôt move a planned long run into a different week (want on Sunday, not Tuesday). 

I like some of the social features, guided runs and whatnot but missing some of the things I used to love. Not the ‚Äúcoach‚Äù it used to be.I‚Äôve been using the NRC app for a few years, including with my Apple Watch. Recently I started having trouble being able to start a run from my watch...it kept telling me I needed to go to the app on my phone and update settings. When I went to the app on my phone the settings were correct. Got stuck in a vicious cycle. 

I logged out of my app, out of my watch, reset it, deleted the app, etc. and it deleted my history except for the last few weeks worth of data. Not that I‚Äôm a huge runner, but a few years worth of data was cool to have.

I also have the Nike Training Club app, so I checked those settings out in case that impacted it somehow. That fixed the issue of being able to use my watch to start a run for a short time period. But then my watch wouldn‚Äôt sync my runs to the app on my phone. Now I‚Äôm back to having problems starting a run on my watch. I get the ‚Äústart‚Äù button but I press it and nothing happens even if I try to say what distance or time I want to go. 

I would really love to be able to recover my history, and figure out why my watch & phone don‚Äôt seem to work together to sync. Reached out to customer support and got nothing.

As much as I want to love your app, it‚Äôs not reliable. What gives?I really like this app as I am a new-again runner, trying to get in shape again after having kids. I really like the coaches runs and things like that, but the ‚Äòmy coach‚Äô item in the app isn‚Äôt offered in the watch and the runs that are on my coach either aren‚Äôt accessible on the watch or are hard to find. I really wish the watch mirrored the app more. Also I am reading that people are loosing run history that the watch doesn‚Äôt sync to the app. I really hope that doesn‚Äôt happen to me, so far it has not. I‚Äôd be willing to change my rating if improvements are made that allow you to use the app a bit more interchangeably between the app and the watch.I could care less about achievement features and gamification of my running experience if the Get More Fit Plan can't even keep up with my records. The runs are showing in my history, but about once a week, a run or two will somehow lose sync with the run in my plan. This affects the My Coach feature's perception of my progress. Also, I would like the treadmill option to return as a location for where I run. I understand that you probably removed it in favor of your new infographics for showing a mapped path of where users run, but I'd rather have the option to log a run on a treadmill than see some flashy geolocation infographic that gives me very little insight into my runs.I‚Äôve used all the major running apps and have logged many runs.

The NRC app is good but the user experience could be greatly improved.

There are some major sync bugs that take away entire runs from you.  These don‚Äôt happen often but when they do - you loose the entire history of your run.  This has not happened with any other running app.

The community challenges are a joke.  There‚Äôs someone who logged 270,000 miles for the January 2020 challenge.  You couldn‚Äôt even drive that many miles.  What‚Äôs the point of a global challenge if you cannot compete against real users and real user data.

Lastly, the features do not consistently activate.  The announcer doesn‚Äôt always announce when I‚Äôve finished a run.  This is annoying when you are trying to run a set distance or pace.  

In spite of all this, I am a loyal.  And I think the core features are great.  But Nike - fix these issues!  Just do it!I‚Äôve been using this app for awhile and have really enjoyed it until about a week ago. All of a sudden my runs and NTC workouts are not saving on my training plan so my plan keeps adapting because it doesn‚Äôt recognize that I‚Äôm doing the plan as it‚Äôs lined out. I‚Äôve even tried using the ‚ÄúAdd Run‚Äù to manually enter my runs and it still is not applying them to my training plan....but all my workouts show in my History!  It‚Äôs very frustrating and takes away a lot of the motivation and competition as the miles aren‚Äôt applying to the challenges I‚Äôve entered.",0,"Almost a great appNeeds better Watch integrationGreat app for casual runs, problematic for long-time useWish it would be consistentRollercoaster of ups and downsCan‚Äôt depend on appThings that would be useful don‚Äôt sync between watch and phoneUseless new features, degraded reliabilityGood app but multiple noticeable issuesRuns aren‚Äôt syncing",SiennanaJasonRapoportMr. Cogitomamber24Proudkjb8oh2bLindCaseyTownsendJohnny Depthsldrimer74,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,2,0,0,1,2,2,0,10,0,1732,has_narrative,75

However, one of the pain points for me is when adding a manual run during workouts where I don‚Äôt have my phone on me (I do orangetheory and other classes sometimes) the miles I log on the treadmill during those workouts are showing in my history, but not counting towards my challenges. I have run over 6 miles in the treadmill in these orangetheory workouts in the last 3 days and are not getting credit for it in my challenges. I think this functionality should be fixed.I started using this app in 2008 when it was the Nike+ app. Back then, you were able to go to the full site on your computer and create custom training programs, review your annual history, etc.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying a membership fee to use IoT technology that can give me better insight. The starburst also disappeared, so I can no longer look at my run to see my interval pace. That was very critical in my training programs.

I like exploring the different guided runs very much, but today‚Äôs run with Lopez (Part One) was different. I really didn‚Äôt like it because the story distracted me from my run. I wasn‚Äôt being ‚Äúguided‚Äù on my run, I was being told a story to music. An inspiring story, but I‚Äôd rather listen to it as a podcast while driving. I use this app to push my running, not for inspirational audio storytelling. That said, I think what made it worse was Coach Bennett. The way coach Bennett literally just repeats everything the guest says and then finishes up by adding some obvious color commentary is just annoying as all hell. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I just roll my eyes and want to rip my earbuds out when he starts talking. Coach, quit the talk show host bit and just coach. Talk about what you know. Running. All you‚Äôre doing is just doubling the length of the transcript with your fluff and it makes me want to not click on any content that has Coach Bennett‚Äôs name on it.I‚Äôve been using this app for years and I have a love-hate relationship with it. Love the running coach, training programs, challenge creations, Headspace audios and the letterboards + awards. All that being said sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt work for me at all. If I start a run on my phone it won‚Äôt sync to my Apple Watch in real time or ever. If I start a run on my watch it won‚Äôt sync after the fact on my phone and add to my run history (but it does show up on the Activity app that comes with iPhone). On the watch it takes forever to end the workout no matter how many times I press stop. Once my current training program disappeared completely and took me back to the ‚Äúcreate a program‚Äù page. Also if I manually add a run it doesn‚Äôt seem to update in any challenges I‚Äôm enrolled in. Sometimes if I‚Äôm Running with Headspace the music in the background is louder than Coach Bennet and Andy so I can‚Äôt hear them unless I pause the music. So I wish these issues were fixed so I can enjoy the app again.I love that this app keeps me accountable, motivates me and gives me a schedule tailored to my progress. I was initially very impressed with the audio feedback with the benchmark runs, and I looked forward to that feedback when doing sprint reps. It was disappointed when I began my first rep sprint but there was no feedback. I was so confused on how to use the lap timer. After running the first lap and walking during the ‚Äúrest‚Äù time I thought to myself, ‚Äúhold on what is this timer icon?‚Äù I tapped it and then realized that this button was what counted my reps. So long story short my average time for this run was all off and ultimately defeated the purpose of the app tailoring my runs to my progress. This aspect of the UI could be improved to either describe the expectation of how to use the timer icon for reps OR even better add audio feedback to the progress so you know when to run and rest instead of having to hold and look at your phone.Let me begin with, I love the features of this app. I am training for my second half marathon and enjoy the diversity of the features. For example, some runs I enjoy the guided whereas others I might just let the music play. The challenges are motivating along with the achievements, as well. 

The one area that I am really seeing the biggest problem with is the coaching. I started a training plan and all was well for a week or two. However, as I would press start and hear the halfway point warnings of my run, I would then find that it didn‚Äôt register to my coaching plan. I could see the run in the history but not in my coaching plan. This part is very frustrating as I am trying to track my progress throughout the training and have to search through the history in order to see how I am really doing. 

I began using Another app to track my progress, however I still use and love the features of NRC.I was using a different, older running app for so long because I didn‚Äôt want to leave my stats and records. But after a break from serious running, I decided to switch to Nike Run Club! I love the way the app visualizes the results of an individual run and as whole the app is much more than just a run tracking app. 

One thing I‚Äôm really missing though is a way to track weekly and monthly mileage. Weekly mileage is so important for measuring progress and preventing injury when training for a race. I found a way to see my weekly mileage on the leaderboard, but it only tracks back 1 week, doesn‚Äôt tell me everything I want to know, and isn‚Äôt a good experience to quickly compare weeks or months. 

So if there‚Äôs any product people reading this, please build out the run history section to track mileage/stats over time!I have been using the NRC app for years and it works great for tracking you runs and history. However there haven‚Äôt been many updates to some of the features in a while. For example, when sharing your runs the ‚Äústickers‚Äù are the same old one. You can only use the same ‚Äúpre lives‚Äù ‚Äúwe running today‚Äù or little fluffy cloud person stretching so many times. Add a new sticker pack. Also it would be nice to see more info about your friends runs. Right now all you can see is their mileage on the leaderboard. It would be nice to see more stats like pace, average run distance and what not. Freshen up. Nice guided runs being added but that‚Äôs not enough for a five star rating.The Nike+ Run app is an app that could use some self awareness within its development to cater to the user a bit more. The guided runs are great for initially starting any distance training, but the guided runs provide distance increment updates that cannot be found outside of the coach repeating the same story, that becomes tired. This alone makes me not want to use the app because these repeated stories become distractions, especially when I only want to hear the distance increment(I.e. quarter mile updates within any times run). Lastly, the distance tracking varies greatly and makes tracking progress very difficult if on different days, the same starting line ends with a wide array of finish lines.The music doesn‚Äôt always sync well. If you accidentally close the app in the middle of a guided run, it won‚Äôt pick up the narrative again. I also hope for better Apple Watch compatibility, such as seeing your active run on your watch.
Otherwise, this app has kept me running to a solid year. Coach Bennett is rad and I can honestly say that I really disliked running and now I feel off when I don‚Äôt. I love the guest speakers on the run, the RUN FOR LIFE is my favorite.
I am also hoping for a filter/sorting options for the guided runs. When I only have time to run 30min, it would be nice to see what my options are quickly instead of scrolling through.
Anyway, great app if you are looking to get running and staying motivated!Nike run club is generally a great app - easy to use, helpful to track running history, and allows friendly competitions with friends and others to motivate yourself to run.

Two flaws around the Challenges need to be addressed. First being the need to prevent a significant number of people from deceiving the app into thinking they‚Äôve run 150 miles a day for 30 days straight. It‚Äôs frustrating to see and is obviously not the case.

Also, users should be notified that it‚Äôs the first of the month and they should join it right away to begin working to the goal. Consider ‚Äúlocking‚Äù it after some number of days to encourage that, or allow auto-enrollment based on a user setting.This app convinced me I could run and made me feel that it was okay to start wherever I was at. I‚Äôm super grateful for the motivation and the tracking and everything. Training for a 5k right now and made a plan on NRC, and my only gripe is that sometimes you can‚Äôt edit run data and include it in your plan log or whatever you want to call it. So there are some weeks that I know I did the runs in my plan but they didn‚Äôt show up in the my coach history. The other thing is that the plan incorporates workouts from Nike training club, but when I do those it doesn‚Äôt sync into my plan. For people who like to keep their data it kinda stinks but at least I actually did the real work!I‚Äôve been using Nike since I started running in 2009 so it has all my history and I like that it connects to things like Garmin as I‚Äôve gotten more savvy with my gear but don‚Äôt want to lose my run history.

I used the My Coach Training app for a Half last fall and liked it but wish it would let me put in a time goal when creating my plan.  That‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt use it for my last race and won‚Äôt for my next race.  It seemed to be giving me paces based on my run history not what I am trying to achieve as my goal time.

Please make this update!!!I use this app daily during my running workouts. As previous user reported, after the recent update the app is sluggish. It lags in responding on the watch. Opening the app takes forever. Runs are not recorded when I lower my wrist during the countdown. Running history on the watch is behind. Workouts achievements on the phone app does not reflect true workouts. The only reason I have the watch Nike edition is because I love running and needed a tracker. Now I‚Äôm too scared to upgrade to watch 3. Please fix this immediately.I love the app. It works really well for mapping my runs and tracking my history. The extra features also look cool and plan on using them.

However, at the end of each run, you get some athlete that says something along the line of  ‚Äúgreat job!‚Äù That‚Äôs all fine... except when it‚Äôs Kevin Hart saying it to you. The last thing I want to hear after running is Kevin Hart screaming at me in his doofy annoying voice like it‚Äôs one of his stand up routines.

     Fast forward about a year and I was getting winded going up flights of stairs. I knew I had to change my way of life so I started going on runs by myself but, I wasn‚Äôt able to pace myself. I‚Äôd push myself too hard and becomes wiped out by the .25 mile mark. 
     That‚Äôs when I found this app. The guided runs are actually super motivational and keep you pushing yourself but not to the point where you‚Äôre going to be exhausted halfway through. The online coaches are in your ear, right there beside you every step of the way. And after your run there are even more tips that you can read up on such as ‚ÄúHow to keep a positive mindset during a run‚Äù or even ‚ÄúHow to prepare for All-weather running‚Äù Because of this app I‚Äôm not only getting back into shape, I‚Äôm also beginning to actually ENJOY running again. 

      The only con about this app is that when you‚Äôre on a guided run I‚Äôve had to keep resuming my music after the coach is done talking. No that annoying when you‚Äôre doing a straight 2 mile run but it gets pretty old when you do a ‚ÄúSpeed Run‚Äù or interval sprints. 

9/10 would HIGHLY recommendThis is a great app and motivates me to maintain a running routine. There is a Guided Run for every mood and time of day. However, I wish there was a way to filter the Guided Runs based on distance, time, type of run (recovery, speed, interval, tempo, tabata) etc. instead of scrolling through all the runs alphabetically in order to find what I need.
Also, I would like if the app logged and showed the history of my personal best running times for the provided distances (1k, 1mile, 5k, etc.) instead of only showing the best time. It would be nice to be able to track progress.
Lastly, I would like for there to be a way to export all of my run data into a consolidated spreadsheet or print document. Namely, I‚Äôd like to be able to easily export all of my Run Notes, as those notes are often similar to journal entries and are nice remembrances of what was going on in my life around the time of the run.Appreciate and noticed app working smoother for me since most recent update. I‚Äôm most happy to be able to view maps again of older runs in the history. Tbh I have used this since 2010 and I still wonder if I‚Äôll ever get to the volt level! I am still unhappy they removed race distances/marathon guided plan, instead it‚Äôs a pdf download?! Would rate 5 stars if training plans ever come back. I love all the variety of coach guided workout runs like speed/hill/fartlek whatever, I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to put them together on my own. It‚Äôs definitely not a perfect app but overall I‚Äôm still happy enough to have stayed Nike+ for all these years.This is a great app. I just use the ‚Äòfree run‚Äô mode when running, and find the mile splits, average pace, heart rate and current pace to be very accurate when used with the Apple Watch.

Occasionally will not update recently finished runs on the watch -  completed runs are sometimes not added to the ‚Äòhistory‚Äô section on the watch, but appear on the phone.

The app seems to glitch when attempting to start a run, guessing this is because the watch is disconnecting from the iPhone when getting out of the Bluetooth range, but this is very annoying when trying to start a run but having to wait for the ‚Äòcountdown‚Äô to start a run with the app.Accuracy and ease of use has certainly improved over the last few years, and maybe I‚Äôm just whining, but I‚Äôd still like to be able to download my run history to manipulate it in Excel. My wife and I run separately, but walk together, and we track all that mileage.  What i can‚Äôt do is filter out walks to see just my run data and averages. So, a few months ago, i started tracking walks with the Underarmor app instead, and I deleted the walks during that timeframe. Now i only use Nike for runs. If I were a more disciplined runner, this may not be an issue, but I actually use my running history (or lack thereof) to motivate myself to run more often, and harder.It does almost everything I want it to do. But after using this app for a while, I wanted to see how my pace was improving (or not) over time. Sure I can scroll through the history and see the average pace for each run, but as the app keeps updating its cumulative average pace over all the runs in the history, I would like to see how that average has changed over time. That could help determine if the particular type of training I was doing gave much or little speed improvement. 
Aside from that, I have used most of the features and I think overall it is a great app.I use Nike Run to track my distance and speed. Although I run for myself and not for an app, it's easy to forget with the community and history you can build on this app. For that reason I am annoyed that on an upgrade earlier this year, the app lost all my history. I also lost a particularly good time when the app tracked my time but not my distance, resulting in a whopping 29 minute mile instead of low 7s. ALL of these issues can be forgotten and forgiven given the underlying joy of just getting out and having a simple tool to track every aspect of your run. For that reason, I recommend Nike Run heartily!I've tried a couple other running apps, and this one is definitely the easiest to navigate and works just as well if not better! I've used it for almost 18 months now.

Some things that could be better..
It frequently crashed and took a minutes to load things. It may have been fixed now, but that sucked. It also requires a LOT of miles to advance in your ""level""! Maybe when I'm 60 I'll get to the purple level.

Some things I love about the app..
I love that you can track how many miles you run in a certain pair of shoes. That helps with joint health, and I would probably be wearing the same torn up shoes if I didn't know how many miles I really ran in them. I also love the history it tracks and the averages it gives me so I can see if I'm getting better. And I like that I can input runs when I don't have the app/my phone on me or when I run on a treadmill.

Overall, a terrific running app. Great job, Nike.",0,Awesomely MotivationalNeeds ‚ÄúGuided Run‚Äù FiltersDecent run appGreat app with some glitchesCould be betterGood app but needs graphical tracking over timeWhy do you run?Content with It,E.T.

So I bust open old faithful aka the NRC app, decided I‚Äôm gonna start running again for weight loss, and get my running stride back. Also with outside being closed with nothing to do I was not about to go stir crazy and go overboard with the random need to gain baking skills nor become Tik Tok famous. This app took me from being able to barely run to the mailbox to running 2 miles with ease in just 5 weeks with the training program. During your runs you get the coach motivating to keep going. The app also syncs with your Apple Watch. Do yourself a favor stop looking at these reviews and just go ahead and download the app because it works!! KSo today I had 2 different experiences with the App using the Apple Watch 7 Nike Edition. I‚Äôve been using this app off and on since 2016 and I really like it for the most part. However today I was running and paused at the top of the mountain and my watch paused bc I stopped which is normal but then it took it another step and completed the run altogether about 1.69 miles in. So‚Ä¶. I had to start a new run. I ran another 3.5 miles and completed the 5.1 mile loop I wanted to run today. 

Well I wanted to see if I could just edit the length of the 2nd part of the run sun the map image was fine and I wanted to share the run on social media. What I wanted to do was combine the 2 runs  since my watch stopped early on, and make it just 1 total run. But when I edited the run it gave me the pop up of course that the run may not count toward badges since it‚Äôs edit. But then I went to save the run and it wouldn‚Äôt let me save and the the run just vanished from my history altogether.

So now if you look at my history for today you only see the 1.69 miles beginning but not the 3.6 miles second part. My question is where did it go? Snd can I get it back.

Also let‚Äôs say I accidentally delete it instead of saving, I think it would be nice to have a way to undelete if it was an accident. 

That‚Äôs all. 

Just do it‚Ä¶ just fix the app. Do it‚Ä¶ just do it already. 

SwooshLet‚Äôs be honest, this app is the reason I started running, and stick with it - I‚Äôll be a runner for life now. When I started I was extremely unhealthy, could barely jog 50 meters. It was really awful and embarrassing. Slowly but surely, I could do 100 meters, then 500, then 1k, then 5k... and the rest is history. Years ago if you told me I would one day be able to run 5k I would have laughed in your face. Impossible for someone like me. 

What started out as a need to loose weight, turned into just gaining kms, not even caring about my weight anymore. I changed my eating habits and lifestyle to make sure I had the energy to run - I just loved it so much. The benefits came as an afterthought, which is why I was able to stick with it, solely focusing on increasing my kms was the key. 

I‚Äôm almost at 1000kms and I am SO proud of myself. You have no idea. Thinking back to where I started, my achievement is huge. Thank you Nike. 

Despite the random issues people and myself have experienced with the app, I think credit should be given where credit is due. This app changed my life. Please don‚Äôt ever take it away. 

For those curious: I use it on my iPhone 7 only, not my Apple Watch. I just turn the app on, strap it to my arm, and go.I usually don‚Äôt write reviews, so please take a seat on the carpet for story time.  

I don‚Äôt mean to be that annoying workout person, but if you have ever wanted to try to get into running, NRC is the answer.  I have been trying to run a 5k for years, have used all kinds of apps, never completing the 8 week programs and falling off my diet and exercise routine.  So maybe I wasn‚Äôt a runner.  

In April of 2022 I decided to get off my couch and get healthy just to finally prove to myself I could.  In July, as a reward to myself for losing 25lbs (yay!) I was going to join the gym down the street.  Every single time I would walk there, their parking lot was just packed.  Ewww.  So I started focusing on walking a lot and doing garage workouts using Apple Fitness, in turn, my Apple Watch band was just getting disgusting.   I went to order a new band as my new reward, and there it was, looking all sexy on the Apple Store!  The Nike Apple Watch with Nike Run Club.  

I purchased the watch and within three short weeks of Coach Bennett‚Äôs beginner run plan on NRC, I am proud to say I RAN 5k!! 

I get chills when I think about how much I love running now.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèº  Turns out I am a runner after all.Love the new guided runs! I ran a marathon and wanted to make it a goal every year I loved it so much! Life got busy and I fell off the running train nearly completely. A nerve in the ball of my foot also hindered me as I never knew if it would act up during my run or not. I‚Äôm trying to get back into it but it‚Äôs discouraging because I‚Äôve lost my endurance. What used to be an easy 10 or longer is a difficult 3 w walking. I‚Äôm going to try to stay in the game and not listen to that discouraging voice and the Nike Guides Runs are very helpful. They remind me that it‚Äôs not a race and today is a step closer to an easier tomorrow. Soon I will be running my easy 10‚Äôs and have a story to share for those who know this story to well themselves. Get up my friends and let‚Äôs ‚Äújust do it‚Äù together w Nike Guides Runs!I need to know the exact time of day each run has been ran. 
Need fix gps. Will not find location until I've already started running by then it's too late and it won't go back until about a mile into my run.  If I start the app and put it on pause for about 10 seconds it'll finally find the GPS tracking but then It messes up my timing. 
This was the only app I used. 
I used this app to keep a log of all my runs (shoe mileage, notations, photos, etc.). All of which have disappeared. 
The new update will take some getting used to, which is expected, but do not remove the history from the previous versions. 
Please tell me there is some way to retrieve this information.
At least my shoe mileage is back with the new updated. Now, add all my log memos back and I'll be happy.",0,It makes you a better runner!!Just a few things I want to mention.The reason I now run - Thank you NikeCouch to 5k within three weeksGuided runsPlease add time run started like the old old version,Meme780IcemankevinKRosilphotoshoppingmeStylist@404Tacobell993,0,Nike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run ClubNike Run Club,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,6,0,1277,has_narrative,75

I am an overweight 22-year-old female who has packed on weight from depression and anxiety. It got worse last year when my dad passed away. I knew that I had spiraled out of control when I hit the 200‚Äôs so I wanted to do something about it. Long story short this app actually made me think that I could try running as an option. The guided runs are great and motivational even for beginners like me. Despite the other reviews, it synced perfectly with my series 3 Apple watch. So Far I have no complaints. Thank you, Nike!I‚Äôve had the Nike app for many years. I started with the Nike + sport band, then upgraded to the Nike + sport watch GPS and now the Apple Watch. What I appreciate the most is the mapped out runs and the fact that all my mileage history recorded with the old gear is still there. I even had a period with no working watch. I thought my account would be closed due to inactivity, but thankfully everything was still there when I migrated to the Apple Watch. Overall, I must say that the app is great, and I appreciate all the improvements Nike has made over the years. Thanks!The guided runs are a good source for changing up my workouts and the intervals in Party have produced excellent results! It‚Äôs also nice to have my stats easily accessed on my watch or phone!!
  Had a run show on the home face Last run 2.50 but didn‚Äôt go to my history. I then added it and it showed in History and my Leaderboard but not in my 100k challenge. Can you fix this bug?
   I like the new upgrade which gives easy access to week, month, year, and all categories. December 10, 2020.I‚Äôve tried Runtastic, Map My Run  and Runtopia. NRC is the best app there is for runners. The Run Level system integrated in the app encourages you to compete against yourself and do better than the last week. The app also has a bunch of awards which, I admit, can get quite addicting and pushes you to run more. The clear layout of the history tab allows you to go back and monitor your improvements which can also be very motivating. NRC also connects you to a community of runners by doing weekly and monthly app-wide challenges.I like this app because it is easy to use and has a variety of Run types. I'm a late in life runner... 55 yrs old and running for 4 years. I'm not fast at all but I don't feel anything but motivated and celebrated by my nike coaches. I love hearing their synopsis of my run that day or over the past week. I love look at my progress and history over the last 4 years and I love getting achievements and leveling up as I stick with it... even when I don't think I can. I really love the music integration, too!I love the app so far. I can track monthly mileage and set goals.  It also allows for indoor work out plans so you don‚Äôt have to get creative yourself. 

My only 2 drawbacks:

1. The way your run will post to Social Media when you want to brag about your run. It only shows the route and distance. No total time or average pace. That would be cool to show on there as well to be able to give the entire story to your friends regarding your run. 

2.  The way you have to start the run from your phone and are unable to do it from the Apple Watch when using the app in order to hear your updates while you run even when the watch is connected via Bluetooth to your headphones.  A little nit picky I know but it should all be able to connect and work as one.I was happy to download it, but it has had some small bugs and glitches every now and then. I‚Äôm jut happy I can use this to time my runs and track my distance with only one running item! It also keeps track of all of your runs you have ran in you Achievement/history tab. It just bugs me that if you run in an area like I do where you turn a lot it cuts the distance you actually ran and makes it a little longer than it really is! Run FunAt 59 I started jogging around in a confined space during COVID-19 surge in NY.  I‚Äôm not a runner but a walker.  NRC was recommended in an article re exercising alone.  I downloaded the app, started running with Coach Bennett and the rest is history.   I can officially say I am a Runner and I‚Äôll be ‚Äúrunning‚Äù for the rest of my life.

Take it from me, it‚Äôs the new out in these times of social distancing.  It gives the feeling of relief, relaxation and control.  I highly recommend this.
Better yet, I dare you to try it.We started to jog with the Stay at a Home hit. We are 66 and 68 year olds and have never ever jogged or run.  But we decided to try. Very slow and didn‚Äôt know how really. Both my husband and I then downloaded the NRC app and have new confidence. I love coach Bennett. The guided work outs really help by showing me it isn‚Äôt all about speed.  That each run is a story in itself.  So far I‚Äôve used the 5K , Another 5K, the 4 mile run, and the speed run.

Everyone wants to workout however with add incentive you can push them further.  This will generate more attention to the app, stores and the free items will be advertised global on social media.

From a recording at 4:45am I heard two men whispering in the background and you could hear one of them saying “did you put it in the bag?” And the other said “yea”. Im a single woman living alone. Once I heard it the next day I called the cops and they did a full swoop of my house and confirmed they heard voices in the recording. Being that I heard the sound the next day there was not much the police could do and suggested I reach out to the app to see if they could send me a longer version or the recording etc..

I sent an email to the apps customer service. I heard nothing for 3 days and emailed them again. I then got a response after a week saying “thank you we will pass along your feedback”. I wasn’t giving feedback I was inquiring about my safety and well being and asking for their help as I was fearful someone broke in. For an app that costs $40 a month I’d expect the customer service to be helpful and not robotic and disregard all requests. Is a shame bc I actually enjoyed the app but don’t want to promote or give money to a service that doesn’t care about their users well beingI’d like to know how it thinks I’m asleep when I’m up moving around carrying my phone with me. There needs to be a way to say “no I didn’t fall asleep in 17 minutes, I’m 43 and have never fallen asleep in 17 minutes, even when I haven’t slept at all the night before because I have raging insomnia.” At first I thought it was tracking my husband who falls asleep in seconds, but nope. We slept in separate rooms for a week. How am I asleep when I’m adjusting the phone volume or switching to a different recording to play? There’s no way to leave feedback when you wake up about how you slept or anything, just the three stupid emojis. Waste of money.

After their response is like to update. Says if I don’t make much noise moving around it won’t register it. Let me clarify. I live in a house with 6 children. It is NEVER quiet. How much noise do I have to make? “Call the cops bcuz there’s an intruder” noise? Seriously. And again, I’m playing games on the phone the app is running on…yet I’m sleeping. The phone is being moved around…yet I’m sleeping. And apparently I sleep drive, cuz we went to the gas station once. Whatever. This app is pointless.I bought it for the white noise, which seems to be interrupted. I need it to play continuously through the night, if the app is interrupted the noise stops, it stops after 30 minutes automatically.

I know that’s not the apps intention, I don’t need tracking, I just need better white noise. 
I’d like to cancel please.Another predatory app developer,  longer I used the app the less accurate it was.  There is no support other than the standard “ Thanks for the feedback”, so save your money.",1,Terrible customer service for the monthly costNopeDon’t buy it for white noise alone.Save your money,zoshrhettBMS82216MewdaneRick Hillman,ShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker Sound,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,538,has_feedback,13

So far, it’s combining the sleep of my husband and I. The tracker shows I am in deep sleep when in fact I’m wide awake listening to my husband snore. And it recorded him coming in from work and taking medication as me teeth grinding and in deep sleep. Nope. While I am able to mark the recordings as errors, it would be nice to be able to make a quick note of why it’s an error (not my snore, I’m awake, that’s a pill bottle). It seems to me this feedback would help shuteye better identify the noises it hears to track better. I’m exhausted from little sleep and yet it states I was asleep 6:17 of the 7 I was in bed.

This app is pointless.This app is saying that I’ve fallen asleep in 8-22 minutes. But I literally lay here all night tossing and turning. It says I’m “snoring” when I’m wide awake clearing my throat. I have allergies. The only sound this thing has gotten correct was the “animal sound”.  It is not tracking sleep accurately or any of the sounds. It said I was snoring the other night and it was my roommate using a blender in the other room!  This app is a waste of time and money. I even tested it by talking.  Every so often I would just say, “I’m awake still, so if this is saying I’m in deep sleep it’s not accurate”.  I said that about five times and it did not record one time of me talking. (I thought it’s supposed to let you know if you’re talking in your sleep. It should allow us the entire recording and not snippets some Ai picked out that are not even close to being snoring or talking or deep sleep. Shoot, last night it didn’t even realize I was not sleeping and I was tossing and turning. But it didn’t pick up those sounds either. I am extremely disappointed and want a refund. Please and thank you.Although this app has helped me identify a snoring issue, it is not accurate in tracking when I am actually asleep. For example: it tracked that I fell asleep in 9 minutes, when I was actually awake. It showed I was either in deep sleep or light sleep when I had actually gotten out of bed. I started speaking during these times and started getting clips of me “talking in my sleep” saying things like “I’m awake now”. I’m pretty dubious about it’s ability to know that I’m asleep, let alone the depth of sleep I am in.

::::::::follow up:::::::::::

I received this response from the developer: ""Hi Muzzie, one reason for the discrepancy might be that the app records time spent asleep, not time in bed. Taking this into account, if you still feel Sleep Tracker has shut off prematurely, this might be caused by insufficient phone charge. Please be sure that your phone is plugged in while using Sleep Tracker. ""

lt seems that this is a response to a completely different review, as I never said the sleep tracker turned off. What I said was the sleep tracker could not discern if I were awake or asleep, as evidenced by the fact that it used clips of me saying things like “I’m awake now, just for the record” as examples of me “talking in my sleep”.  It reported that I was asleep when I was clearly awake.  Not once, but several times. 

So again, not this app is NOT an accurate tracker of sleep patterns.The one thing I like about this app is the variety of sounds you can use with the free trial.

However, the actual sleep tracking is inaccurate. My chart says I have fallen asleep in less than 15 mins, which I know is not true because I always have trouble falling asleep. Even the times when I look at the time on my phone after tossing and turning the chart does not log that I was awake. Also, I usually wake up to use the restroom every night, and sometimes the app doesn’t even log that I woke up. Additionally, sometimes I will wake up before my alarm, and the app doesn’t track it. Finally, a lot of the recorded sounds are absolutely nothing (humming of my fan, etc.). 

Overall, it seems that the app think I fall asleep immediately when I turn the sleep mode on, wake up when the alarm goes off, and only listens for big noise to signify that I am awake.I’ve had this app for 50 days and at first it was great, I’m not sure how it actually tracks your sleep because it was mostly giving me a very wavy graph. 

It also wasn’t picking up that I was awake when someone came in to talk to me early in the morning, and the app recorded both voices. I wasn’t worried about this because I usually fall asleep quickly afterwards, and it didn’t effect my overall sleep. 

The past week it has been changing my sleep graph so much that I wake up from a 8-9 hr night to a 0-50 sleep score because it thinks I only slept for 45 minutes to an hour. 

Also every time you open the app it shows you the offer to buy premium, often giving a deal. You can not use the app until you exit the ad, and sometimes you have to wait for the wheel to spin and land on jackpot before the X pops up. Once I’ve initially declined the premium membership I don’t want to continue to see pop ups about it. There are some features that are unavailable without premium (which is fine by me), and in opening these one could go about purchasing the premium. We don’t need it shoved in our faces every time we open the app when we’re trying to go to sleep.Other than recording noises, its not accurate.  1) ai have dx sleep apnea, waiting on my machine and the app since I started using it not once registered anything but ZERO for my apnea. 2) the sleep tracking is not correct.  Just last night it took me from 10pm to at least midnight (the last time I looked at the time) to fall asleep and it says it took me 24 minutes and says I was asleep for 7 hours 40 mins. No way I was. Midnight to 6 am is not 7 hours 40 minutes.   I am going to be asking for a refund. Does not do as advertised.The recordings it made were all errors. The app tracked my spouse and my dog but not me even though the phone was next to me. It said I had bruxism when it was a door closing. 
It won’t give me a Sleep Score until I use it for 7 nights! Useless!
Every time I opened the app it asked me to rate it. This is on the premium version. I got tired of seeing it so here is my rating.
There is no connecting to my Apple Watch so no heart rate information. All the features can be found free in other apps so don’t bother with this one.This app continues to self terminate without direction from the user.  If you wake during the night look at your phone bam automatically stops and assigns a nights sleep score.  Not cool for folks trying to keep a running rally on total sleep values.  Maybe they will address this.  Auto analysis should not happen after three hours unless the user is prompted.  END your sleep?  Nope it ends sessions for you.  Please correct this.
MarcIt really doesn’t track well. I have chronic pain and insomnia. When I wake up at night I always look at the clock and check it again  and again. Anyone with insomnia will understand that. Unfortunately the app records me in a deep sleep mostly. I have sent messages through the app and never get a reply. I would look for a different if you are serious about tracking your sleep.So first off the only good this a rain sounds but they stop playing later on second I started recording and i went to sleep like 10 hours and i wake up and it says “Quit tracking?
You've slept less than 30 min, not long
enough to generate a detailed sleep report.” Ad ive been recording all night if it does not work in a few days im probably better off deleting it and going on something else.The sleep tracking is good but the alarm has changed on its own every night. I consistently set it to 7am-7:30am but get woken up by this stupid app at anywhere from 5-6 am. Double Checked all my other alarms and can’t figure it out. Even take screenshots every night and morning to make sure I’m not going insane. Really would like a refund if this can’t be figured outWorst app ever!  I’ve tried to use it several nights using different variations from listening to nature sounds to silence.  Every morning when I wake up I go to quit tracking and it pops up a message saying “It’s been less than 30 mins, not enough data to generate a report.” Don’t waste your time or money with this one!!!!  I’ve had far more success with the free version of Sleep Cycle.This app has sounds to help you sleep but as far as sleep tracking, it is complicated and useless. Plus, it records My husband’s snoring as MY snoring! Don’t waste your money. Many nights, I set it to track my sleep and upon awakening, it recorded NONE of my sleep. It was a very expensive app and had some good reviews but it is not worth even using for free.I bought it for the white noise, which seems to be interrupted. I need it to play continuously through the night, if the app is interrupted the noise stops, it stops after 30 minutes automatically.

I know that’s not the apps intention, I don’t need tracking, I just need better white noise. 
I’d like to cancel please.I was willing to try the “free trial” but I was charge that very day. When I tried the app, it didn’t track my night’s sleep even though I turned tracking on. When I went to cancel the subscription after 4 days, it canceled I didn’t get my money back.
Don’t try this app, unless you want to give money away.So I basically downloaded it and I didn’t want to sound track no more and it asked why did u want to stop tacking with a smiley face and I was like no so I deleted it don’t get it if you think some one is tracking you in your phone or iPad or anything U have in the camera of it ☹️I don’t like leaving my cell phone plugged in all night. I can’t remember to ‘start’ tracking before I go to sleep. I expected the tracker to work with my iWatch, but it doesn’t. Just disappointed with the program and technology behind it. Needs some work.The app will stop working half way through the night and I lose my tracking progress. You can not stop tracking and pick back up. I have wasted my money on this app. Do not buy the full version.The tracker is out control with the timing and with tracking the sounds.  I agreed with the other users that the price is to high when this company is having to many technical issues.  I’ll try it for the rest of the trials days and see what happens.I wake up frequently and the app stops tracking me after I wake up. I was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea through a sleep test, but the app tells me I have a “low” risk of sleep apnea. This app doesn’t work.My child woke me up SEVEN times last night. The app says I got a 94 sleep score and I should enjoy a day full of energy. Haha, nice one!  I feel like crapola.

After having it for 40 days, I’m not impressed. It “tracks” every little thing. The recordings aren’t accurate and you can’t correct the information yourself except delete the recordings. Says I have bruxism when I wear a mouth guard to prevent bruxism. And the recording literally heard nothing. Not exactly sure how it knows when you’ve fallen asleep or gone into deep sleep without tracking your heart rate or movements. All it’s doing is listening for sounds. Last night it said I fell asleep in an hour. I know that’s not possible because I was extremely tired and normally fall asleep in <15min. on regular nights. Don’t waste your money. If you want a real sleep tracker, invest in a Garmin or an Oura ring. Might be more expensive for a one time upfront cost, but at least you’ll get accurate consistent data. I’m only giving this 2 stars because I do like the sounds features. Other than that, the app is useless and unless there’s a way they can start tracking your HR there’s nothing this app can do to improve. 
Response to developer: no my phone is not shutting off prematurely. I always have it plugged in at night. Yesterday it also said I was awake for two hours in the middle of the night. When I know for a fact I wasn’t.This app is not accurate in the slightest. I paid for the full year subscription because I got a 50% discount when I logged in. However, after having for only two weeks I’m disappointed and am regretting buying. I use both my phone and this app for the tracking sleep. I also have a history of struggling to fall asleep and waking up several times throughout the night. My watch picked up on how long it took for me to fall asleep and every time I woke up. On the other hand, the app said I fell asleep in 5 minutes and never woke up. Ik this isn’t right because 30 minutes after trying to fall asleep I checked the time, and I remember waking up during the night. This app only goes off sound, there’s no way for it to get an accurate account without heart rate and movements. The only feature I do like is the sounds, and the only good part to come out of the subscription is how many of them there are. Otherwise, don’t waste your moneyGood:

This app does better than others I’ve tried at actually recording noises during the night. They are usually miscategorized, but that is not a huge issue. 

Neutral:

It does an okay job of actually tracking sleep. It’s accuracy is far from perfect. It often “misses” my wake ups during the night, for example. But it’s at least as good as other trackers I’ve tried and maybe a bit better. 

Bad:

It’s impossible to change their suggestions. It asked me what my ideal sleep schedule would be. However, my ideal is not realistic (since my job wants me there at 8 AM not 1 PM!). I didn’t realize I would never be able to change. The app now thinks I should go to bed at 1:30 and get up at 9. I could that for a couple days before getting fired maybe. 

It is very naggy. Get up when you wake up that’s 30 minutes earlier than usual? Nag. Go to bed earlier or later? Nag. I get that consistency is good, but this seems to be totalitarian in outlook. 

Speaking of totalitarian, the text suffers from a subpar English translation. It’s easily understandable, but just different enough to make you recall that it is, in fact, translated. It makes me wonder how safe my data is. 

Summary:

I probably won’t renew this when it comes due. It is okay, but for me the lack of customizability/flexibility outweighs the decent recording ability. I will look for another solution down the road.I don’t care for this app. The white noise options are way too many and I have sleep sounds I prefer which can’t be played in the background. The sounds can only be played for 120 minutes as well. They are also recorded as loud noises and give a negative score for your sleep. 4 consecutive days it told me it needs 4 more days to get an accurate score which would put it out of the trial period. I guess that’s one way to force you to pay for it. You have to keep your phone plugged in and near your head which isn’t healthy and even apple has recommended you the phone away from bed.  I don’t use an alarm or use my phone for at least an hour after waking but this app encourages both. It not for me. Speaking of alarms though theirs is ok. The ukulele sound is cute and the puppy visual is cute.  Gif be better off with other sounds and meditating though for good sleep rather than relying on this .First off, I missed where they said they were gonna charge me $60. That was a surprise. (I guess that’s the perk of an app that you use when you are you’re most tired. 

Second, the app stopped working after only a few days. It records nothing now, even when I know I’ve had a conversation. It also isn’t even recording the correct time anymore. I work 3rd shift and have an odd sleep schedule. Last “night” I started the app around 9 am and slept until 5 pm. The app shows I slept 12:51 am-6:51 am...

Third, the meditations restart when they’ve finished playing. There have been times that I’ve been right on the edge of sleep and the meditation restarts, waking me up. 

Fourth, the wake up feature DOES NOT work for me. If I do not set a backup alarm, I will not wake up. I don’t know if it’s even going off or just so subtle that I don’t hear it or what.

Fifth, many times when I do finally wake up, the app is already off and only tracked for about 30 minutes. 

While hearing the sounds that occur while I’m sleeping was neat, it is definitely not $60 neat. And my FitBit does a much better job at ACTUALLY tracking my sleep.I loved this app a lot. I didn’t pay for premium, because it’s way too expensive for me, but I really liked the features that it gave me without premium. It was usually pretty accurate, but some mornings, I would wake up and the app had just stopped tracking my sleep on its own which was very annoying. Just recently, I started playing music to help me fall asleep, and the music messed with the tracker, so I had to stop doing that, but last night, I didn’t have music playing, and it told me I got one minute of sleep even though I know I slept for at least seven and a half hours. I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m really upset that it’s not working anymore.I don’t know what happened. This was a great app until the last update. Now I’m getting a 97% score (previously mid 60’s), giving me 8+ hours of sleep.. even though I have almost 2 hours of awake time in between. 

You are counting from the moment I set the app until I physically tap awake. This app used to give me the amount of light and deep sleep I acquired, as well as the correct amount of time it took me to fall asleep.. it reported 7 minutes last night, even though I read for almost an hour. Like I said, it used to be accurate. 

I was considering the upgrade, but I’m looking into other apps.I have only been using for 3 days, and so far...

Music/sound options are varied and pleasant, but stops so abruptly when the sleep timer activates that it wakes me up. Also, audio stops when the phone is turned off, so then phone is on all night. The tracking doesn’t appear to be quite accurate either but could mostly be unclear labeling. 

This app has a lot of potential and I hope you keep working on it, but it needs some major improvement to be worthy of a subscription fee.This app attempts to track your sleep through your iPhone microphone. It picks up snoring and other noises. You have to activate it manually before you go to sleep. I was assuming it would be way more sophisticated and use my Apple Watch to detect motion, heart rate, etc. The sleep tracking app on my Fitbit from 6 years ago was ten time more sophisticated than this. 
I’m just hoping I don’t have to follow through cancelling this before I’m charged $60 because the language is pretty ambiguous when you try to cancel. Very disappointed.Some days it records, other days it skips, even though it asks me to “quit” recording in the morning.  My alarm is not reliable.  It rings at a different time than it’s set for, or frequently doesn’t ring at all.  

‘Probably not ShutEye’s problem, but my Bouvier sleeps in the floor beside me; I’m not sure if it’s tracking her snoring or mine.  I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and thought this would be a great tool for me.

Maybe my household is too complicated.  I’m not sure how it would distinguish between bed partners??App registers all noise in room,which in my case, includes one other person and a dog, both of whom snore and move around a lot. This gives the app the impression I am getting very light sleep and other disastrous results, such as sleep apnea (dog snoring). In the morning I feel disappointed when I see my low score. I don’t know why I am still using it. Maybe because it’s funny to record all the farts. I cannot recommend this app for anyone who is not a solo sleeper. Will finally delete tonight. Sorry I paid.I really liked the app, it was pretty accurate on my nighttime wake ups and tracking my sleep. But since the upgrade there have been several instances of me getting out of bed and it doesn’t show in the tracker, also there have been times that it shows I was in bed for way longer than I actually was, and have had times that I was in bed for over 15 hours, when I definitely had hit wake up.So I have a lot of trouble falling asleep and waking back up and I was referred to this app, and the tracking was actually okay. I was interested in the recording feature it offered but the only clips it would pick up would be the random noises in my room. The REAL issue I have with the app is the alarm set up. The alarm is SOOO peaceful I will sleep through it for 2+ hours. So sadly the app, though it has some okay features, was a failure for me.Started the first muscle relaxation session and was expecting a proper mindfulness mediation session. But instead, the narrator starts talking about about chakras and focusing on my third eye, which are a religious concept that I don‘t follow or support. Also showing horoscopes and tons of other unnecessary stuff, like News. Who would expect news in a sleep tracking app?The app is a great idea and I love the sounds, but to navigate from page to page is a nightmare.  There are no cursors or menu bars that I can see.  Somehow I finally get to the page to star the tracking.  I will be canceling my subscription.The free version offered to track your sleep, but you have to purchase the app to see the analysis. Not only that, the tracking result showed an ideal sleep pattern - yet I was awake most of the night, and my dog snored loudly as well. 

Great idea, but I'm not buying itI love this app when it works. But that is about one in three nights. Most times I wake up and it says it has been tracking lass than half an hour. So disappointing.I feel like this app could be useful to folks but mine stopped tracking my sleep after three nights. it requires seven to do a sleep analysis so I ended up canceling before the week ended.This app might be good for single people, but it picks up my husband’s snoring and movements as well as mine so it’s not useful in tracking my sleep. This morning it woke me up because it heard him get out of bed 😕I don’t know why this sleep app came up when I searched for Apple Watch sleep apps when it doesn’t work on the Apple Watch. I have no idea what it’s tracking when I don’t have my phone in the bedroom.It does not work because my phone is glitching every single second and I barely get what my sleep score",0,"This isn’t accurate…Inaccurate and awfulPretty Good Recording QualityOk at bestStopped working after a few daysstopped working all of a suddenAccurate prior to updateGreat idea, but this app is not quite there yetHow are these reviews real?I question the accuracy of the software.Doesn’t work with more than one sleeperLoved it until the updateThe music is way too peacefulMixed with religion, lots of bloated featuresApp needs better instructions on how to use it.Rip-offDoesn’t trackCould be goodGood for single peopleApples watchDoes not work",TheStinkyRebelVaVa4242CopeknightJollyRancher 47ShyDethKittenbob365<3AhdiddjenjefiuhwhehsJRMcGeeSuperfry1Bouvier babymarnieanneAlisiaRNEmory moserMitchKmannden9zmzberryTony in SeattleJenlar7983Bangingpatchoulicher901.......mila,ShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker Sound,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,1,0,2206,has_tracking,81

It worked for 3 nights. Last night the app shut itself off. I restarted it at midnight and come morning I could not even open my phone. It told me the app crashed and it locked me out of my phone by saying phone is unavailable try again in 1 minute that 1 minute turned into 5. I was able to shut my phone down buy pushing every side button at the same time. To be honest I expected this app to be so much more. It doesn’t give you a sleep score and when it tells you that it tells you when you talk in your sleep and so on. It gets it all wrong. This app needs a lot more improvement in order to tell when your awake or Animal noises is me struggling to breathe. I guess the way I look at it is this needs a lot more work because it can tell you if you have sleep apnea or not. The first night it said I had mild sleep apnea but the next night was severe and the following night it was call a doctor immediately. Just so everyone knows I am aware I have severe sleep apnea. I can not wear those masks over my face I feel like I’m suffocating.I’ve been using this now for several months. There’s a couple of things that really make me frustrated. One is in the recommended activities to do before going to bed. It has a guided meditation that you can’t select a different one. It has just one standard one that I am supposed to do nightly, and I cannot stand that one. I wish I had more of the other options that I could use to improve my sleep score. Also, when there’s a seasonal time change it counts the hours of sleep incorrectly. And, when myself or my husband because we are both using it have insomnia in the middle of the night there’s no way to pause the app to demonstrate that we are actually wide awake for a while. often it records instead that that was a period of deep sleep.When I signed up, it gave a monthly breakdown.  I got charged $30 for a year.  When I went to cancel, no refund for unused months (can still access).  That’s not cool.  

While the app is ‘unique ‘, it often misinterprets sounds.  I also don’t see how a phone that’s not physically connected to you can tell that you’re not asleep.  I often get scores that make no sense.   I wake up at 5:15 after sleeping through the night and the app says I was awake for over 2 hours (????).  I don’t really trust the results.   

At the end of the day, I don’t really need some app misinterpreting my sleep. I’m either sleeping well or I’m not.  Don’t need a blow-by-blow summary of every single thing I did during the night.I love this app, i really primarily use it for the sleep sounds and I love the smart alarm.

 I don’t think this actually “tracks” my sleep because I can be awake and rolling around bed literally all night and this app will say I slept like a rock. Also when I get out of bed to go potty, it just thinks I was really quiet for a moment. Could we add a pause button maybe? Ontop of that, usually I end up taking sleep meds or warm milk after I’ve been trying to sleep for a while and it’s not working. Could we add an update button? And what if I sleep on the couch for some reason? There’s a “new bed” option, but nothing for a couch or something like that. What if someone stays the night? There’s no option for sharing a bed. I smoke weed to sleep sometimes, where’s that option? 

Would it track my sleep better if I put my phone on my bed or in my bed frame rather than the bedside table? 

All in all, it’s a fantastic app to help you fall asleep and wake up, but not great at actually tracking your sleep patterns.I’m not a sound sleeper and I often have trouble getting to sleep. After a few nights of using the app, I couldn’t fall asleep one night so shut it down to do other things on my phone. It had recorded that I was asleep for 26 minutes when I hadn’t slept at all. It was then that I realized it was actually tracking my Great Dane, who was sleeping soundly about equidistant from the phone from where I’d been laying. I paid for a full year subscription to find out that my dog is a sound sleeper. I didn’t need an app to tell me that, or that she snores on occasion. The app also made my phone run hot.Hello! 
    I have been using ShutEye for about a year with no issue at all until New Year’s Day. At 12:00 A.M., I fell asleep. It was normal. The night after that however, I fell asleep woke up and got a message saying that I had only been tracking 30 minutes, when I am certain that I tracked all night. This kept happening until January ninth, then it went back to these messages saying I’ve only been tracking for less than 30 minutes. When I went on to write this review, there was an update which I had no prior knowledge of. Please fix this issue! 

Sincerely, Miss Violet Helen WiedmanThe set up, displays, graphs, music are all great … as along as you aren’t concerned with anything other than the time you fell asleep and the time you woke up. If you want to know the quality of your sleep, which is what graph is for, that’s a no go for me. It never catches when I wake up in the middle of the night - the dog has to go out, I start coughing, or other reasons. If I start talking it just thinks it’s back ground noise. I got a score of 95% last night when I must have woke up 4 times an hour. It was a terrible night’s sleep. Definitely not 95%I’ve been using the app for almost 2 years. My subscription stopped working, then when they resolved the issue, I lost all of my data. They didn’t even offer any type of compensation for the 2 years of tracking that was deleted A free year would have been nice.  Now, 20 days later I’m having the same issue even though I have a subscription until next May. I’m about to jump ship to another app that is highly recommended.I’m still in the trial phase, probably not going to keep it. I’ve learned better sleep habits but it doesn’t seem to track my sleep. 

Never fallen asleep to a sound machine before. My husband said he slept so well on my first night. The second, he fell asleep before me so I turned it on and managed to fall asleep fast before I did my normal night time routine to get tired. 
Also, I am awful in the mornings. 3 alarms, I’ll snooze for over an hour, and still struggle to get out of bed. I risked it and set this alarm for the gradual wake up at my last usual alarm time. While I still didn’t want to get out of bed, I was easily awake!

For the sleep tracking, not one clip I’ve listened to has been me. It is all my husband so I’m not getting any information on my sleep. I’ll get a different app for the sounds and alarm for free.Well designed and attractive app. Has a lot of promise, but as some of the other reviews mention, it is hard to tell when you’re asleep if it isn’t tracking heartbeat too. If you have a spouse or significant other who also snores or makes sounds too, this likely won’t work because their noises will be picked up as disturbances causing you to delete the report for that day.After a few days of tracking my sleep I realized that the app is picking up my husbands snoring and sleep habits. I know I had a good night sleep and yet the app indicated I was awake from 1-2 am. As it turns out my husband was awake at tat time. This happened more than once. The information was interesting but not completely accurate.Lately, It has been acting up like it turns off before I even wake up. So my sleep score has been a zero for two days now, and I don’t even know what happens when I’m sleep. I don’t know if I sleep talk, is there noise or is it raining. U can’t even tell you because it is broke so please fix this.🙂😊The app is only okay. My wife and I go to sleep at different times most nights and the app says I wake up when she comes in so it doesn’t continue tracking my sleep. Other times it will rack us both so I get recordings of both of us.I’m not about to pay 30$ just to know is I snored or not and that’s all I wanted to track but the only thing it did good at is tracking my deep and light sleepIt’s nice to go to sleep to music but I haven’t found any tracking results in the a.m.",0,"I have severe Sleep ApneaNot worth the money, but interestingOne year subscription only optionI have improvement requests.I thought the numbers might be off..Issues with the appDoesn’t tract accuratelySubscription IssuesPros and consCould have been a contenderNot sure this is working for meBROKEN!!!It’s okayThis app is a no go for me!I like ethe idea",Kwluv44ADD txMbrown 1958BotchedBabejustno9Pink Narwal123kbgcsbp5HE1001dnotsonicedesignisgoPortJeffGirlfjhchr dhheNin Jarobitzz_rettaEgie5,ShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker SoundShutEye Sleep Tracker Sound,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,1615,has_tracking,81

However, there’s one major problem that I have with it: it effectively assumes that the time between you waking up and you stopping the app is just you forgetting to turn it off. This has been a major issue for tracking my sleep quality, because a lot of the time, the actual scenario is “I woke up several hours earlier than I intended to, lay in bed trying to fall back asleep for two hours, and then gave up.” This results in the app thinking my sleep quality as lower on days where I AM successful in falling back asleep than the days where I’m not, which is obviously a major issue when my goal is to track insomnia. Would absolutely change this to 5 stars if the app developers added a way to tell the app whether you were awake but forgot to turn it off or you were trying to sleep the whole time it was running, and adjusted sleep quality accordingly.I am amazed by the apps ability to do exactly what it says it can. I’m in the middle of my free trial but almost certain I will purchase a yearly subscription. 

The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the user interface is not the best, and in my short time has had a couple of bugs. If you say you want to start a sleep tracking accidentally, it doesn’t give you an option to cancel so you have to force close the app and open again. It also got stuck on the weather forecast for me when opening once. I don’t need a weather update when I open a sleep app. I have a weather app or Alexa for that. I think it’s neat it tacks the weather with your sleep to help provide answers to troublesome sleep but that is all I need it for.I like how this app can detect when you fall asleep and wake up. It’s a good app to get when your main goal is tracking your sleep. However, if you’re getting this app to hear yourself talking or snoring, or whatever you do in you sleep please note that it cost money. It may be just me but I really wish this app wasn’t as expensive, as I was very excited to hear the recordings of my sleep last night and instead was taken to an subscription add. I can understand where they come from and why they make it cost. If this is the case I don’t understand the point of saying you can click on something and use it when really you have to buy it.So I was listening to white noise and I clicked to start tracking and guess what I turned off tracking because i wasn’t ver tired and it said I was sleeping for 5 hours? Like what… so I don’t know if this is even real- it said I was snoring at 3am and I wasn’t even awake for a minute I didn’t even go to bed soo…I would just be careful while using this because this is faking my sleep fix this?!Although I did not want to pay, they had a wheel to get a percentage off! Even just with it free, it’s very helpful. It said I woke up at 3:00
am which I did not, tracking my sleeping information incorrectly. I 
will continue using this app, with hopefully no more problems.Love the meditations. And sleep tracking. Cannot sign in on my iPad Air. My old iPad glitches every time I open the app.  I have to restart on my iPhone. When I want to listen to a different meditation.

It helps me fall asleep right away without having to watch TV. I also love how it tells you about why your having certain dreams and I think that's really cool. In the white noise, they have so many things like rain, fire place, exhaust fan, ocean waves, seagulls, keyboard, and MORE. 
I think that you should get this app because not EVERYTHING requires premium like a few things do, but not a lot. Also the premium is only around $2.99 a month! It's so nice. I have been able to sleep so much better from this app. 
It also tracks your sleep if you press the sleep button in the center of your screen and you answer questions like how have you been feeling (it gives you multiple choice or you can choose other) then, you set your phone next to your bed on the charger and when you go to sleep, it tracks if you talked, snoring loud or tossing and turning. It also tells you your sleep score after six days of tracking your sleep with the app, and it tells you how much light sleep or heavy sleep. It's cool to listen to what you said in your sleep, what you did, or how much you snored. 
This app is very good for me because i haven't been able to fall asleep. But this app makes me fall asleep right when i turn on the white noise or sleep meditation. 

⚠GET THIS SLEEP APP IF YOU HAVE SLEEP PROBLEMS / WANT TO TRACK YOUR SLEEP/ FALL ASLEEP FASTER!!! ⚠I love this app just for the sleep aid sounds alone! It has free features where you can create your own white noise combo (I like rain on tent + gentleness). You can even save your combos that you make. I also love that there’s stories, music, and other sleep aids! I haven’t been sleeping well lately and falling asleep is especially hard but this knocks me right out! I don’t find much use for the sleep recording because my fiancé snores very loudly so it’s really tracking his sleep, not mine. Overall, I highly recommend for sleep aids!I love the white noise it provides. If I have ringing in my ears or trouble falling asleep I can try out new sounds. It measures sleep score and time asleep, but which is very helpful and I think it helps me improve my schedule at night. I used it almost every day for a month, and I saw it on an ad. I think that even if you don’t have trouble sleeping, this helps to see the quality or just get sleep sounds. This also helps if you have trouble sleeping, it helped me at least. Thanks ShutEyelove the app, getting to hear what I say in my sleep is always funny, though sometimes talking gets placed in other categories (usually something like coughing). Since the most recent update, however, it’s prompted me every time I’ve opened to app to consult a doctor due to a purported elevated risk of sleep apnea despite the sleep tracker never having given me a sleep apnea risk score above mild. I feel like this is probably a bug, unless there’s something I’m missing.(there are not enough words to describe)

I have been using this app for about a week, and I can say that it has helped me A LOT. I love you can make your own mixes and that you get a score each morning you wake up. I think it's interesting that you can hear what you did when your sleeping. All and all I love the app. 5 out of 5 stars!! 

(so far this app has made me very happy, I would love to keep using it)This is the best sleep app I have. I like that it recorded my cat meowing last night it was so pitiful.😻great job with this app. One thing I don’t like is it shuts off for no reason while I’m asleep.

There’s no X out of that screen. To get the sleep information, I have to swipe out of the app, remove its history, reopen the app and click on statistic from the previous evening. Seems like it’s a glitch that needs addressing. Please add an x or allow the screen to give the sleep information promptly after showing the weather. I have a rather app after all…I bought a subscription to Shut Eye to show me how I sleep. Thank youI love it but maybe you could have it so that the sounds to go to sleep by were longer and have a few more options for people who can not afford or choose not to go premium, I would honestly be surprised if during the review of how I sleep you didn’t pick up me telling the story of Cinderella.",0,Great!

My only suggestion or request was going to be to add more of the whispered stories. Now that I updated the one story I listened to every night because  is gone????? Why? 😔 at least bring back the Alice in Wonderland story. Geez :(,0,Not really sure what happened..,Emphases,ShutEye Sleep Tracker Sound,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,65,has_narrative,13

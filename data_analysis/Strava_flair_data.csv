The features Strava provided in addition to GPS tracking were awesome and over the years have motivated me to become a better athlete. Some of the best features I am referring to are comparing past times and leaderboards. I even wrote an essay in my college Health Promotion class about how good Strava is at motivating people to be healthier and become better athletes. Unfortunately, Strava decided to make these features Subscription-only in the latest update, which greatly disappointed me. I can no longer compare past times or use the leaderboard, which were some of the best features. If Strava is struggling financially, I would gladly put up with a few ads in the app. However, they have decided to make you pay $60 to use the basic features. I hope these recent reviews will help them realize the impact Strava has made in the lives of many athletes and restore the basic free features.Latest update is really ill advised. For me what set Strava apart from the hundreds of other fitness trackers was the segment leaderboard and segment history features. With these core features now behind a very expensive paywall, I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôll possibly attract new users (no one is going to just jump in and start paying the huge premium without understanding these features first hand).  And, as current users who are unwilling or unable to pay the large premium slowly move away from the app, the leaderboard concept loses much of it‚Äôs value.  What fun is competing over and over against the same 3 people in town who choose to be subscribers!? Seems like a death spiral in the making. Really weird and unfortunate ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù! I had been seriously considering signing up for the premium service, but this update struck me as really obnoxious, and also makes me question whether the leaderboards will even be worth paying for in a few months once everyone leaves.I love the layout of Strava, but it‚Äôs not a great business model to give users features only to slowly take them away (leaderboards, weekly mileage) to try to get them to buy premium. At some point I‚Äôm going to get annoyed enough that we can no longer access simple features like weekly mileage or get tired of the constant pop-ups prompting me to buy premium. There‚Äôs a lot of alternatives on the market (Garmin Connect, RunKeeper, MapMyRun) that offer the same features, so Strava should be capitalizing on the popularity they have and trying to find a way to make that profitable without removing existing (simple, honestly) features, rather than slowly driving people away by trying to force purchase of premium ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è tracking weekly mileage is the bare minimum of a functioning exercise app.For us non subscribers, the features Strava keeps taking away, have made this app worthless in terms of being a social site. All this app can do (unless you pay for it) is track your daily times and show you how far behind from the top ten you are. And it doesn‚Äôt even do that accurately when compared to other gps apps. I was tempted to pay because I missed the leaderboards. But after this latest low blow to get more subscribers I‚Äôve become more determined to find a new app. The social aspect was the only thing keeping me with Strava as I am not a professional, I‚Äôm not training for anything, and I can‚Äôt even ride all year long in my state.  So disappointed in how the executives have decided to run Strava. Who are you taking advice from? A teenager?Strava used to be really good as a free app. Now with recent updates, they have taken a lot away. Such as building your route, leaderboards and tracking weekly progress. I can no longer go in and view last weeks mileage as of August 15th 2020. What‚Äôs the point of tracking mileage, if you can‚Äôt see previous weeks? I think taking free features away and hiding them behind a paywall is a very poor business model. Shame on you Strava. It‚Äôs not like they came out with new features and charged you for those. Might I make a suggestion as well. Your segments are great, but you should put what that person ran total mileage and total average pace as well. That way you can see who was sniping segments vs the real runners who just took segments while on a normal run.In the most recent update they are removing certain leaderboard and segment features from non-subscribers. For those that enjoy interacting with free users in clubs on the leaderboards its a huge mistake. Definitely considering cancelling my subscription over this greedy move.

Anytime a company starts restricting already-free features to subscribers instead of introducing new features, that‚Äôs an immediate red flag. Why would you reduce the reasons people get into the app? Why not instead improve the features for current subscribers? This move is directly going to reduce my friends who use the app since majorly competitive segments will now be locked to top-10 only. Goodbye competitive spirit hello paywall.Everything useful to long time users has been moved behind a pay wall:
- elevation adjusted pace
- leaderboards
- segment performance comparison over time across repeat workouts 
- comparison against friends and people you follow

If taking features away wasn‚Äôt enough now you throw it in our face with annoying ads to pay for premium service. Note: you make money off of us dedicated long time users because you have our data and usage to improve the app and develop routes which you sell and charge for. 

On top of that, you don‚Äôt have interval training features, you can‚Äôt edit/add gear using the app, and the performance of the app is dismal. Watch app won‚Äôt load. Watch app crashes. Phone app doesn‚Äôt log elevation, distance, or time accurately when comparing to garmin and other devices. Not just a few feet elevation or distance but we‚Äôre talking hundreds of feet of elevation and miles of distance off from other devices. Uploads fail. I‚Äôm ready to leave you!Classic money grabbing company. They used to offer a leaderboard with the free version. Now they want you to pay for everything. This app no longer offers anything unique to the other apps which are free. Don‚Äôt waste your time dealing with an app that tracks your workout and constantly shows you all the cool things you could pay for. All your doing is giving up privacy rights with no trade off. Really disappointed with the company for making this change, I hope everyone else is fed up enough to uninstall so they can see the mistake they made.Ok, so I downloaded Strava because I was looking forward to enjoying the clubs and the leaderboards, as well as looking forward to sharing my photos with the activity stats on them. However, upon using the app, I‚Äôm getting constant errors when I‚Äôm looking at clubs members list like ‚ÄúSomething went wrong, please try again‚Äù Errors, and I‚Äôm not finding ANY OTHER OPTIONS to share my photos with activity stats other than just sharing a link to the activities themselves.  This app needs some serious fixing before I download it again. If you don‚Äôt like all these errors, don‚Äôt sign up or download this app!!!!I love using Strava, but now they‚Äôre making you pay for many of its best features. It‚Äôs a shame to see this app go downhill so rapidly in a shameless effort to make a profit. Now Strava only lets you see the leaderboard if you‚Äôre in the top 10. It seems like they only care about the athleticism of the fastest men. Women need to pay to see their leaderboard, as do people of different body types and ages. So unless you‚Äôre one of the fastest, Strava is going to milk you for all you‚Äôre worth. It‚Äôs a shame that the ruined an app that encouraged people to go out and be active with a little friendly competition.Been using Strava for four years now, and so far have been very pleased with the app but this recent update in regards to premium and subscriptions has ruined the app for me. Now requiring me to pay $60 for a subscription so I can compare my previous times on segments/routes, and to see my rank on the leaderboard, both previously free features and personally the main reason I enjoyed this app over others. Always thought the premium features looked neat but unnecessary for me and I was happy with the free features the app had already. Disappointed Strava chose to go this way with the paid subscriptions and features.I‚Äôve had Strava for years now and really loved it. With the recent update there‚Äôs basically no reason to use Strava unless you need a simple map/tracking app. I have an Apple Watch so the app is essentially useless to me. I loved the matched runs/leaderboard/other stats. I understand taking away some of the more advanced features but taking away the simple leaderboard feature?? Doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs ironic because I was actually considering the premium version before this left a bad taste in my mouth. Sad to say I will be switching to another app with more features and less pushing of it‚Äôs premium version.I understand that a company is supposed to generate revenue.  But are you joking.  I have used Strava for years and all of a sudden I need to pay 60$ to look at a leaderboard of times, even against my friends.  Kinda thought Strava would stay this cool app that was community friendly and supported and helps athletes grow.  Turns out they only want to give you even half-useful data for a price.  Can‚Äôt wait to see all the other apps that use the segments from Strava get completely ruined.  Waiting for a good alternative, any developers get to work, I would even be fine with seeing ads for a carbon-copy of old Strava.I‚Äôve been a Strava user since 2015, and have enjoyed using the app until this new update. The one thing I loved about the app was being able to compare my segment times to my friends and the other people on that app, as I am a very competitive person. But now you have to pay to see where you stand on the leaderboards, which I think is very stupid. The free app didn‚Äôt offer much other than tracking your distance, time calories, etc. but at least it had leaderboards. Now it doesn‚Äôt even offer that without making you pay. Probably won‚Äôt use the app anymore.Strava used to be a good ‚Äúsport social network‚Äù. But the company greedy ness and unwillingness to fix the app makes for a very, very poor experience.
Never implemented the ability to add/edit segments on the app. Never implemented the ability of add/edit gears (shoes/bikes) on the app.
They already took away the integration with Relive, which was what ‚Äútranslated‚Äù the boring stats of our rides to a nice video so other people could understand and actually feel like joining in.
They also removed the ability to use BT/ANT+ sensors with the app, claiming it was causing crashes (how about fix the app then?!?).
Now we lose proper access to the segment leaderboards. 
What‚Äôs the point of having all the ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù aspect that make people want to use the app in the first place, if it‚Äôs behind a paywall? Might as well go full paid service! At least it will be honest, stating that you don‚Äôt care with the core community, just with the money....I‚Äôve been using Strava for 6 years and it‚Äôs been a game changer I train better and I improve when I use the app. My favorite features of the app were the leaderboards which pushed me to go faster and the route builder which pushed me to go further. Im very disappointed that Strava got greedy and decided to limit these features to only people that pay them, this makes the app basically the same as map my ride which is what I will be switching to until the leaderboards and route builder come back.I was just beginning to get hooked Strava and as a casual rider would even pay $2-3/mo. But $60? I‚Äôll put that toward a new dropper post.

The problem is that the app is near worthless relative to other tracking apps without the subscription. I can‚Äôt even see my prior rides to compare times without a subscription. Suggestion  to Strava if they care to keep me or many here
1) keep personal segments and tracking free. Without it, you‚Äôll lose your free base
2) create a mid-tier for basic leaderboards, such as the overall leaderboard and maybe friends. I‚Äôd pay $2 maybe $3 per month
3) create the upper tier with all the fancy leaderboards, deeper analytics, etc. charge $5-10 for those who care enough

This keeps you free base with enough features and history to stay, while monetizing more. Lose the base and your future profits will drop. Best of luckStrava, use to be free.  Then they started charging for it a couple years ago. Then the price went up, then it went up more, now it has gone up again.  For what???? A bunch of useless things 99% of people don‚Äôt want or need.  I quit.  Cancel my subscription. Strava:  let me know when I can see the leaderboard part for free or for $2 bucks a month again & maybe I‚Äôll renew my subscription.  So disappointed in you Strava.  You‚Äôve gotten greedy just like everyone else.They have removed the free feature that shows your leaderboard ranking. You have to pay $3 a month to see it now. üëé that‚Äôs the only reason I was using this app. I know some of you are saying $3 a month that‚Äôs cheep. But i am tired of this monthly subscription crap. You use to be able to buy a program and you owned it. Now they know they can make way more money setting you up on auto pay and slowly bleeding your bank account. So I‚Äôm just tired of the greed.I‚Äôve used Strava since 2012 and participated in the big update a few years ago as a beta tester. I was a heavy user of segment prior to the update but have found that it is unusable in its current state. I have hundreds of QOMs but no longer ‚Äúplay‚Äù on the leaderboards. The options to filter (climb the leaderboard or explore new segments) is simply useless. I continue to download updates in the hopes that this will be corrected but am now leaving this review‚Ä¶. Please fix my (previously) favorite app!The latest few updates have made this app pretty useless for its free users. They have taken away the ability to see leaderboards for free. This was pretty much the main feature of the app as it allowed you to compete against people and see where you stack up. Now the app is full of micro transactions. All of this monetization to use features that used to be free. Guess we‚Äôll have to find a new app to take it‚Äôs place.This was a proper greedy move by this company to take the existing data and features of the user and then shove it to subscription services. I‚Äôm going to delete this app and not use it again as I have no reason to do so anymore. It was a good app with leaderboard, weekly run and route making but when the company gets lazy they try to simply con the subscribers instead of providing new features.Instead of innovating and trying to add new features to get more paid subscribers they started taking features away from the free version. I can‚Äôt see my segment leaderboard position, or even check my weekly mileage anymore without paying. I guess it‚Äôs time to delete this and log it in a good old note book once again. It‚Äôs a shame too because I was about to subscribe before they screwed the app up, but now I just flat out don‚Äôt want to support this.this used to be a fantastic app. it was a perfect way to show others what you did and a great way to compare yourself to others so you can better yourself as an athlete. but this latest update changed that. you are no longer able to see more detailed leaderboards for the segments. it is now required to pay for these basic features. especially in these times when numerous races are cancelled and that was a great way to pace and compare yourself to others in ways that you couldn‚Äôt right now. this was a terrible decision from the developers during these time when you should be making things easier for the people trying to stay active during these times.I started using Strava a couple years ago to track my mountain biking progress. 

At the time I had access to the leader board and could see all my previous ride time comparisons. 

Then one day they decide those along with other features should be paid for. Well the reason Its not worth paying for those features is simple: there is no honesty in strava. The leaderboard is filled with people on ebikes, even though there is an ebike category, so it makes the competitive aspect of the app completely useless. Koms mean nothing when the playing field isn‚Äôt even. 

So to pay five dollars a month just to see my own times from previous rides isn‚Äôt really worth the subscription trap.This is terrible!! I‚Äôve been using Strava for years now and they recently removed leaderboard info for non paying customers. I get that there is a paid for version and a free version but to take away features that we‚Äôve been used to is a terrible move and makes me want to start using a different app. I guess I‚Äôll have to start shopping around. Any good suggestions?Why did Strava remove the segment leaderboards? That was the only reason I used Strava - to compete with friends. This would have been 5 stars, but I don‚Äôt have a steady source of income right now, and I don‚Äôt plan on getting the subscription. There is now no reason for me to keep using Strava. I think I might leave :(

This app was fun to use, but ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù isn‚Äôt fun. It‚Äôs like paying to exercise.

I‚Äôll update this as changes take place.",0,MTBJP77CapOneScksmonrasmuswamslaXC_Runner09Mothyberrylacrosse.callsad since new updateSTANDARD_DEVIATIONbailrooKeepSingleTrackSinglelishoooo34Yikes Guysangryshrimp37Rhobsonjuan 69420BdnillyJED123AZO my!

But it‚Äôs a shame they decided to paywall the leaderboard and a few of the things that didn‚Äôt use to be paywalled. I don‚Äôt fault them for wanting to make money, but I just don‚Äôt care enough about those features to pay as much as they‚Äôre charging, and so maybe I‚Äôll use the app from time to time going forward, but now I don‚Äôt have a compelling reason to, since that was the fun part (as they know).

So II guess what I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs not worth $8 a month unless maybe I was still competitively racing -but I‚Äôm not. And it‚Äôs a shame they made the changes and took away most of the value of the app. But I guess that‚Äôs the point.I don‚Äôt know how got the idea that segments leaderboards should only be available for people with strava premium. Leaderboards are one of my favorite things about strava and now I have to pay if I want to see them? Hellll no, Strava used to be my favorite app, but I honestly might just stop using it and use finalsurge exclusively with this bs. If you‚Äôre not getting enough people buying strava premium, add something useful to it that actually helps training, don‚Äôt take away a feature from non-paying users in the hopes that they start paying, it ain‚Äôt gonna work.Longtime (free) Strava user here. I‚Äôm a recreational rider who rides 3-4 times a week and always liked to track my segments and performances throughout the year. All of the other premium features were not enough for me to warrant an actual paid subscription. So what do the owners of Strava decide to do in the middle of a Worldwide pandemic? Decontent the free app and try and squeeze a few more bucks out of the millions of loyal users. Segment history: GONE. Basic Leaderboard stats: GONE. Great job Strava. Hate to do it, but I‚Äôll be testing out new tracking apps as an alternative. Reason...pure spite.I have loved Strava but today had to download an update that says it fixed bugs and now can‚Äôt even see my own data from prior rides (or leaderboards).  No warning this would happen.  The cost of the app is high.  I can understand charging to see others‚Äô times but keeping a user from seeing their own past data?  Going to start looking for alternatives.  Strava, please consider a more reasonable cost for your app and restoring personal data to the free app.Really Strava? Deciding to charge $60 annually in the midst of a pandemic for features that were previously free? Great timing. Leaderboards and the ability to see how my PRs change over time are great features and the only things I care about on the app and are now premium only. 

App works well, would have rated it 5 stars until this new update in May 2020. Too bad, have loved using the app but $60 annually isn‚Äôt worth it for a couple of exercise features.I have been riding with Strava for a few weeks now. I really enjoy the competition favor the challenges bring but when the top 7 are being completed by people with eBikes, it is super frustrating. There should be a separate leaderboard section for people who choose to ride eBikes. For your typical road bikers it become next to impossible to secure any placement above top 5. 
If they change this I would give 5 starsstrava, if you‚Äôre reading this, your decision to make segment leaderboards a premium feature is real dirty. if this had been the way it was all along, than that would be a whole different story, but updating the app just to make segments only available to view if you have premium, real messed up. a lot of people have been using segments as a normal feature of the app for so long, and it was a great way to see how you stand up against your friends. but i know i speak for the majority of users when i say that there is absolutely no chance that i will be paying a premium fee for this. i really hope you rethink this decision.",0,Wewantfuniand21crankwerks86CO Riderü¶éwillyf89Jj2892enraged senior student,"Enexpected paywalling thumbs downSegments now only for paid users???Middle of a pandemic, more users...lets decontent the app!New ‚Äúupdates‚Äù take away most features from free appPoor formApp Needs to detect eBikesvery disappointed that segments are now only premium features",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,7,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,711,has_leaderboard,60

When I first downloaded the app, I still had access to leaderboards and all that jazz, but since then Strava has thrown the subscription model at its users like so many others. ($60 a year is pretty wild if you ask me). Although I was bummed, I still enjoyed the challenges and still preferred the overall interface over Nike‚Äôs. However, over the past few months I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing an uptick in the amount of runs that don‚Äôt get tracked properly. I can‚Äôt tell you how frustrating it is to finish a long run, only to get back and look at Strava saying I‚Äôve only run 2.8 miles. Like what?? Sometimes the app won‚Äôt even track my movement at all during a run and I‚Äôll find myself on the sidewalk messing with my phone trying to close out of the app to reset it, and at times that doesn‚Äôt even fix the issue. I would rather not go back to using Nike‚Äôs app (for reasons I won‚Äôt go into), but at least their gps tracking system is solid. Strava if you see this, please address this issue. (Currently on iPhone X)Very disappointed to see the focus of Strava move from a community based fitness app to a profit driven cash grab. Maybe I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic here but the reality is I don‚Äôt have money kicking around for a Strava subscription. I accept that there are going to be aspects of the app that I won‚Äôt have access to, however I would maintain that to this point the [free] app was of 5 star quality and a must have workout tracker. After the update is an entirely different story, however. The free app has been stripped to the bare bones, no more access to segment leaderboards...I can‚Äôt even view my own previous times on segments. Honestly I leave a 3 star rating because I have loved using Strava for the past few years, in reality I should really leave a 1 star review. If you are able to afford the cost of a subscription to Strava, then by all means, it is a great app that is a fun and useful tool for tracking your workouts...BUT, I would not personally recommend the app as it currently stands unless you don‚Äôt have any other option available.I‚Äôve been using strava for 3+ years now, and was a premium subscriber for 2 of those years. I used Strava to train for my first marathon run and the insights and stats linked with my watch were invaluable. However, life events happen and I cut back on some extra spending, including unsubscribing from Strava premium (it‚Äôs pretty expensive). Now, I‚Äôm realizing everything is locked behind a paywall. I can‚Äôt even see my best efforts now?? That‚Äôs a bit much. I get that certain features are premium tier (3D maps, effort levels), but things like best efforts and leaderboards should NOT be premium only. This is exploitation and although a lot of people will cave in the short term it will lead to a decrease in subscribers in the long run as people find other apps that don‚Äôt paywall basic features.You guys at strava really screwed the people who liked using this app for free . Now we can‚Äôt see out weekly goals without paying and I can‚Äôt see my progression over segments without paying . I‚Äôm not talking about comparing efforts I‚Äôm just talking about seeing the ‚Äúperformance over time ‚Äú and the leaderboard are no longer available. It use to make you pay for leaderboards amongst your age group. Just a huge thumbs down from me for those two reasons . Seriously strava crew what‚Äôs the deal ? If I wanna track my ride and stats I‚Äôd use the under armor app or wahoo . 
Sincerely, 
A disappointed user .The new privacy feature really forces users to open their activities to all. Before, an activity set to private would still appear on leaderboards. Strava says they respect privacy, but force users to share all or nothing. Relative Effort is pointless as it goes by calendar week. If I do two tough workouts on the weekend, how is my Monday effort ‚Äòlower than average?‚Äô It‚Äôs annoying to repeatedly try to upload a photo to an activity in the app. I‚Äôm ready to let my subscription expire.This was a phenomenal app. I only used the free teir (was thinking about upgrading) and then they stripped free down to the bone. The segments are now useless because you cant see how fast you went compared to others. I understand they need to make revenue, but taking away the basic features that make strava strava was not the way to do it. I would be happy again if they gave back the daily and allowed us to see our position on the leaderboard.Would be 5 stars if the app actually updated club leaderboard mileage consistently. The website is just as bad. One minute it will show accurate mileage then 5 minutes later it will take away some of your rides and show less mileage. My competitive nature does not enjoy seeing less mileage on leaderboards then what I‚Äôve actually ridden. Mileage on personal profile is always accurate however.The new auto pause feature messes up constantly and now they are trying to pay to even see what place you are on the leaderboard. 60$ a Year come on. I don‚Äôt need another subscription service.

3,pos,2022-12-16 06:58:04,"While I love that in Strava I can share my runs with friends and my coach while doing challenges, I have noticed that they like to slowly take away the things you can do without buying their overpriced subscription. I have to say that I joined when segment leaderboards were still all free, routes were free, and you got a year in review of your activities at the end of the year. This was great, made me love the app, but since then it has become an app that only lets you see top overall on a segment and men and women best times. It has also made it necessary to pay for the ability to use the number of routes freely created by other users and inputted into their database. And finally very recently they made the Year in Sport exclusive to subscribers. In the end it is just a Facebook for sharing activities and adding up numbers.

I really enjoyed the leaderboard & monthly comparisons, which can now only be accessed through subscription. I would consider becoming a subscriber because I am a huge fan, but the cost has been a deterrent. I can understand their decision to  try & make the app more profitable. However, I think they should have given longtime users the option of buying those features at a lower cost. I am simply someone who loves running. But I am not training for anything & given the surgeries I‚Äôve had it is unlikely I ever will. Some of the other subscribed features may not suitable for me because of that. I want to support the app but I just don‚Äôt think the price is that accessible to everyone. I understand $60/year isn‚Äôt much, but when you‚Äôre a newly unemployed college student it‚Äôs difficult justifying that extra expense. I still really enjoy the app, I just hope these changes don‚Äôt alter how much I use it. I think if i never experienced those features I might feel differently. I am sad to see them go. Wish there was more of a middle ground for less competitive individuals.Latest version replaced the easy to read leaderboard for a segment (all time, this year, today, by weight/age) that gave you a quick view of where your effort stood on each of these (1-5 bars). 

That‚Äôs gone. Now you have to click ‚Äúsee KOM‚Äù and then click again to see where your effort places you.  No quick look just a lot of clicks. Not an improvement.  

Love the app otherwise.I was considered subscribing, but ever since Strava changed the leaderboard etc., I‚Äôve had where my Apple Watch will not synch the workout with my iPhone, and then when it appeared that was working by logging out/on, then Strava released something else this week and now my workout today did not save to the iPhone and unsynched shows 0...Many features became premium only a couple years back, so the free experience is not what it used to be, particularly segment leaderboards.

But now everything is basically premium or nothing, something as basic as weekly mileage is not premium only, all that‚Äôs left is challenges, minor statistics, leaderboards, and the standard social aspect for posting and giving others kudos. Strava was never good at connecting people with the cycling community in their area and worse now that everything is premium only.

There‚Äôs really no point specially if you have a computer, I might as well use my personal device‚Äôs app. Strava is going to die up if this goes on.I am long time premium subscriber and not only do you still not have a male leaderboard (but you have asked me to ‚Äúsubmit that request‚Äù for 4 years!!!) now you remove the training goals from athletes profile page.

It‚Äôs the best ride and run  tracker, that‚Äôs a given. But it‚Äôs also great for almost any other activity, and the social features - particularly public segments, leaderboards, photo sharing, discussions, route creation, club organization etc. etc. are extremely sticky and it‚Äôs hard to imagine any challenger ever dethroning it.

Sadly I came to find out that it‚Äôs functionality and challenges are a joke. I run an IPhone 7 (updated) and an Apple watch 3 (updated). In the 4 months since I‚Äôve been running Strava I‚Äôve had to reinstall it on my watch over 10 times (stopped counting) due to it deciding not to work with the phone app. Constant notifications asking me to re-login to the phone app when I‚Äôm staring at it open and functioning on my phone, and the new one, asking me to grant location access from my phone that‚Äôs ALREADY ON! The challenges are a joke, promising glory and prizes and then the next day some dude or dudette from who knows where has already tracked 160 miles in one day from the start of the challenge, super motivating, like watching a fellow runner jump in a cab at the beginning of a marathon. All in all, a crappy app with a toooooooon of hype. It‚Äôs nice to know a company that pulls in over $8 million a year with only 200 some odd employees can‚Äôt manage to keep the app from breaking.This app is the worst! I downloaded it to participate in a running contest with some friends. My loyalty to them is all that kept me from deleting the app the first time I used it. 

It is not at all intuitive, is less accurate than any other running app I‚Äôve used and the worst part is the Share setting. It is automatically enabled to the Everyone setting and there is no way to know that, until you inadvertently post your first run by saving it.

I‚Äôm coming back from an injury and am currently so slow I can‚Äôt keep up with my running group. Just getting out and moving again is a painful challenge and seeing my worst times posted for all the world to see made me want to give up rather than keep going.

 Fast or slow I‚Äôm not a person who likes to announce all of my activities to the world but this app only allows workouts to ‚Äúcount‚Äù toward challenges if they are posted for everyone to see. I couldn‚Äôt stomach it so I made most of my runs private and only posted enough to keep participating with my friends. I think the creators of this app should really reconsider if posting publicly should be a requirement to participate in challenges. Why does my effort only ‚Äúcount‚Äù if I brag about it? Shouldn‚Äôt it be enough for me to work privately to reach a personal goal? If my followers don‚Äôt see my run, did I even get off my couch?Strava consistently records inaccurate data. Strava reports almost mile times almost 90 seconds early. Every. Single. Time. When I‚Äôve repeatedly contacted support there is no real response besides a canned message that I ‚Äúbad gps data‚Äù or my phone is the problem... yet if I run with both Mapmyrun and Strava  open, pulling from same GPS signal, the free app has no inaccuracies and actually gives me correct info. The GPS inaccuracy is a known issue and it‚Äôs crazy to me that Strava has the gall to charge so much without support or response. I love the challenges and interface, however, reliability for accurate times is a non-negotiable.

Do better at supporting your pricey app and responding to your customer.Strava only has an iPhone app in the Apple store. It will run in 1/4 your screen, or blown up and pixelated as if it were a fisher price toy.
If you go to Strava  using Safari on your iPad, it will fail to render properly - most significantly it will not display notifications or challenges. There are other bits missing,  but those are the two I noticed. It will place a banner at the top of the page telling you to get the iPad app, but that is a lie... you will get an iPhone app.  Additionally requesting the mobile or desktop version of the website will not fix the problem. You either will be blind on notifications or you will curse and go to your desktop/laptop and log in there.The intrusive, never ending pop up ads for ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù are really killing this app. Strava, I knew about the personal group challenges when you announced them. I‚Äôve actually started one. I don‚Äôt need an interruptive full screen ad for one every 3rd time I use the app to quickly change a setting or entry. It‚Äôs infuriating. I paid for your overprice premium membership (although I‚Äôm not going to be renewing that). Just let me use the app. If you want to add features, give us parity with the website instead of the app which has been crippled for years.Strava doesn‚Äôt allow anyone to edit activities. They say this is because people would cheat on challenges and segments. 
That is a ridiculous policy for many reasons:
1. Some people forget to stop their watch/app at the end of their workout, so it logs their car ride home as part of the workout. 
2. GPS is often wildly inaccurate on small courses, like a track, where counting laps is much more accurate. 
3. Treadmill and spin workouts already don‚Äôt count towards challenges (or segments). This means the app/website already has the ability to exclude data from challenges. So make edited workouts work the same way. 

Strava‚Äôs one job is to be an accurate activity log. If it can‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs worthless. 

Still, deserves one star (not zero) because the UI is nice, and the segments are a nice way to race the neighbors or find neat spots when traveling.",0,Aaa1111wwww2222tricorder1701saduser1127Faffodjquaggatherunr,"Hot GarbageMakes me appreciate Runkeeper so much moreInaccurate data.

I understand the need to stay current and keep up with user demand which has exploded in recent months. My issue is about long time users such as myself (member since March 2013) who opted in to giving Strava our data for free in order to develop better cycling infrastructure and freely share safe routes with new users. Routes never became freely accessible, they were instantly subscription only. That stung but I accepted it. Now with the newest update we can no longer compare our segment stats with friends on Strava, besides the standard top ten, all comparisons are subscription only. This was one of my favorite features, I love seeing how I stack up against friends and it was a great selling point for me to get friends to use Strava. I have a suggestion, as unfortunate as it is, for new users this is just how it will be. However, for long time users it might be fair to let us keep our free features that made us love Strava. You gave us an incredible app that motivates and challenges a lot of people and it‚Äôs a wonderful service. I thank you for that, now please return some of the basics that we all know and love.It‚Äôs very disappointing how unreliable this app has become, in the beginning was good, now they only care about money and silly challenges. 

When I run open the app in both, Apple Watch and IPhone and always the distance is shorter on the Apple Watch between 0.1 to 0.6 miles, in top of that when I‚Äôm running I could see my moving time for mile on my phone but as soon as I finish only gives me the elapsed time which makes impossible to know the real pace. I exchanged a long chain of email with costumer service and the excuse was that ‚Äúengineers were working on the problem‚Äù, 2 months later and the same issue persists. Maps are lousy, especially in big city, it‚Äôs ridiculous that show me running on top of buildings or on the water. I just gave up and I won‚Äôt renew my subscription in June. Looking for alternatives, maybe Nike Run Club is better, or at least no as bad as this one.When I first started using the app it was only minor distance problems, like if I wanted to run a 1.5mile run then I‚Äôd have to run an extra .1 or .2 miles. But I just ran 2.5 miles and it only registered as 2, for someone who runs for time and a score a half mile is a ridiculous difference for a timed run. Idk if using WiFi or not makes a difference but that much of a difference pretty much makes the app useless. It‚Äôs a shame because I love every other aspect of this app. Being able to join clubs, share runs with your friends and join challenges makes running more interesting and fun. However, at the end of the day an accurate tracking system is what I‚Äôm looking for in an app like this.Strava used to be pretty good. It had everything it needed, but was lacking some features that would have made it great. There are relatively simple features that users have been requesting for many years, but they‚Äôre focused on things that annoy users, like making notifications more spammy and less useful, paid promotions for companies in the form of challenges that clog your feed, and all sorts of activities that are nice to track (privately) but annoying to sift through in a feed that can‚Äôt be filtered. Blech, not paying for this anymore.Been using strava for 5+ years and recently they are changing all the benefits of use to paid subscription users only...what‚Äôs the point of having the ‚Äúcommunity running group‚Äù with challenges if we can‚Äôt even use/see them anymore‚Äîwhy have segments, routes, etc...if we just have to pay for what made strava special. I have other fitness trackers but strava was different, now it‚Äôs just the same. üòïI have been riding with Strava for a few weeks now. I really enjoy the competition favor the challenges bring but when the top 7 are being completed by people with eBikes, it is super frustrating. There should be a separate leaderboard section for people who choose to ride eBikes. For your typical road bikers it become next to impossible to secure any placement above top 5.

When I first downloaded the app, I still had access to leaderboards and all that jazz, but since then Strava has thrown the subscription model at its users like so many others. ($60 a year is pretty wild if you ask me). Although I was bummed, I still enjoyed the challenges and still preferred the overall interface over Nike‚Äôs. However, over the past few months I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing an uptick in the amount of runs that don‚Äôt get tracked properly. I can‚Äôt tell you how frustrating it is to finish a long run, only to get back and look at Strava saying I‚Äôve only run 2.8 miles. Like what?? Sometimes the app won‚Äôt even track my movement at all during a run and I‚Äôll find myself on the sidewalk messing with my phone trying to close out of the app to reset it, and at times that doesn‚Äôt even fix the issue. I would rather not go back to using Nike‚Äôs app (for reasons I won‚Äôt go into), but at least their gps tracking system is solid. Strava if you see this, please address this issue. (Currently on iPhone X)i appreciate the data collected and the personal feedback.  i like the ability to socially engage with and encourage my friends and acquaintances regarding their activities.  i purchased a subscription to support the development & growth if the application, but lately my feed has been inundated with offers & adds disguised as clubs and challenges to join.  sometimes i‚Äôll scroll for quite a long time to get past all of this.  if i didn‚Äôt pay for a subscription, i‚Äôd accept it as the price of admission, but i DO pay.  
several of my friends pay for & use Ride With GPS, & i have to admit, certain features, like turn-by-turn instructions for routes (strava doesn‚Äôt seem to offer this), are attractive, especially considering the lack of adds.  
Rethink this decision for your paying supporters, Strava.Good lord, I mean this used to be my go to app, but I‚Äôm going to try out new ones now. It used to work flawlessly, then y‚Äôall took all kinds of options away, which I dealt with because it was still an awesome app. But now my workouts take forever to sync with my apple products, sporadically. Some sync right away and it‚Äôs great, others and it takes all night.

However there is zero support for triathletes which boggles my mind considering that ppl have been asking for this for a long time.

Almost impossible hitting sport specific challenges when your training for 3 different ones.I really love using the Strava app except it is not calculating my total miles walked. This makes it hard to do challenges and would be a threat motivation. I just see a big fat zero on the top of my profile.

I have to say that I joined when segment leaderboards were still all free, routes were free, and you got a year in review of your activities at the end of the year. This was great, made me love the app, but since then it has become an app that only lets you see top overall on a segment and men and women best times. It has also made it necessary to pay for the ability to use the number of routes freely created by other users and inputted into their database. And finally very recently they made the Year in Sport exclusive to subscribers. In the end it is just a Facebook for sharing activities and adding up numbers. Many other tracking apps have uh more available for free than Strava. Just know if you want to make sure you will always have access to something on the app, but the subscription. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they made the whole app only available by subscription.The Strava app has many of the same features as Nike+ and RunKeeper but has the added bonus of accessing groups, expanded challenges, and viewing others runs.  Where it lacks is the ability to view (what in my opinion is most valuable) routes while running or biking. For those of us that like to try new routes, viewing them on the Apple Watch would be invaluable. For instance, on a new trail run yesterday I got lost twice and had to pull out my phone to backtrack since I cannot view the route on my watch. I think adding this feature would make Strava hands-down the best app for running, biking, hiking, etc.  This app is otherwise just average for those that would like to step away from their phone or computer.I enjoy this app quite a bit! Easy to use and understand. Challenges are fun! One thing I would like to see is being able to change when your week starts for weekly progress! Strava is on Monday to Sunday week.

For example- why does my main page only give the option to display my run, bike, swim stats if I only use it for climb, ski, and hike?  It would make more sense to default to your most used 3. I don‚Äôt know anybody on the app whose main 3 are bike run swim, so there seems to be a disconnect.
 Also finding local routes seems pretty buggy, I‚Äôll get different routes every time I search somewhere, half of them missing, never any really long routes even though I know they‚Äôre there.
Wish it had better ui for climbing tracking, but it‚Äôs nice that so many other apps will plug into it.
Other than that, enjoyable community, challenges are cool, and overall more motivational to use than I anticipated.Strava is a great app to track your fitness and with a little more TLC can be amazing. Has accurate GPS and good integration with other apps. The challenges allow you to push yourself and set goals to achieve and compete with friends.

I transferred to Strava from Adidas Run app due to its integrations however there are a few things I miss that I wish Strava had.

1. Importing your GPSX data is a tedious and manual process that restricts you to 100 uploads a day, it took me 5 days to import all my runs from previous years

2. Using the Apple Watch app, the audio cues for runs do not emit to your headphones, you have to make sure your headphones are connected to both your phone and your watch if you are listening to music with your phone

3. Even though Apple Watch can track cadence the strava app does not, so it‚Äôs a missing dataset. There are hacks I‚Äôve found to work around this, but not without using a third party app.

4. One of the biggest things is custom trainings. You could set your own training sessions up so that you can do 30 second sprints and 1 min rest on repeat with audio cues. Instead I have to keep track of my miles or time to know when to do the next stage of my workout.

I would love if these were integrated and would make the app an incredible experience for training.Okay so this app rocks, I‚Äôve been getting more friends to use it and we all have a lot of fun with it. My only complaint is that I‚Äôm currently having an issue with the gps reliability. More often than not now, I‚Äôll start recording for a bike ride, and for the first mile or two, it won‚Äôt actually track me. So then when it eventually starts working, there‚Äôs just a straight diagonal line from where I start to where the Gps starts working properly. So I‚Äôm losing ride time, distance, and segment challenges. If they could fix this bug in an update soon, that would be very much appreciated.i thought this was just a problem with my internet or my run but i joined july 5K the day it started and i‚Äôve ran several 5K runs but they never register to the challenge. i deleted the app and logged out and the next day i ran another 5K and it didn‚Äôt register again, I‚Äôve left the challenge multiple times and nothing is changing, I don‚Äôt know if the people who run this app check the reviews but if you want that last star you better fix this problem for me, thank you. my name is julia kalinina if you‚Äôd like to check my runs and challenges :)I started running a few weeks ago and absolutely love this app to track my miles. I was excited to join the challenges to see how far I can push myself and meet new goals. However, given a condition I have in my hips and back I can only do low impact running indoors. I have to add each activity manually which I‚Äôve learned do not count towards challenges. I don‚Äôt know if it a glitch in the app or a choice Stravia is making but it was disappointing I couldn‚Äôt join the challenges. Otherwise this app is fantastic.I would like to see more challenges.

It‚Äôs been so helpful in training for short races, improving my times, encouraging friends with kudos, and keeping some competitive spirit. Functionality could use some improvements - e.g., ability to add videos instead of just still photos, ability to see heart rate data from Fitbit with the free app version, etc.

I also find it frustrating that the privacy settings are not consistent with the monthly race challenges- in the past I was able to save runs as ‚Äúfollowers only‚Äù and still have them count towards monthly distance challenges, but now runs have to be marked as ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù privacy in order to count for races/challenges, which I find frustrating- I should be allowed to maintain high standards of privacy for my own safety while also competing in challenges.Like the app and the compatibility with my iWatch! Would love to have my iWatch have the capability with this app to have it ding/vibrate every mile so that I could be more aware of my turn to move to the front when group riding. That and maybe being able to pull up my average speed during a ride on my iWatch instead of having to wait till the end of the ride to see what my average was. These things are not deal breakers for me but I would love to see them as improvements. Love the app! It‚Äôs awesome for keeping track of my rides with my cycling buddies. Love the segment challenges to keep competing against others and push myself. Love getting badges on segments. I only have two apps that I use for cycling and my iWatch and Strava is my go to app for cycling. ThanksI love Strava, but wish there was a way to share certain activities with groups I‚Äôm in without having to set my profile to share with everyone. Same goes for when I would like to enter certain challenges that require the organizer to be able to view activities. It‚Äôs a bummer to not have this option to engage more but while still maintain privacy from the general public for privacy and safety reasons. I imagine this issue likely impacts women or others wanting the safety of privacy more than other groups.I like using this app for tracking my workouts and routes for biking and running. I love the challenges. It‚Äôs a great motivator. I would like to recommend to the developers to put a search function on Strava to search my previous activities and that of my friends. It would be nice to even be able to search by month and year instead of having to continuously scroll to find a past activity. Overall this is a good app to use.Definitely one of my top rated workout apps. And will continue using. Could add a few more updates like dark mode and other sports. Would recommend strava just needs to get with the times a little bit on updates and be willing to change the overall look and add different challenges. I also think strava premium is kinda pointless yea you get some cool maps that nobody else gets but that‚Äôs really it.This is a really good running app with lots of monthly challenges you can participate in. I‚Äôve been using it for about 4 months and it‚Äôs definitely more accurate and faster than Map My Run which I was using before. 

My only complaint would be how much you pay for ‚Äúsummit.‚Äù They get you with bundling services and it‚Äôs not cheap. 

Other than that great app is you run consistently and have friends that do it‚Äôs the best imo.",0,crh7Works far awayon behalf of...Shantastic427Sososo1245667Alandfarfaraway,Super motivating for running/bikingMy go to cycle appLove it but would like more privacy and sharing alternativesGood app but areas for improvementStravaWould recommend,StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,0,6,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,613,has_challenges,53

But now everything is basically premium or nothing, something as basic as weekly mileage is not premium only, all that‚Äôs left is challenges, minor statistics, leaderboards, and the standard social aspect for posting and giving others kudos. Strava was never good at connecting people with the cycling community in their area and worse now that everything is premium only. Really considering deleting if it isn‚Äôt for my habit of using this to record. There‚Äôs really no point specially if you have a computer, I might as well use my personal device‚Äôs app. Strava is going to die up if this goes on.I wish there was a ‚ÄúWarm-Up‚Äù and ‚ÄúCool-Down‚Äù setting you could apply to each run/hike/walk/climb/cycle!

Id rather my feed be solely for the actual run itself, but if you make the warm-ups and cool-downs private, then they wont be applied to the monthly distance challenges! (I think? Right?

Incredibly powerful features ‚Äî like course mapping, integration with gps devices,  segment analysis and more ‚Äî that are much easier to use than most fitness apps. I also like that you can easily control privacy, whether you want to share information with everyone or just your network. There are several ways to track profess ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre wanting to see personal improvements or how you compare to groups or even everyone that‚Äôs ever participated on that same stretch of road. These include challenges, segment and trending analysis over time, and there are QOMs/KOMs. The latter compares your times to everyone, the former can be more personalized.I‚Äôve been using Strava for a while now and it has been very easy and comprehensive to use. I can accurately see how I am improving and how my friends are doing all while I‚Äôm on my bike, running, or taking a break from the water. It has really boosted my performance since I can use the challenges feature to push myself a little further each time I go. I also am able to go do activity with friends and invite them on events, which makes it easy to do group runs and rides, which is especially important on events in places like roads or far from any city. Overall I would highly recommend this if you swim, bike, run, or do all three.I have used and enjoyed other activity tracking apps. I, like many others, was introduced to Strava by a friend. I enjoy the social aspects, being encouraged by friends and in turn encouraging them. I enjoy having challenges to work toward. I love seeing how my runs compare to previous runs. I am glad that the developers keep trying to make the app better.

I tried premium but my training style is more casual so there was not as much value in it for me. A tiered subscription might be enticing for users who are not trying to be professional athletes. Plus my friends can already track me with other apps.The kudos are cool but even if you‚Äôre not totally into the social side of it, Strava helps you track your fitness and explore areas around you. Premium is worth it in having access to friendly competition in the segments and challenges and I get so much use out of the route builder, especially when traveling since it helps you see common paths the locals enjoy. Super easy integration for your fitness trackers and other apps, and the camaraderie and support you can find in the communities is like nowhere else!I have had Strava for about a year and a half now and let me say, it's amazing. The amount of features that you get without paying the subscription is outstanding. The app got even better for me when in January, I purchased an Apple Watch Series 4. It works seemlessly on my watch, tracking all my segments and such correctly. The app has motivated me with its challenges and social aspect to get out more and run/ride/hike etc. I have lost nearly 30lbs since the beginning of the year and Strava has certainly helped. Hope to see the app get even better with time.Strava has changed my life by helping me see the affect that different approaches to my athletic life . I have been a member since day one. I have logged over 50,000 miles on my bike and a ton of walks and hikes. They are all accessible. Plus now when I travel I can find where to ride! Awesome! Not to mention the challenges and social aspect. I stay in touch with friends in other countries through Strava. I love Strava!I‚Äôve been using Strava for years and have an excellent record of every workout, hike and long walk. They continue to add value with social (great for motivation and encouragement, especially the challenges), unique analysis (really cool to review the chart of my times for a given run, etc.) and ease of use. Try the free version if you like but then cough up a few bucks to keep it going.I‚Äôve started running and taking long 4-5 mile walks during quarantine. Having this app has been such a blessing because it tracks everything! Miles, pace, total time, and where I‚Äôve been. I also love the social aspect where I can join clubs and earn digital trophies for different challenges. I have the watch app as well and it works wonders! I‚Äôm a big fan and highly recommend!!Strava has revolutionized my fitness journey with its rich features and social aspect. Connecting with friends, joining challenges, and tracking progress in activities like running and cycling keeps me motivated. The app's detailed analytics and compatibility with various devices make it an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their fitness experience. Highly recommended!I have found this to be a great tool of tracking how I‚Äôm progressing with my daily activities and even training for any races.  Having various challenges have been my motivation to keep improving.  Great way to also connect with other people in various clubs or activities.  Happy to see athletes helping athletes attain their goals!I like connecting with friends and seeing what they did, where they ran and accomplished.  I like pushing myself to see if I can earn a new PR on a segment.  I value and utilize the data to see where I was a year ago and what challenges I can complete too.  But in the end, you have to remember not to compare yourself to other people.As someone trying to get back into running, at a more competitive and serious level, Strava has been a game changer. It has given me a community, challenges, and a very accurate way to track progress. Segments & PRs are so motivating! I recommend to all of my running friends & family. Thanks, Strava Team ‚ò∫Ô∏è Truly.Love this app , enjoy track my Miles and feet of climbing. Enjoy signing up for challenges each month. The only thing I don‚Äôt like now with a group of friends that you have ,you can‚Äôt always see everyone unless you click on them. Sort of like Facebook you lose connections with them.There are not that many life changing apps. Strava surely got me to run regularly and i just finished 3 half marathons in 3 weeks  and strava is the reason behind it. Strava has all these fun challenges that keeps me motivated and i can see my friends worksouts and gain inspiration from them also. Highly recommended app!1. Best-in-class
2. Privacy standards are above industry standard
3. Social component/challenges do not overwhelm the app‚Äôs core focus‚Äî tracking fitness/recreational activities
4. UX/UI is very easy to navigate
5. What‚Äôs next? Need to try Strava Premium to see how much more there is to offer.Thanks to Strava I have improved my time and endurance.  The monthly challenges keep me moving more often and become a commitment that helps me improve and keeps me motivated to keep going.  
It‚Äôs also a way to find other runners like me and others that I can learn from.Easy to use, accurate, fun challenges, stay in touch with friends...and race against their times. Only thing I would change would be to indicate hundredths of a mile, not just 2.1, for example...2.18mi like some other apps do.

Also, just did a ride from SF to Marin and it thinks I biked across the bay rather than the bridge...clearly didn't record any gps data or it was so sparse it drew a line between two points. 

Awful. Only reason I use this is because my historical data is there. Apple's own outdoor cycle activity tracking is way better.I have used Strava for years recording my outdoor open water swim activities from my iPhone using the Strava app. Have never had any problems with it until the last six months. 

Now my moving times are being recorded/calculated wrong and the overall time and 100yd time are messed up. 

If I switch the activity type to a different sport it shows all the correct time and distance so it is recording it all. It‚Äôs something wrong with how the swim activity uses the gps data points to calculate everything

The rest of the times I tap ‚Äòsave‚Äô after I ‚Äòfinished and they disappear forever. No recorded information to be restored. Ever. I also don‚Äôt like that you can not record specific water sports (like kayaking, swimming, windsurfing) without having your phone on you. For me this defeats the purpose of using the watch app. These sports seem to be ones you would very likely rather leave your phone behind. If you begin an activity in your phone (not the watch) it does not communicate with the watch and gayer any heart rate information, which for me is the primary reason I bought the app to begin with. And finally, when you do receive recorded analysis of a workout you can‚Äôt go in and pinpoint exact moments on a graph of your heart rate information, it would be nice to have a chart that you can scroll the exact plot points. It could be good, but as it stands I won‚Äôt be renewing.For a leading app this has got to have the shoddiest development team of all.

The iOS 12 beta was out for over 2 months ago, am i to believe that none of these issues were present in testing?

For example, yesterday‚Äôs little neighborhood ride of 15.2 miles initially appeared in Apple Health as being 10.2 miles, which is probably where I paused for a long telephone conversation. Today, that same ride shows up in the Health App as being approximately 13.1 miles, and Apple shows it segmented hour by hour.
One day earlier, a 9 mile climb of 1650 feet, followed by a short pause, then a 1.5 mile cruise along the shore of the alpine reservoir, then another pause at the end of the pavement to share our trophies (delicious cookies), then a downhill rush ended up segmented into 3 adjacent hours with the total distance recorded in Apple Health about 1.5 miles less than recorded by Strava. Strava‚Äôs data source for this information is NOT the Apple Phone‚Äôs or Apple watch‚Äôs GPS (I wear each), but my Garmin Edge 1030, which exports to the Strava app on my Apple iOS and macOS devices.

Two things I would love to improve.
   One - precision. When people run, they rarely zigzag manically from one side to the other speeding up to an equine sprint, stopping and changing directions. It should be easy to figure out that a gps location keeps getting skewed by reflections from buildings or terrain and ignore those errant points, smooth out the path so it‚Äôs at least within the confines of the street. When this goes astray, the distance increases drastically and the speed gets miscalculated.
   Also, some places have bridges. Bridges and viaducts can go over lower terrain. It can‚Äôt be difficult to figure out that a runner is not traversing the surface of a river like a modern day Jesus Christ, but is going over a bridge and count elevation accordingly. If Jesus does come again and his walking across a body of water is incorrectly accounted for on Strava, he will forgive you. That‚Äôs kinda his thing. Short of that, why not figure out where bridges are and get the heights of their spans into the system.

It doesn‚Äôt either allow you to correct your distance ran in your activity. I really don‚Äôt recommend this app.

Also if a user wants to create a course or a segment, it requires to subscribe first which basically means having to pay for subscription. No reason to do so because other apps let you do it for free. This app doesn‚Äôt either have hot badges or levels to reach based on miles accumulated, which is a motivational factor for runners.

Any documentation is years old and irrelevant, customer service takes it‚Äôs sweet time. None of the subscription features have ever worked except for the route maker. Despite rigorous trackable daily exercise over months, the app still indicates no weekly intensity. If the purpose of the Strava app is to combine data from multiple sources, it‚Äôs a total failure. To use Strava to ride, you can‚Äôt also manually activate the Fitbit or you‚Äôll get 2 records-If you use only Strava app, you get no Fitbit activity credit-If you use Fitbit only, you can‚Äôt use the Strava route tracker. With my Smart Rower, the app still fails to pull in the heart rate data from my Fitbit. There is nothing this app does that the other free apps (Fitbit, SmartRower) don‚Äôt already do. I‚Äôm no longer sure what the point of this app is besides ripping me off. Also, I have communicated with feedback and I have not heard an answer-as of this post it was 14 days ago. Bu-bye Strava, you‚Äôre off to the land of deleted apps that failed to live up to their advertised expectations.Strava‚Äôs Apple Watch integration remains terrible and they‚Äôve done nothing to improve it for more than a year. When you start an activity on the Strava app it loses heart rate data and you can‚Äôt see it on your watch. When you start an activity on your watch you lose out on audio queues and beacon and you can‚Äôt see it on your phone. So for cyclists with a phone mounted on their bike they are left with a terrible choice. A) no recorded heart rate data on the activity and feedback on their phone or B) heart rate data recorded but a black phone screen for the whole ride. No other running or biking app does it this way. It‚Äôs mind boggling that Strava is the only company in the space that doesn‚Äôt offer this functionality. Worse, there‚Äôs Strava forum posts with thousands of comments related to this issue and no reply from anyone at Strava. They‚Äôve completely abandoned their Apple Watch users. I‚Äôve cancelled my Strava premium plan over this issue.I started looking into Strava when I started competitively mountain biking, and was extremely disappointed when I installed the app. I was first able to sign in through my email, which went smooth but as soon as the set up was finished I was continuously getting error and try again messages when trying to navigate the app. After fiddling around for way too long trying to get it to work I decided to delete the app and try again. And to my surprise I was not even able to sign in nor was I able to create a new account through my Email, my Google, my Apple ID or anything else which had left me here looking for answers and possibly a different app. Overall I am extremely disappointed.I‚Äôve been using Nike run, but decided to give Strava a try after a few friends recommended it. I wanted to like it, but it‚Äôs been disappointing. 

I‚Äôve recorded four runs, and the app recorded each one incorrectly in terms of both time and distance. For example, on one run, my first mile is recorded at +19min while the next is <4min. On a separate run, the app didn‚Äôt record the time at all. To give more context, I ran the same familiar each time, but the app recorded different overall distances for each run. I tried trouble shooting the issue in the app with the feedback function, but the issues haven‚Äôt been resolved, and I have not been able to get in contact with anyone from Strava. 

In short, I do not recommend this app.If you are looking for politics to be inserted into your running, biking & swimming, üëçLOOK NO FUTHER! It used to be that sports was the one place where we could be united because of our passion for them & they are fantastic to escape the world‚Äôs woes, if only for a little while. It seems that Strava does not feel the same way; they would prefer divisive content on an app used for simply tracking fitness. Furthermore, it is disingenuous to excuse 6 months of continuously rioting and burning down American cities (including Washington DC) by one group as ‚Äúpeaceful protests.‚ÄùGot into using strava earlier this year, liked the functionality so I got the paid version/subscription. Overall their improvements have been great, EXCEPT the ‚Äúsuggested athletes to follow‚Äù. Many paid members including myself have asked Strava to give option to disable. After looking over the strava forums, it seems that‚Äôs Strava doesn‚Äôt care about feedback it receives. I even contact support multiple times. This eventually led me to cancel my subscription, if I‚Äôm having to deal with a nuisance than I‚Äôll settle for the free version,.The maps are grossly outdated and rely on feedback to ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù and they ‚Äúmight‚Äù get updated at some point. As a user of many different areas, I don‚Äôt have time to send updates on all the areas. They need to go out and source more updated maps instead of relying on users to do this for free. I can see user updates as a use case for minor updates but when the maps show undeveloped land that have been developed for 5+ years‚Ä¶that is a problem.Every time I run with this, regardless of where or how long, it gets my times wrong. They‚Äôre correct during the run (the verbal feedback), but once they‚Äôre uploaded to the phone, they‚Äôre wrong. And I don‚Äôt mean the annoying problem where you have to manually set each run to a race so it doesn‚Äôt count stops. I mean, I thinks I‚Äôm running 2 minute kilometers, which is just wrong. I‚Äôve tried submitting errors repeatedly, but it‚Äôs still wrong.

Contrast that with MapMyFitness, which gives you seven options and eight interval choices at either distances or times. What about coaching? Forget it. Paying for premium is a total ripoff. There isn't even a delayed start option. Maybe the social media aspect is more appealing to some people, but UA has that covered too.

It seems like such an easy thing to do since they have added activities in the past few years like SUP, Crossfit, and Kayaking. It‚Äôs not a huge ask, but we‚Äôve been ignored for years.

That means I have to disable autopause if I‚Äôm tracking a hike or run/walk/run type training, so I‚Äôm always having to go back into the settings and switch it back and forth. I‚Äôve lost tracking on parts of my routes because of this.
I don‚Äôt understand why autopause isn‚Äôt sensitive enough to track walking/stopping.  Other apps seem to handle this just fine.
Units and splits: why does the display only show tenths of miles and not hundredths?  Maybe since this started as a biking app, 1/10 of a mile made sense, but as a runner I think more in terms of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 mile distances for pace training.  I am unable to do this on strava because it doesn‚Äôt display the data (that it is already gathering), and because there is no way to select a different option for audio feedback frequency (like every 1/4 mile).
So, there are many things to like about the app, but the bottom line is that it has limited usefulness and versatility for training.i appreciate the data collected and the personal feedback.  i like the ability to socially engage with and encourage my friends and acquaintances regarding their activities.  i purchased a subscription to support the development & growth if the application, but lately my feed has been inundated with offers & adds disguised as clubs and challenges to join.  sometimes i‚Äôll scroll for quite a long time to get past all of this.  if i didn‚Äôt pay for a subscription, i‚Äôd accept it as the price of admission, but i DO pay.  
several of my friends pay for & use Ride With GPS, & i have to admit, certain features, like turn-by-turn instructions for routes (strava doesn‚Äôt seem to offer this), are attractive, especially considering the lack of adds.  
Rethink this decision for your paying supporters, Strava.I have been loving strava. However, the suggested routes for running are not ideal routes AT ALL. They take you on mostly main roads with no shoulders or sidewalks. I haven‚Äôt been able to use this function at all because of this issue. I know these aren‚Äôt user data sourced either, because I never see people running on these roads-because they are dangerous! Strava, use the data you already have of where people run to make legitimate suggestions. It‚Äôs also not hard to pull data from Google about traffic patterns. There‚Äôs no reason this can‚Äôt be a good feature. I‚Äôve used feedback suggestions many months ago for all of these dangerous suggested routes, and nothing has changed.Have used this to track my runs for two years now and loved it!  Especially with the audio cues I got through my Bluetooth headphones.  I was massively disappointed then when I recently bought an Apple Watch to help track my heart rate and learned that strava doesn‚Äôt play audio cues through Bluetooth headphones while using the app through the Apple Watch.  So I essentially have to choose whether to use the app through the phone and get audio cues and sacrifice heart rate feedback, or through the Apple Watch and get heart rate but sacrifice audio cues.   Till this is fixed, this is a 3 star app for me.It would be nice if the app allowed for activity tracking in increments of .00 instead of .0. I left some feedback for the devs about this a while ago, but didn‚Äôt see any update. Other than that, this app is more reliable than the Nike app. But I may go back to it because at least on there the miles are tracked more accurately.Love the app, but the GPS connection to Apple Watch is too spotty to truly trust when training. Rarely does it actually pickup the starting location so on a run the first half might be a straight line. You‚Äôll never be able to calculate your true stats.

The app gives you direct voice feedback while your in the midst of the activity. Probably the only feature I would add at this point would be a reminder of sun rise or sun set for those on long bike trails. In addition, maybe it could potentially have a connection to weather channel  if there is a unscheduled weather pattern changes I.e. severe thunder storms and lighting, etc.While so many apps I've tried boast about the bells and whistles they've been able to incorporate, Strava has taken a more less is more approach. They track runs accurately, analyze data and provide helpful feedback. While my NikePlus friends list was longer, my real life engagement with the few Strava followers is far more meaningful and beneficial to my running goals. I'd categorize Strava as an app for real runners. Skip the frills and just run.

I uploaded all my workouts for the last month and then went into my dashboard excited to get started using the other features. I saw that every one of my workouts included a highlighted map of my route and where I‚Äôd been. I attempted to hide this only to find out through researching it that there is no way to do so completely. I can hide it from my dashboard by selecting ‚Äútreadmill‚Äù but it still shows up in other areas of my profile. I am not the first person to be concerned with this feature. There are concerns stated in the help section with a response from Strava that this issue would be addressed in 2018! Obviously this issue has not been resolved. It is a major safety concern when people you do not know on a social media app can see exactly what routes you use to workout every day. I could set my activity to private but that kind of defeats the purpose for me to connect with others. Unfortunately because of this I cannot use this app until it is resolved. I hope they actually address this soon like they stated they would two years ago because I would love to use this app to connect with others and log my workouts.I guess if one is looking to be part of a training community, and doesn't mind sharing lots of private information such as location and data with others and tech companies, Strava must be great. I was ready to subscribe to this app for one reason: to be able to sort and see data as I want to see given how limited both Apple and Garmin apps are for seeing such data as total steps in time frames of my choosing. I am very concerned about data collection and HATE notifications. To disable notifications, it seemed like I had to uncheck at least 20 boxes. I never felt as if my personal information was truly safe from Strava, which would have been helped if not forced into being part of a social network. The experience with Strava felt like more work than one of my intense workouts. This was very disappointing. I used the app for only a little over a week of the free one month trial before deleting my account and the app.I have used Strava for years and really liked the social aspect of it but they have been slowly deleting features or moving them from free to paid versions. I don‚Äôt expect you offer most premium product for free but rolling out features in the free version and then later moving it to the paid product is irritating. Especially when some of those features are not particularly premium. Want to compare your most recent jog around the neighborhood to prior ones? Cough up $60 a year! What!? I don‚Äôt need all the training plans and stuff of the paid version. Maybe you could have more than 1 paid tier? I could go on and on, like how they ruined the Apple Watch app, took away BT HR sensors etc. The latest outrage for me is they announce to great fanfare they bought back BT HR sensors, huzzah! Except it doesn‚Äôt work.  This feature worked totally fine when you removed it a while ago and now you re-introduce a non-functioning feature? Ugh, you guys are killing me. Why do I keep using this?!I really wanted to try Strava for the social aspect. I don‚Äôt need crazy metrics for my runs and thought it would be fine. I even have a trial of the premium sub right now. This has the worst UI of any app I‚Äôve tried (and I‚Äôve tried all of them). Everything glitches, or is kept on the website, or is hard to find in the app, or is pointless. I keep having to google ‚Äúhow to do X in Strava‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt Strava doing Y.‚Äù It auto-pauses and never resumes on runs, it doesn‚Äôt record calories despite knowing my weight, almost none of the interface is intuitive. You can‚Äôt track shoe mileage, you can‚Äôt import more than the past 30 days of Apple health data, the advertised training plans are kept locked up on their horrible website and aren‚Äôt even useful plans. It‚Äôs just all so bad I cannot believe that they would CHARGE for this! Strava you‚Äôve at least got to get your $h!+ together before you transition the business model to paid.I used premium for a month with a free trial and liked some of the features enough that I decided to subscribe. For some reason a week after getting charged all the premium features dropped off my app, despite it still saying I‚Äôm a premium subscriber. None of the suggested solutions on the support website worked, so I submitted a ticket. 

They got my hopes up by responding fairly quickly with a request for my payment receipt, but after sending that over I‚Äôve gotten no response for days. 

Aside from the robust community on Strava, the basic features are pretty much the same you‚Äôll get from any free app, so if you‚Äôre into the social aspect then basic Strava is probably a good pick for you. I‚Äôd be wary of giving them your money, however, as it looks like their customer support is notoriously bad, and there‚Äôs a chance you won‚Äôt even get the features you paid for.I have heard it stated that Strava doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be.  Is it a training platform app or a social media app?  I think it‚Äôs trying to be both and there are some drawbacks to not having a rooted identity.

In some ways the above is most likely at play when it comes to the virtue signaling going on with the company as well.  In June of 2023 Strava decided to promote a non-athletic cross dresser to promote their woke ideology.  This ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù stated that they did not enjoy the sport of running or endurance but reluctantly promotes Strava.  Huh?!

I just cannot support companies that are this out of touch, relative to their customer base anymore.  Why not promote an athlete or an aspiring one?  All in the name of ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù but you are choosing to ignore, and in my case exclude, those that were on the app to socialize while training and had no need to shout their sexual identity from the rooftops.I have loved Strava for a long time but now they are doing away with Bluetooth connectivity in the app for heart rate monitors and power meters. They say it is because the app crashes, why not just fix the problem? Without the connection strava will require you to use a third party if you would like to upload your data, my question now is what is the point of strava if I need to use a third party app to get data? One of the major things strava peaks offers is data based on heart rate meaning it will measure the HR and assign a number value for how hard you worked on a given workout, but with out HR connection this is a useless feature. There certainly is no reason to pay for strava (I am canceling my strava peaks) and I can‚Äôt find a reason to use the free version when the third party app will provide me the data I need with the connectivity. Strava was great but now seams completely irrelevant.‚ÄúNARP‚Äù: non-athletic regular person.

After using the app as a paid subscriber for well over a year now, I have learned that Strava is not even close to what it is hyped up to be. The amount of technology errors is absolutely unacceptable and the quality of updates only proceeds to go downhill. It is beyond apparent that Strava is a company with below average programmers, none of whom actually use the app themselves. Ie. I have not met a single person that has runs upload regularly without a hitch- and I just recorded a ride directly to my phone that didn‚Äôt upload. How does that even happen when it has internet connection the entire route?

Moral of the story: dozens of easy to fix errors that persist while paywalls go up and no new features roll out. You have to wonder what the programmers are doing with the exorbitant price I pay for this app.I love the social element of Strava and the ability to keep track of my workouts... however they have slowly been removing features available through the free version. I don‚Äôt need or want all of the fancy analyses of my workout- but cmon, Strava, I can‚Äôt even see how many miles I‚Äôve run each week anymore? I‚Äôm sure there are thousands just like me who have no interest (or $$) for the paid version and don‚Äôt care to have all the fancy features... but now we can‚Äôt even perform simple functions. Very disappointed - however I will now be keeping my weekly mileage written by hand rather than giving into this money trap. My suggestion is to look at other apps such as MapMyRun before getting stuck on Strava - you can do less than they promise.There is only one requirement I have for this app - ACTIVITIES FROM A CONNECTED DEVICE SHOULD UPLOAD EASILY. Instead, my Apple watch taunts me with ""to sync this activity make sure your Apple watch is connected to the network"" and the sync button does nothing but return me to the previous screen. Which network, Strava? My four bar 5g connection? Or my 200mb home wifi?  Because I'm connected to both right now and my activities still won't sync. Worse yet, your troubleshooting boils down to ""restart your phone and watch, if that doesn't work too bad"".   If you aren't able to make the most basic part of your product work consistently, you don't deserve my or anyone else's money. I've been using Strava for nearly ten years but it's time to move on.For us non subscribers, the features Strava keeps taking away, have made this app worthless in terms of being a social site. All this app can do (unless you pay for it) is track your daily times and show you how far behind from the top ten you are. And it doesn‚Äôt even do that accurately when compared to other gps apps. I was tempted to pay because I missed the leaderboards. But after this latest low blow to get more subscribers I‚Äôve become more determined to find a new app. The social aspect was the only thing keeping me with Strava as I am not a professional, I‚Äôm not training for anything, and I can‚Äôt even ride all year long in my state.  So disappointed in how the executives have decided to run Strava. Who are you taking advice from? A teenager?Fails to accurately record calories.  Doesn‚Äôt read weight, height, or other data from Apple Health.  I had to go to their website (!?) and log in to even input my weight at all in order to get it to say anything other than 0 calories.  Doesn‚Äôt accurately record data to Apple Health either!  Creates duplicate or triplicate entries of each data field in Apple Health every time I run / hike / etc.  I have to manually delete these duplicates otherwise my daily metrics (which are used by other apps) are all screwed up.

So it‚Äôs not really an effective fitness app.  For mapping purposes, Gaia GPS is far superior.  I suppose some people might like the social aspect here, but that‚Äôs of almost no interest to me.

It has nice visual design, which is a plus for any app.  But without key functionality, that doesn‚Äôt count for much.I have enjoyed Strava for a few years and I‚Äôve even used premium (now summit) for a while. I stopped using summit due to the free app being so good. I really haven‚Äôt missed much in the premium feature set. I can understand taking away segments, matched runs and even the social aspects of the app to free members. I‚Äôm not okay with Strava charging me to have access to my own training log. I joined Strava to track my running electronically and to have a consistent place to keep my data whether I run with a Garmin, Suunto, Polar, Coros or something else. I won‚Äôt pay to access the data that I‚Äôve provided to Strava. I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere unless the training log becomes free again. Suunto‚Äôs app is terrible but at least they don‚Äôt charge me to look at MY data.I‚Äôve been using strava for a while as it was mandatory as part of a team I‚Äôm on. If it weren‚Äôt mandatory I would stick to Nike Run. Entry for runs and workouts is extremely manual and doesn‚Äôt track changes in speed or intervals unless you use the app to run (which is not ideal). I was excited that they offer API connections with things like Mindbody so that it would cut back on how often I had to manually enter workouts. That is until I realized I had to reset the API connection every time I wanted it to pull in data. And then the API connection broke the entire app on my iPhone and it‚Äôs unusable now. I get an error every time I open it. Thankfully now I don‚Äôt have to track in Strava anymore and can keep my data consistent in Nike and Volt (which offers AI learning and actual programming).Update 5/8/19: They have now broken the social aspect of the app. Now, they‚Äôll bunch up several trips taken over the last few weeks by the acquaintance you follow back out of social obligation, and place them above those of your friends who you know just finished riding. No option to return to chronological order, even temporarily.

Original post: I use this app almost exclusively for bicycle riding, and it has a lot of great functions, including keeping up with friends and clubs.

The most frustrating part of this app is how difficult it can be to find its most useful menus. If you want to set options for all your rides, keeping the screen from going to sleep, letting you know when it's pausing, etc., you have to set those options within a menu for a particular ride. How does that layout suggest that this setting will be applied to future rides? I was lucky to find them in the first place.

It's a little frustrating how much the app depends on the website for certain features, and that stuff should also be emphasized while using the app, because there's a lot more to unlock at the site.Sad to see the Strava team get greedy during the pandemic. When COVID-19 caused many people to lose their jobs and outlets for exercise, Strava started to become more popular (because people started using their app to plan exercise outdoors). Instead of reducing prices like many other companies are doing in the wake of the pandemic, Strava chose to switch many of their free services to be exclusive subscription services. You can no longer plan any route without paying for a subscription. This app has always been very glitchy but was starting to be a helpful resource to build community during social distancing efforts. Bummed that the Strava leadership is making decisions to profit financially instead of serve their communities.At the end of the day, Strava is unreliable and poorly supported. However, it also lacks features that set it apart from other similar apps and is overly reliant on social media features that have significant and disturbing privacy implications. The app loses data on a regular basis, especially for activities completed without cellular or WiFi service. Reaching out to support offers nothing more than a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting to it‚Äù email every two days that ultimately is repeated for weeks upon weeks. 

For serious athletes, Strava has become a bit of a running a joke; An example of something that was once excellent but has been picked and parted into something that‚Äôs barely useful for anything other than getting stalked.There are two incredibly annoying and obvious flaws I‚Äôve noticed. The first is one is not given the decision to activate the social media aspects it is automatically activated. This was incredibly annoying as I had no plan to post my runs but it was done anyway.

The second, and this one is far worse, is the runs themselves do not save without data. The past few days I have lost internet service at the end of my run and when I hit save the run was just gone forever. Would it be that complicated to have the run save on the app until service is acquired?

 I will be deleting this app and using a competitors which will likely not have such glaring and fixable bugs.Update: currently on v13.0 and going strong. Every time strava updates their app they increase the version number from8.0 to 9.0 etc. must be the new trend.   I only have great things to say. Keep up the good work!

V4.6.0 makes the live segments voice sound like Diane Rehm from NPR, it's hilarious. 

I talked to someone the other day that said they were using the Nike app. I said why, have you heard of strava?  Paid athletes use Nike. Real athletes and casual people that just want to see real stats use strava. 

Then, if you want you can get into the whole social piece of the app and the doors fly wide open. Beat my time from last spring?  Beat my buddies time up that crazy climb. Oh what was my HR on that time trial compared to last time?

You have it all with very regular updates, bug patches and new features!

Go ahead and waste your time with map my ride, Nike, etc.  I have been there. This has it all and get your friends onboard and let the fun begin.The Strava concept and database is very powerful and very handy if you like to keep track of your workouts and be social about it. But the Strava website is not a very well written one, with many interface issues that make it difficult or impossible to do specific things.

The iPhone app is not any better. In fact it‚Äôs much worse. The crash is often, and it lacks lots of functionality that, for some reason, seems like it would be very easy to add in. It leads me to believe that the portable device audience is just not very important to Strava.I paid for a full years subscription and for the first couple rides, the gps worked fine. But now it is trash. I‚Äôm on the most up to date version of the app and on the most current Verizon of iOS but my rides never record. I ride the same route multiple times per week and never have an issue with my watch‚Äôs built in tracking. I‚Äôve reached out to their support teams on social media and via email and no one responds. I learned my lesson‚Äîsave yourself the hassle and find a better tracker.Strava used to be a good ‚Äúsport social network‚Äù. But the company greedy ness and unwillingness to fix the app makes for a very, very poor experience.
Never implemented the ability to add/edit segments on the app. Never implemented the ability of add/edit gears (shoes/bikes) on the app.
They already took away the integration with Relive, which was what ‚Äútranslated‚Äù the boring stats of our rides to a nice video so other people could understand and actually feel like joining in.
They also removed the ability to use BT/ANT+ sensors with the app, claiming it was causing crashes (how about fix the app then?!?).
Now we lose proper access to the segment leaderboards. 
What‚Äôs the point of having all the ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù aspect that make people want to use the app in the first place, if it‚Äôs behind a paywall? Might as well go full paid service! At least it will be honest, stating that you don‚Äôt care with the core community, just with the money....Nowadays, I get a very intrusive all screen ad for their subscription multiple times a day. That's in addition to all the ads in the feed for Summit. 
It's just extremely annoying, especially because the subscription is quite useless. 
The app is bare bones. Simple things like adding  new shoes need to be done on the website.
If you can't build your platform features in an app in 2019, you're just a bad company. 
The only updates they release are for removing features from the app, most recently connection to sensors because they can't be bothered to make them workHere‚Äôs a suggestion. If you people to upgrade to premium, let the free version to work for the basic stuff... like uploading exercise. I ran over 3 miles (3.2) but you app rated it at just at a 3 mile run. Then, to add insult to injury, it won‚Äôt sync. I have tried 5 times. 5 times. Tried turning off my phone and restarting, swiped it and here‚Äôs what it keeps saying: ‚ÄúPlease you data connection.‚Äù What the heck does that mean? I am connected to WiFi. It keeps saying it. So... I‚Äôm just going to use my Apple Watch fitness and Nike Run Club. Using Strava is a waste of time. Do not buy their premium...As the title says I do not understand the love for this crap, sorry ‚Äúapp‚Äù. Over the years I have used MapMyFitness and Wahoo Fitness and they both blow this out of the water. That said they both have their issues, specifically Wahoo won‚Äôt let me use an Apple Watch has a heart rate monitor. This is a real shame because Wahoo is the only app I have used that calculates calories by factoring your heart rate. Speaking of calories Strava doesn‚Äôt even display calorie burn! I can only assume that the people who truly loves Strava are people who haven‚Äôt used anything else, or are merely in it for the social aspect.This app has bugs and it doesn‚Äôt always track your movements accurately. It makes a long line in places where it looses gps connection. Tired of the issues I got the SportsTracker app and I like it a bunch more than Strava. 

Tried to unsubscribe from the monthly payments but the ‚Äúcancel subscription‚Äù button is not available on IOS. I have screenshots of this and so far I sent an email about the issue to Strava and have not heard back. 

I will not recommend this app to anyone but the SportsTracker app is very good.Strava has been dealing with spam issues lately. As a result, they are limiting the number of comments you can make within a 24 hour period. You will get an error message on the mobile app, telling you that the ‚ÄòRate Limit‚Äô has been exceeded. Myself and several friends have experienced this when commenting on big events. This appears to be triggered after about 10 or so comments. 
This has been extremely frustrating given that this is a social platform and I am paying $59 per year as a premium subscriber!I have used Strava for many years. I have always enjoyed the extra perks of their paid subscription. In the last few updates, they have closed off many features to free accounts which ruins the fun of the social competitive aspect. At the same time, they increased the price to $80 a year. Double what it was when I started. I didn‚Äôt receive a notice of the increase until it was charged. Not worth it anymore. I‚Äôve canceled after many years of fun.This is a social media app with some fitness metrics. Overall the app is great for tracking and sharing fitness activities. However, it is NOT worth the large price increase for a subscription to a social media app to share you activities. My Garmin and Apple Health do it for free and provide WAY more insight into my workouts. Save your money and time, use the free version if you want to share, use something else to track fitness metrics.",0,Wonderland@@SendingOutAnSOSDJWahoo96BaileyLB13555shasha555No longer a paying customerriverman11nik b55mandyasalwaysFranko jonesswamslaDerek W.S.BrokeEven13clarehatesthisGaretttttMichael SeacatJustin75533gray_rVelvetmidgetspdorseyNyunickRhobsonParky1101JTHowie7ColoradoPhotogDrobsMcKnobbsELRexStevoBagzDispointedRunner,"Heard the app was great but...very disappointing... the Facebook of activity appsGoing BackwardsI really wanted to love it!Paid for features I‚Äôm not getting and support doesn‚Äôt respondApp itself is the okay but had to cancel paid subscription due to woke agendaNo Bluetooth connectionBelow Average Tech Made By NARPsUpset with changes to the app. Big failure.Long time user who will not be renewing.Not social anymoreNearly uselessReview for the new updateFull of Bugs, super manual entryGood app whose menus could be betterStrava got greedy when their users needed them mostUnreliable, poor supportClear design flawsThey dropped Bluetooth HR support.

It took over 2 months to get a response on a support ticket I placed - and that was after having to replace the ticket because they closed the first one without even working it. 

I get plenty of use out of the app but I‚Äôve paid significantly less for apps that work better. The app is glitchy when actually trying to record workouts. I hardly actually use the app anymore due to this and have had to purchase accessories from Garmin and Wahoo to get accurate workout recordings that just upload to Strava. I guess its nice to have all my workouts & photos in one place.

They shifted around the UX recently for training goals and it‚Äôs just never been the same after that. I like the data visualizations but it‚Äôs really after quantity which isn‚Äôt always the best indicator. It‚Äôs still a pretty immature training plan and there are better ones out there. This is really just becoming social media for athletes.On your press release you say that this charge is you putting all of your faith in your customers buying your service when your service is nothing without any of data provided by anyone who uploads freely theirs and keep a record for their own reasons. Why don‚Äôt you STRAVA put your thoughts into selling to companies and make this ADVERTISING BASED to cash your earnings. From all my colleagues, friends, friends of a friend and athlete‚Äôs that I‚Äôve ran into by still social distancing, they all said are not buying and or finding something else to study or just look at what they has just did. That being a minute or a mile or a single km or a 200 km‚Äôs. And just like the review I just read before this... really in the middle of a pandemic, unemployment and chaos worldwide? That‚Äôs not so smart. You can bet all your earnings that if you don‚Äôt either bring back like it was before this premium price or you sell this Strava company... it will be still here but at a declining rate of paid subscribers.Strava is a pretty good app but it really took a huge step backwards by eliminating Bluetooth sensor connections. You used to be able to connect a heart rate sensor or any other sensor directly through Strava and the data would feed into your activity (after paying for Premium).  
  This is no longer possible. Now you have to use another app to record sensor data (I use Wahoo) and then upload it to Strava. One catch is if you want to send a tracking Beacon (after paying Premium) you have have Strava and Wahoo open. Why do I have to use two apps to accomplish what one app used to do? 
  When I finish a ride I have to upload my Wahoo ride to Strava and then delete my Strava ride (or else it will double count your activity) then I have to edit the Wahoo ride. 
  Now I have multiple more steps just to record a ride. 
  So this basically ruined a good app. Strava please fix this and stop taking things away and saying the app is better!I have heard so much about Strava over the years, but was reluctant to add it bc I already track my runs so many ways - MapMyRun to share with friends, Nike+ Run Club for my lifetime running totals, achievements, and coached runs, and Garmin watch. I added Strava bc a virtual race I‚Äôm doing requires it and I thought I‚Äôd try it for a month of regular use with the free subscription. While I like the social aspects of this and the training data (still trying to learn what it all means!), there are several disappointing aspects that I can‚Äôt get past:
 - can‚Äôt use help/support feature in app (it repeatedly tells me to first confirm my email, I do, nothing changes)
 - can‚Äôt edit a run
 - can‚Äôt add shoes from the app, and can‚Äôt start shoes from the number of miles they already have
 - the training plan feature is absolutely bare bones. There is zero customization and no option for coached runs (fartlek, anyone?)
 - GPS tracking is wildly discrepant from my Garmin watch, which I‚Äôve used for years. Adds anywhere from .15-.2 mi extra distance on runs from 3-5mi in length. That‚Äôs a huge difference. It makes me look like I‚Äôm much faster than I am, but it gives me false PRs. Not cool, Strava. 

Bottom line for me: MMR and NRC do these things better and most of them for free. NRC is definitely the best value, even if Nike is constantly trying to sell me stuff.iPad: no app, unfortunate, could be used for the social networking planning aspect of fitness instead of having to constantly hold up a phone.

Apple Watch: don‚Äôt use the Apple Watch app. It‚Äôs a step backwards from the iOS/watch app built in. 1‚≠êÔ∏è iOS application does what it needs to do for connecting with other people using the application, to view social profiles, etc. although it‚Äôs quite painful to have to import Apple Watch-based activities. Also, given the outage I had the other day, those activities are at risk. 

 The Strava app on the Apple Watch is absolutely useless and doesn‚Äôt give as much data as the built-in application, so why use it? Why do I lose data about splits just because I‚Äôm using the strava app on my Apple Watch? If anything, a third-party app should give me more. Meanwhile, my workouts on my Mi band 6 seem to import automatically. So, quite weird.You want to track your mileage and get an idea of your speed and compare with friends? Awesome. This is for you!

Do you know what your FTP is? Your power zones? Your heart rate zones? Do you want to know how these evolve over time and see the impact that they make on your fitness? Yes? NOT FOR YOU. Strava has a major flaw in that any changes to your fitness measures will rewrite your entire history on the platform. So if your FTP goes up to 300 and you update it, Strava thinks you've always had 300 and will update all your old rides as if that were the case  this makes their Premium Fitness & Freshness feature completely useless. Strava even acknowledges this bug and seemingly has no interest at all in fixing it. What this tells me is that they aren't REALLY interested in being an excellent fitness app. They're interested in being a social app and accruing paying customers.I wanted to like this app because of the social feature but my data is always off. I run marked trails so I know my mileage and the Strava app always shows my mileage as 0.1-0.2 miles fewer than what I have actually run. That doesn‚Äôt seem like much but it consistently does it and there is no way to adjust the mileage. I have tried to wait a couple minutes to let the app acquire a good GPS signal as suggested but this hasn‚Äôt made any difference. I also began using the indoor run selection on my Apple Watch and it does the same thing. This makes my mile average a good 20-30 seconds per mile longer than it actually is. I have used other running apps (Runtastic is my favorite) and don‚Äôt have any problems with them. I wish Strava would fix these issuesI have been a Strava premium member for several years, and I have loved all that it offers. It had everything I wanted and worked great. Recently, however, Strava removed Bluetooth compatibility with the app making it useless for tracking activities if you want to use HR monitor, cadence monitor, etc. You now have to use a separate app and import into Strava to use its analytics and social aspect. This is unacceptable! Why should I pay a premium price for an app that isn‚Äôt fully functional and can‚Äôt stand on its own? Strava needs to drastically reduce its price or fix the issue. To give a lame excuse, remove functionality, and expect me to keep paying the same price is ridiculous. If they can‚Äôt fix the problem, I will move on to something else.I've mainly used strava for tracking my runs, see pace, distance, etc. Strava is great for that and offers a social aspect where you can see friends activity, although I've never used it. Recently though it completely broke for me, I'm getting a 403 on everything except recording a run which means I can't save the stats or compare with previous runs. I've tried redownloading to no avail. Support articles on the issue are nonexistent.  There isn't a way for me to log out either, the bottom menu is screwed up so the icons overlap. Not sure whats happening but pretty disappointed. Apps have bugs, but this completely broke the app to the point that I can't even log out to fix it.I really like the social aspect of this app and have enjoyed the fitness tracking. But as I‚Äôve improved and try to compare my performance with previous rides I can see how inaccurate the tracking is. 
I frequently ride the same exact route to track my progress but have found the data to be so inaccurate as to be useless. I first noticed when it said I climbed 1500 feet and I know that hill was 900 the last time.  Other times it recorded it as little as 600 feet. 
Timing in segments is way off too. While trading with other riders, my stats were slower when I clearly finished the segment faster. 
IDK if it‚Äôs the phone, the satellites or the app but I wouldn‚Äôt pay for extra features.I don't get it‚Äîwhy does everyone rave about this app? It's okay, but it has less than half of the useful features of MyMyFitness. For instance, the voice feedback is a joke. You get your choice of splits and... nope, that's it. You can get splits at every mile or every half mile. Contrast that with MapMyFitness, which gives you seven options and eight interval choices at either distances or times. What about coaching? Forget it. Paying for premium is a total ripoff. There isn't even a delayed start option. Maybe the social media aspect is more appealing to some people, but UA has that covered too. There's just no question‚Äîwhen it come to fitness tracking, Strava can't compete.I‚Äôm a paid subscriber and relying on Strava to discover new routes and track segments. But lately the route discovery stopped working (no matter what I search for Strava shows me the same one little 3 mile route over and over again, and nothing else). Also as I‚Äôve started to use Training Peaks more and more for ride plans Strava has become less and less useful. Finally, the whole social aspect just doesn‚Äôt quite work for me... I don‚Äôt want it broadcasting every time I go for a walk or workout, but if I turn off integration (to shut it up) then it‚Äôs even less useful... I don‚Äôt see myself renewing next year.Strava is not properly tracking my runs. I have asked for advice via email, social media etc. no customer service. I run 25 minutes it says I ran 20 minutes. I run 3 mile it says I ran 2 miles. I hate to give a poor review and wouldn‚Äôt have, but the app just asked me to rate my experience. Poor customer service. It asks me to upgrade and I would probably consider it if there was any customer service to get the app fixed. I have tried to delete and re download and many other things. 

I know my other friends love it and I used to love it.The recent update with the refreshed gui and user experience is a nice enhancement. I think that the app has some great things going for it and right now it is the best of the rest when it comes to a social running log. I am giving this a two star review because of a critical functionality that is missing, I can‚Äôt update my shoes in the app. 

Strava does a great job keeping me updated with how many miles I put on my shoes but when it comes time to switch them out I have to sign in on the web to do it. This is difficult for no reason.The app is centered on social networking instead of the users who use it for self-fitness. One day last week, I forgot to end my cycling session, and the app continued to log activity during my drive home in my SUV. Who cycles at 60 MPH?! There is NO way to correct the saved activity manually. I‚Äôm not particularly eager to spend money on apps that control me or my capabilities. The reason for NOT allowing users to correct app errors manually is lame at best. The performance of the app does not justify the annual cost of the app. I‚Äôm canceling today.Lots of my friends have this all and I like the social aspect of it. I tried the free trial for their paid service and the data was useful. 

However, my pet peeve is when 3rd party apps don‚Äôt work properly on iOS. That‚Äôs the case with Strava. The syncing from the iOS Health app is atrocious. 

Initially I would manually upload my workouts. I‚Äôd get a notification that it was ready and then I could upload. 

Eventually I switched to auto and that‚Äôs when the trouble started. 

Now my workouts don‚Äôt sync. Deleted and reinstalled. Updated. Nothing. 

Since I track workouts with the Fitness app and my Apple Watch, I don‚Äôt use the tracking in Strava. So, since the app won‚Äôt sync the data from my Health app, I have zero need for it. 

It‚Äôs too bad because I really, really enjoyed the social aspect as well as the insights with the subscription.I used strava for a couple of months before deciding to upgrade to premium and let me tell you it is NOT WORTH IT.

As a free mileage and route tracker, strava performs as well as any other cycling app with the added semi-benefit of a social media style feed which no one really interacts with in a serious way. 

Upgrading to premium offers several benefits, none of which are actually that enticing. The main feature is being able to map your heart rate and caloric burn rate against other variables for each ride. 

What made me cancel my subscription is how poor the HR tracking actually is. There are huge flat spots and unexplained cliffs (example: going up a hill and strava says my HR is around 100bpm) on my charts consistently. This translates to returning home from a ride with a huge discrepancy in how much work you‚Äôve actually put in vs what strava tells you.

100% not worth the exorbitant subscription price.I started using Strava last summer for the social features, within our local parkrun group and other local running friends. Then in December I got an Apple Watch. Syncing was so easy - it just worked, and afterwards you could see your activities in the Exercise app and on your phone. It even tracked cross-country skiing - cool! (Try that, Nike Run.) 

BUT THEN IN FEBRUARY STRAVA BROKE IT!! Why? It no longer works. Activities recorded with the Strava complication don't show up in Exercise, don't show up as a workout, sometimes you don't even get the activity credit. PLEASE RESTORE THE OLD FUNCTIONALITY!Used to love this app but now its telling me theres no internet connection all of the time even when i have unlimited data and hotspot for my computer too. Beyond dissatisfied because I could not track the pace of my run or even save my data. This needs to be fixed cause this is unfair to the customer or others out there that have the same process. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling, updating and reconfiguring my wifi but nothing works. This needs to be fixed common yall get it together!!!Love the concept of essentially a social media platform for working out. Beyond that though, this app doesn‚Äôt offer anything that will help you become a better athlete. Blocking users data under by requiring a subscription to see things like splits is ridiculous. The app does not add monetary value or show metrics you couldn‚Äôt just see for free on Garmin. Again, love the concept of the app, but it‚Äôs not something that should be run as a for profit service to its users.The tools offered help me with training, however the new subscription price is too much. My watch‚Äôs app offers the same features for free.  In my opinion, strava is a social media app with a fitness component.  Features continue to be taken away and put on the subscription side. This is not providing access to users and it‚Äôs impacting my drive to keep using it. There are other tools out there and the subscription disheartens some users.I live in Venice Beach CA where there is no issue with cellular reception. I use Strava for running. Three out of five times I use the app it will lose connection during my run, not record anywhere from a quarter mile to a mile, but still count the time it was recording. This is a horrible morale ding when you‚Äôre trying to push yourself hard and you can‚Äôt accurately know how fast or far you‚Äôre running, especially when you are in the middle of the run. No issues like this with Map My Run.I generally really like Strava other than 2 key things. 1) It wont keep give me cumulative totals on any other activities on anything but basically Run/Bike/Swim but for example Id like cumulative distances and time spent Hiking or Walking.. I cannot get that from Strava where I can get all of that via GarminIQ ... Strava is more social but its inflexible for multi activity (-1.5) 
2) Eecently I am annoyingly being prompted to use Facebook to login every single time I login to Strava app.. NO NO NO NO... do you hear me... NO FORCED FACEBOOK integration. (-1.5 almost 2)Guys, I know the Apple Watch APIs aren‚Äôt the best. I know writing tests is a pain. I know that QA takes the backseat to feature development. But please, please test - and fix - your Watch app. I see a lot of people on Strava support complaining about Watch uploads just hanging and then being told that there‚Äôs a problem with their data connection. And now I‚Äôm having this issue too. This seems to have been going on since March. These are your customers that you‚Äôre leaving hanging for months! Pls fix.Long time user and fan of Strava. I hate the new algorithm based activity feed. I want the chronological feed back. There has been overwhelming backlash from the users and they aren‚Äôt listening. The social aspects of strava are fun and important to a lot of people, but the emphasis seems to be too heavy on becoming the next social network and not enough on fixing some of the technical issues. I‚Äôll submit a better review if they start listening.Love the app. But there are serious problems since the update with syncing from Apple Watch. It worked fine before. Now if I start a workout on the Strava app on my watch, it won‚Äôt upload. Syncs forever and tells me to check data connection. So I restart my phone and all that. Then it‚Äôll upload... but without calorie counts. And it will still say it has a pending upload. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but strava broke it.The fitness part of the app works well enough, but throughout the app they pack in so many advertisements, recommendations, social features and other cheap that I don't want and will never use. I already pay for the subscription, let me customize the app and turn off the junk, bloat, and spam. I want my workout data and that's it. Stop telling me how I should use the app.",0,runbikeeatM4c0770ModifiedAngelLateLifeRunnerGirltinhead168JTempojenettabjtw575NanakslBonist Pedeclaudozbeckmanyou asked 123dissapointed in QAipsarum1234The Talented Mr. Maconi r joeA2SquareLRODZZAlexJohnson127Kschroeder10210WhiteSoxSuckcrsouserhaveahennessyKvekvevekcekSigep739NoneyaApple,"Don‚Äôt purchase the appReally Charging for what others give free?No Sensor connect ruined a good appWish I could get into itSolid 2‚≠êÔ∏è appGreat for casual but seriously lacking elsewhereData is always incorrectNo Bluetooth compatibility anymore!Good stat tracker until recentlyInaccurate trackingSeriously UnderwhelmingLess and less useful...Poor customer service- app doesn‚Äôt work properly for meI hate/love this appToo Expensive For Basic FunctionalityWanted to love it but it has a fatal flawPremium not worth itThey BROKE Apple Watch syncing üò°Useles AppOverpriced subscriptionGood training tool, costs too muchHorrible connectivityStop Prompting me to login with FacebookApple Watch uploads hangWe don‚Äôt need a time machineSyncing watchJunk and clutter",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,0,0,0,0,1,27,9,1,1,0,3408,has_social,174

I‚Äôve used several running apps over the years. The one I have used consistently over the last 4 years has been Runkeeper. 
I have a few friends on Strava and I thought I‚Äôd try it again because I like the social aspect of sharing with friends. 
Strava has a lot of nice data and it seems that their paid service revolves more around training plans rather than focused on just giving you more data. This makes sense to me. I really want to like this app!
I use an Apple Watch but also carry my phone. The watch app starts up pretty fast so that‚Äôs a plus. 
My main issues with Strava is that I have to go to the website in order to add my shoes so I can track the mileage. This seems silly. I can‚Äôt find a reason for it. I don‚Äôt want extra steps to get the app set up I also have a big issue with the app not showing me two decimal places for mileage. This is beyond silly. It‚Äôs just dumb. Runner like stats. We don‚Äôt want to have to log on to the website to get info that should be available on the app. Isn‚Äôt the entire point of an application to be self contained? The app is good but be aware that setup will take you 10 extra minutes and that viewing stats will be something that you will have to set aside time to do AFTER your run.I‚Äôve used Strava for many years, I‚Äôve been running for about 9 years now and I always use it to train for my races. I love the social aspect and I‚Äôve never had an issue with the GPS when using my phone.

I recently got an Apple Watch series 3, the main purpose being for exercise. I wanted to ditch the heavy phone and run with something lighter. I also was excited about moving to Bluetooth headphones to avoid the phone/cord situation and the hands free aspect was really appealing. Not to mention the Apple Watch also tracks heart rate and other things that my iPhone didn‚Äôt do. However, I‚Äôve been really disappointed in the connection between my Apple Watch and Strava. My runs are totally off, it often gets the distances wrong, misses huge chunks of my runs, and records my runs as if I had gone way faster. I thought that this was a flaw in the watch but I have friends who have tried other apps with success. I also thought this was a matter of having the data plan, but I switched over to the one with data and I‚Äôm still having issues.

I would love to see them make improvement in this realm. I‚Äôm so excited about the convenience of my watch and I want to keep using Strava, so I‚Äôm hoping to see some upgrades soon!The social aspect of the biking got me to use this instead of MapMyRide. I love the badges and how motivational it is to beat your PRs and place in the top 10s. However, this thing is SEVERELY glitched. Granted, I‚Äôm using an iPhone and I keep it in my under saddle zip bag (could affect tracking?), but the times are heinously inaccurate. They have guys getting .03 seconds for a trail segment that‚Äôs 1/4 mile long, IN THE WOODS, on single track between trees. This isn‚Äôt even paved, and it‚Äôs physically impossible for a human to get those times, or even finish it in .10s for that matter. There are multiple people logging these ridiculous times. It‚Äôs important for me to know how I‚Äôm actually doing relative to the truth rather than fictional, glitched data. Completely deflates me when I put in maximum effort, easily clock under .30s on a trail segment and it reads 1:54!? I know I‚Äôm in the woods, but it‚Äôs absurd that in 2019 this data can‚Äôt be tracked with the utmost accuracy through some tree cover on a perfectly clear day. The features are really fun, but if the data can‚Äôt be trusted, this app is no better than a calorie counter.Love this app in many ways, but I wish it had better swim tracking.   I wish it had:
- open swim
- lap swim
- a setting for when you are wearing flippers 
- the ability to tap your iWatch when you completed a lap
- pregnancy mode 

It was also very hard to figure out how to get it to display detailed heart rate data.  Even my husband who uses Strava a lot and is a software engineer involved in UI design couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  

It‚Äôs a solid app, but it could use some better UI and improvements with certain sports.  Seems heavily rotated towards biking & running with not enough attention on swimming.   Wish they would purchase or parter with a better swim app like MySwimPro to get better swim data.  

Extra extra cool would be better integration of tides, swells, currents, and weather data for open swimmers.  In 2022, 12 people died near me open swimming and I wonder if apps like this could help people make more informed decision when making choices.  Strava could also advertise safety gear like a $20 swim buoy to open water swimmers.   Perhaps even with Strava logo on it‚Ä¶it could save lives.

Also wish it were easier to connect with other people doing my sports in the area.   Surprised the social aspect is so focused on existing friends.   Seems like a nice way to connect with others.  

Also wish it were easier to become aware of in-person competitions, races, clubs, and training opportunities.A lot of functionality is paywalled now. I‚Äôve done the free trial and paid for a few extra months on top of that. However, none of that functionality seems worth what you pay - like not even close. The app would be a no question subscription if it was $5 or $6 at the very most. They want double this so I doubt I‚Äôll ever see them come down.

My guess is that Strava doesn‚Äôt really care about those using the app for workouts and have begun to target those training for competition. Probably a fair idea since they will pay any premium to be on the social network. If you‚Äôre looking to track your rides for free or at a low cost, this isn‚Äôt your app - I suggest looking elsewhere. I‚Äôll probably move off the app since I‚Äôm not going to pay to compare myself to friends who have also moved on or don‚Äôt pay either.i appreciate the data collected and the personal feedback.  i like the ability to socially engage with and encourage my friends and acquaintances regarding their activities.  i purchased a subscription to support the development & growth if the application, but lately my feed has been inundated with offers & adds disguised as clubs and challenges to join.  sometimes i‚Äôll scroll for quite a long time to get past all of this.  if i didn‚Äôt pay for a subscription, i‚Äôd accept it as the price of admission, but i DO pay.  
several of my friends pay for & use Ride With GPS, & i have to admit, certain features, like turn-by-turn instructions for routes (strava doesn‚Äôt seem to offer this), are attractive, especially considering the lack of adds.  
Rethink this decision for your paying supporters, Strava.Nice app interface for basic functions. The social aspect isn‚Äôt too intrusive which is nice. It‚Äôs fun being able to compare times on different run segments. There‚Äôs some data in the pro version that isn‚Äôt accessible on the app which makes the pro version less desirable. Garmin uploads seamlessly which is nice. Some of the King of the Hill top times could be weeded out as there are impossible times (ie 1/4 mile run uphill has a king of the hill at <30 seconds). I understand why some of the pro features are paid (data analysis, Training plans, etc) but there are a few really basic features that are only for the pro version that should be accessible in the free version like setting a mileage goal for the week. Overall average app that I‚Äôd like to see improve because I use it all the time!I have enjoyed Strava for several years now, loving the social aspect of sharing the outdoors with my friends. The new update has taken away the formerly free features of being able to see other‚Äôs segment times. This has taken away much of the enjoyment of the app and has instilled disappointment in the company from everyone I know who uses the app. I would have been content with ads being placed on the app, but the change to premium membership to use these basic features has degraded the sense of community previously fostered by its use. I still enjoy the app for its ability to track miles and segments, however, I feel as though the community of Strava has been damaged by these new updates.Really like the social side of Strava and keeping connected to other runners. The basics of the app are good. One thing that drives me crazy‚Ä¶the audio cues work when logging an outdoor run but not for a trail run when it is more dangerous to look at your watch to get pace/distance. I‚Äôve resorted to starting activit√©s as outdoor run, then changing the activity after the fact, annoying. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is the run posting details are different in the feed for running based on the run activity type. If I log outdoor run, it shows my pace when it posts, if I log trail run, it shows elevation and total time, no pace. You have to go into the details of the trail run to see the pace.My old Garmin and my ASICS Runkeeper app agree almost perfectly for my routes. However, Strava gives me distances and average paces that make me look like I‚Äôm runner farther and faster than I actually am. The map shows a zig-zagging running path, which probably contributes to this. And I occasionally have a huge line on my running route that of course is not real. These problems don‚Äôt exist with the Runkeeper app or my Garmin. I overall like the Runkeeper app much better, but I continue to use Strava for the social aspect of seeing my friends‚Äô workouts. If the GPS accuracy was better, I would be much more satisfied with the app.While I consider Strava to be the best activity tracking social media platform on the market, it can still be better. The ability to group pedal assist rides with normal rides or as a stand alone heatmap would be super nice because the user workaround is to define a pedal assist ride as a normal ride which I‚Äôm certain aggravates users focused on segments. Another improvement would be to search ride history by bike ridden. 

Remember, if you don‚Äôt continue to improve a product or service, it‚Äôs fairly certain your competitors will catch and or pass you. 

From a happy user looking to help.The GPS is always off. I‚Äôve ran with my iPhone and Apple Watch. The Watch is more accurate than my phone. About a week into using the app, with my phone, the app registered the first .5 mile than lost connection for about a mile. The app showed me running through houses and even a pond lol. Today, now only using my watch, it didn't registered the first .5 miles. It‚Äôs really a shoot or miss, I start at the same point everyday and usually wait 30 sec after starting the run to make sure I have a solid connection. 

It might be unfair to blame this on the app since it does rely on gps, however I haven‚Äôt had this problem with other apps. 

I would suggest an edit feature after you run, in case there is an hiccup with the gps. 

TLDR: Overall the app is great, LOVE the design and the amount of data that is tracked, just fix the GPS connection and add an edit feature after the runStrava is great as social media, and for comparing with your friends, but seems to be lacking a little as a serious training tool. After a ride, I like to look at my phone and see how it compares with other rides. Unfortunately it seems to take an hour or two before the information gets from my watch to my phone. By then I am usually on to something else.  Segments are nice for comparing different areas with other athletes, but 1 mile intervals would be a great feature for seeing how you are doing on your daily rides.There is nothing really special about the app or strava platform in general. It is very generic and lacks any sort of specialization (customization of running metrics while running). There are plenty of better apps out there for running, swimming and cycling. The paid features aren‚Äôt worth it either, as you‚Äôre better off with a real training solution such as Training Peaks. The best features are the relatively open APIs that allow you to upload activities from other better apps so you can partake in the social aspect of Strava.Seriously, I do like the fact that I can have the app with the social connections and stuff like that. But I noticed that the accuracy of it is somewhat questionable. Like, I did a sprint once and it reads 32 fricking mph. Because the pace was 1:55 per mile. I know myself, and I know I CANNOT run that fast. Complete bogus. A few times it even reads 29 mph. And another time where it says I ran 18 mph tops on one of them. I know I can‚Äôt run that slowly because I was affirmed as 25 according to a video I took of me following a car at this speed.Largest issue I've had lately is that start times for rides are sometimes erratic when launching from the widget. Data isn't useless, privacy can be cranked down, social features exist but don't get in the way, and the duplicate entries in health issue seems to have been squashed (most likely apple is de-duping on uuids, like they should have been). It would be nice if there were some degree of quality filter for segments, though, and if geolocation did a better job of detecting segments adjacent to roads, and the difference from said roads...I like the idea of Strava on Apple Watch as a way to ditch the phone at home but still have activity recording and all the social components of Strava. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt terribly accurate. Strava‚Äôs Watch app doesn‚Äôt use GPS to calculate pace and distance it uses the pedometer. This seems silly because the app still uses GPS to track your route. Why not just do both? The app also drains the Watch battery much quicker than other workout apps such as Apple Workout or Nike Run Club.Great app with good features but seem to be focusing on constantly moving things around and pushing the social aspect more.  I am considering dropping and just going to the Garmin or Wahoo apps exclusively mainly for the dark mode setting.  Strava had this dark mode which is easier to read in direct sun light, but removed dark mode and implementing mediocre features instead.   The competition to Strava is getting better and less expensive.This app has literally not changed in years. How cool would it be if it notified you if you took a segment from a friend? Or if a friend took a segment from you? Or if you completed segments for the first time? Or if you set a new record for that year?

I really wish they would improve this kind of stuff instead of adding more social media features like uploading a video.Strava is the best cycling app, however the new version is atrocious. The change to the more macro view of the analysis is complete crap. Please change it back to what it was (separate page for each with more detail) or make it even more detailed than the previous version (speed, elevation, HR, etc.). Users are more concerned with the functionality and the data than we are it being a ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù fitness sharing app.The app is great social tool for biking, running, and swimming. However there is zero support for triathletes which boggles my mind considering that ppl have been asking for this for a long time.  One main activity with total tri time which can be drilled down to see the separate sport times. How about triathlon challenges?  Almost impossible hitting sport specific challenges when your training for 3 different ones.I‚Äôve used Strava for years, it‚Äôs kind of a social network for activities. However they‚Äôve now put so many ads in it I‚Äôve deleted it. But they haven‚Äôt made enough of a value proposition to justify buying it, they just ripped a few features of from Training Peaks and added ads. Rather than actually making the app better. So, thanks for the good times but see ya Strava. üëãLove the app for fitness tracking. The FB mimicry is disappointing. I liked strava bc it was less garbled and less like the other social networks. I get you‚Äôre trying to increase engagement. Then come up with something unique, rather than just miming FB/IG. And, last thing: the paywall gobbling up an increasing number of features is a bummer. That is all.Better than nothing. Better in some ways than anything. Mostly does what it should. Stable, keeps its satellite connection. But it thinks all biking is the same - doesn‚Äôt distinguish between road & mountain. Calories-burned estimates are bound to be inaccurate, but 10 mph lollygagging on the road vs 10 mph ripping on singletrack ate entirely different. Not on Strava.The social aspect about the app is amazing, the main thing it‚Äôs lacking is the ability to customize what is shown on your watch when you do your activity. With the amount of other workout apps that embrace the Apple Watch much better it‚Äôs hard to recommend Strava to another casual runner who doesn‚Äôt really care for the social aspects of the app.I have pushed my Garmin Connect data to Strava for years. It has an elegant design and solid social features, but what‚Äôs most frustrating is how few people seem engaged in the community. While many friends have signed up, only a handful are active users. I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a commentary on Strava or American fitness, but it leaves me wanting more in the app.Love the app, but the GPS connection to Apple Watch is too spotty to truly trust when training. Rarely does it actually pickup the starting location so on a run the first half might be a straight line. You‚Äôll never be able to calculate your true stats. Providing feedback to Strava doesn‚Äôt seem to resolve the issue.I have this paired with my Garmin vivoactive 4s and Strava is entering my times incorrectly. My garmin shows different times than strava and strava is supposed to be pulling them data from Garmin but it‚Äôs putting in the wrong data and strava won‚Äôt let me edit. Love this social aspect of this app but I may quit if it keeps putting in slower times that I‚Äôm actually doing.",0,Aaron MacomSG üåªhouse_of_ALTNerea007Verder_jchizleDirtBagDocfinnallenMobAppGuyMC-SwizzleBlackpass55SlumericanWolfHodejodeJohnnyTranWasInnocentHydra SagariatypoofcemfreshpowdrRhyaukDizzyBalloonLoverBiggamehunter78bigetanAkaioJust want easy mobile depositJimmyNick216Football boxJ T.

I have been waiting in vain for years for you to add ANY sort of interval training with distance, time, and heart rate. I would accept just a simple timer in the app, but audio cues for speed/HR/timers/distance and customizable training plans would be preferred. People might think with the paid version they would get it, but they would be wrong. Since this MAJOR OVERSIGHT has been noted by people on your forums, you know about it, but are willfully ignoring us, your users. I have almost reached my breaking point and am about to give up hope and switch to Runkeeper or <gasp> Nike. It feels like the Benedict thing to do, but I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOU FOREVER! The saddest part will be leaving all my Strava friends behind for literally any other app that has this, simply because you refuse to add such a staple of training: INTERVALS. This is my last ditch effort to get ANY SORT of interval training in Strava, but if you don‚Äôt add it soon I am done with you üò¢. Seriously Strava, DON‚ÄôT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU!!! I LOVE THE REST OF THE APP TOO MUCH!I really enjoy the social side of sharing workouts with my friends in a non-competitive setting. 
This app does well to try and push the positives of being active and not expressing the negatives as much (ex. Being over competitive, putting yourself above others, and shaming peers in passive ways). It can be very easy to start putting yourself above others when you start to work out more and feel the confidence building in your ego.

Anyways, my main gripe is that there are a plethora of bugs lying between the iphone app and the apple watch app. It would be really nice to see the transition from one to the other feel more cohesive and seamless.

I have not tried the Samsung side of things with these apps so I cannot say this is all of Strava. I just wish and hope for a more attention to the iOS platform. 

I don't know, maybe allow us to edit/crop an activity more than just the start and end of it. I have days where I walk a ton for work and like to record the when day but have to drive intermittently during that  period of time and it gets included in the final post, then gets flagged. 

I would love to post edit the activity more. The pause option isn't enough for me as I get too busy and don't have time to go towards that.My old tracker app was not going to be supported by iOS 11 and a friend recommended Strava. I really like the app and appreciate that it does everything I need despite the focus on social networking which isn't my cup of tea.

The one thing that really bugs me is Strava's requirement for Background App Refresh to be active. I never needed to have that on for my previous tracker and I don't even need it for most apps which handle GPS and data functions just like Strava. I usually leave that function off to preserve battery life so it is an extra step (along with turning on location services) I have to take when starting Strava. If it could be updated to eliminate that requirement, I would give this app 4.5 stars (I know I have to pick an integer).Great way to connect with friends, compare segment performance, and download routes. However I feel other apps do some non-social things better. For example: The app Ride with GPS creating routes feature is a fine tuned machine compared to Strava‚Äôs clunky beta route builder, even my Lezyne GPS comes with a better route builder online app.  The ability to upload a GPX file not related to a Strava activity into the Strava route builder would be helpful.  Overall Strava has become the Facebook of Running, Cycling and swimming with some good features, but it‚Äôs currently not the one and only app I use at the moment. I go back and forth on if the premium membership is with the cost, but I‚Äôll likely renew.Pros: strava is ubiquitous amongst cyclists, runners, etc. plus in general a great place to follow others‚Äô training.
It syncs up to most other apps and devices. 
Good analyses of meta data to help you understand your training history and metrics.
Cons:
The UI is not flexible. This app still seems analog in so many ways with regards to being a social app and allowing features and data from other apps to be used and synced.",0,Shmarmychaff808facebookFlyingEarevancyclesJAH live,"Has ALMOST every thing I want but...Love to use it, but hate the bugsWhy Background App Refresh?Great Social Activity app with some features needing improvementFunctionality",StravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,809,has_social,174

At its core, it‚Äôs pretty good at logging your activities and recording your performance on  prepare segments. I have been disappointed with some of the a features that could have been added over the last several years. Some of the community growing and actual evolution into a social network feels lacking and contributes to feel like a club of the same very specific people. That said, they‚Äôve been doing a nice job in the last 6 months with brightening up the app, improving some of the core features and experience. There haven‚Äôt been the same core changed to the platform that I really would have liked to see but I have hope that we‚Äôre making more progress andI like the app to keep track of the miles I ride.  I would suggest one serious improvement, one wishful modification, and have had one user issue.

The serious improvement I‚Äôd like to see, is a more sensitive auto-pause mode.  I see many race-oriented cyclists running through stop signs.  I think Strava is contributing to this.  If the pause feature worked better, cyclists could stop at stop signs and be penalized less.

The issue I have is that my rides do not get saved frequently.  I have an iphone 8+ with the latest software update.  Sometimes I check my ride stats at the first stop, and there are none.  Sometimes I try to end and save a ride, and an older ride I did pops up instead.  Sometimes it looks like it‚Äôs saving a ride for me, but the upload simply fails.  This always happens when I get home, and have an excellent internet connection.

The wishful improvement I‚Äôd like to see is auto-record.  I used to use ‚ÄúMoves‚Äù before i started using Strava.  With that app, it records your rides the minute you leave the house.  You don‚Äôt have to launch the app and start it.  I often forget to start Strava, which results in me losing many miles.

Thanks!Strava has made one of the best GPS exercise social media apps. But the lack of features and customization typical in a standard GPS watch is very disappointing. Please add the ability to take manual splits with a double tap to the Apple Watch version of the app! Also, the ability to customize the metrics for the watch app display is badly needed. These missing features make the Apple Watch app version inferior to a standard GPS watch. Lastly, please add the ability to build workouts for runs, such as intervals based on time or distance, so that we can do basic workouts like fartleks, mile reps, and lactate threshold distance based workouts.Strava is like social media for runners and athletes of all types. Overall, it‚Äôs great to see friends‚Äô activities. I even used Strava to get connected to other runners when I moved to a new city.

But the app almost always has random weird bugs. Today, it won‚Äôt let me add photos to my workout. Other times, it will disconnect from my Garmin account so none of my workouts would sync. They get things fixed but it takes a while.Strava is awesome and I am a premium member. However I am disappointed that my Apple Watch and my phone are entirely separate. I would like to be able to access my premium content on my phone during a ride and also have the info on my watch. What I get is two entries and the stats do. It match. My Apple Watch should act as a remote and/or an additional display for my iphone app. I would like to start my ride on my watch, stop it in my phone add the photos I took and submit it to my social media.People beg for their newsfeed to be in chronological order yet every social platform thinks you want it organized by what you interact with most. That‚Äôs senseless for a workout app. How are you supposed to encourage people who may not be an everyday athlete when their activities get pushed passed people who workout constantly? Please put the feed back in chrono order or allow us to choose to put it in order. I‚Äôm tired of just seeing the same 10% of people I follow when I open the app.The year in sport was great marketing for strava.  People would share them around other social media and with friends creating great awareness of how cool it is.  NOW, year in sport is locked behind a pay wall.  I‚Äôd love to know the genius that did that, say bye to your biggest free marketing of the year!  Please don‚Äôt ruin the app by continuing down this horrid path of the pay wall, because it really is a great app and I would really hate to see that happen!I would find the notifications, specifically badges useful to enhance the social aspect of Strava, except they do not work. As long as I‚Äôve used Strava (about 4 years) the notifications are always stuck at 26 and do not reflect activity of those I follow. I usually end up turning them off. But try turning back on from time to time. I‚Äôm surprised Strava hasn‚Äôt fixed this, especially with the big push last year for paid subscriptions.Over all the app is great. Maps and segments are super fun. Analysis of rides/ runs are interesting. It can be fairly social but it‚Äôs not nearly as active as other social media‚Äôs. 

I changed my password online and had to sign out/ back in. Unfortunately the sign up and dig in button look exact the same and now my app is stuck in their sign up flow. Tried deleting and reinstalling the app and no dice.Hi!

I use Strava to sync my Peloton rides to my Apple Watch. Lately, it has been posting the same ride 10 times - which feeds 10 rides to my watch each day. While that would be impressive, it‚Äôs NOT accurate. Suggestions on how to stop that?

Otherwise, appreciate the 3rd party connection between Apple and Peloton.",0,Doofus jonesThe Dude SThe Mr. MarcusiehixonstevewellsishereNolacrazygrlUser_547632tracylnFoo McFoosteinValelaine,"The go-to competitive activity tracker; finally improving UIWorks Pretty WellAdd splits for Apple WatchGood ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù for active people, but often buggyApple Watch and iphone not seamless.Good but...Great, fun app, please don‚Äôt destroy itPlease fix notificationsGreat app bad sign up/in experienceHow do I stop multiple recordings of the same workout?",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,0,0,0,1,0,10,0,0,0,0,1032,has_social,174

It has become our own little version of social media over the years and many of us are on there almost every day. Recently, a few of us have had a problem where our Garmin devices have become disconnected from Strava, so our activities stop syncing. I have personally had this happen at least twice now over the last month or so. It is a little frustrating to have to continually reconnect the app when it has been connected previously with no issues. Hopefully this problem gets resolved soon!While most people think of Strava as a an app to track fitness, in reality it is that and much more.  It truly has been the key to a better and richer quality of life for me.  Through it, I‚Äôve gotten over that first awkward bit of not knowing or remembering someone‚Äôs name and allowed me to gain insights into who they really are.  It has been a irreplaceable part of my social circle through we I stay in contact with friends far and near.  Through it my friends and I encourage, tease, joust regularly.  I am generally a quiet and reserved person, but when I‚Äôm exercising that all changes and Strava basically allows me to carry over that openness to the rest of my life.This has been one of the more comprehensive workout apps. I have 2 suggestions: include .01 miles for runners, and make the watch app a little less finicky. I'm always struggling to get it to start up at the beginning of a workout, or after pausing to restart. That can cost valuable time when you're doing speed workouts... I've seen some apps use a twist of the dial for starting or stopping, or a hard press on the face. Either way would work better than tapping a tiny icon and hoping for the best. I love the app, especially the social aspect, it just needs some fine tuning.I enjoy using Strava. I find the data valuable and I really like the way it is presented with various graphs and visuals. I prefer it to Garmin Connect and like the social component. Recent concerns about safety have caused me to use the route hiding features, which I appreciate, but now I cannot participate in segments and such. I can‚Äôt justify paying for the price increase to nearly $80/year for the same data as Garmin connect presented in a more visually pleasing app. I probably would have just kept paying the $55/year.I love this app over other fitness tracking apps. However! I think integrating a private messaging or something along those lines would be a good addition. I can see it kind of making it a ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù app, but the only way to meet new people is through commenting. When you need to exchange phone numbers or emails it has to be done via the comment section of an activity. When doing that, it leaves it open to the public to do with they please with it; when it was intended for someone else. Other than that no issues at all. Great app.This is one app where I don‚Äôt mind subscribing because my subscription supports further development. Although I enjoy the sharing and social media aspects of the app it is my principal way to keep a diary of activities and compare them year to year. To that end I would really like a more robust compare to this month last year feature. Also since I ride with a two sided power meter I would really find it useful to have left right balance displayed in the analysis section.Strava has become an important part of my training and I use it every day. Having a few of my friends and family members on it gives me a little nudge of social reinforcement when I am deciding whether to work out or not. It‚Äôs been an awesome way to track my progress, and the interface is easy to use. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is I‚Äôve had some trouble at the end of workouts with routes disappearing. I also wish they were better support for hiking, but it‚Äôs still one of my favorite apps!I‚Äôve been a long time user of Runkeeper and just recently switched to Strava for the social aspect. There are a lot of nice features but I do miss some things from Runkeeper. Primarily, customizing your audio cues (by time or distance, split pace, current pace, average pace, etc). And it seemed easier to access your activities and see general summaries and stats on Runkeeper, but that might just be lack of familiarity with Strava. In any case it does the job and I‚Äôll continue to use it!I connect my Garmin app to Strava primarily for the social aspect of fitness. We can‚Äôt always run or workout with friends each time but following along on Strava is the perfect motivation I need most days to get out when I normally wouldn‚Äôt because you know your fitness group will see you, cheer you on and motivate you to do it again. It‚Äôs always good for some humble bragging too when you want to challenge those same friends to push themselves and compete.Overall great app. The connection between Strava and my Apple Watch series 2 is better than I expected. However, I feel in a future update you should be able to edit the time or distance manually. While running in the woods or on trails the GPS is naturally lower than what you‚Äôre actually running, so it would be good to be able to edit it to an extent so the pace isn‚Äôt way lower than it‚Äôs supposed to be.I LOVE Strava! The only reason I held a star back is because there is no direct method in which to message other subscribers. If messaging is too complicated of a feature for the app, then I think allowing users to input their socials in a specific area on their profile would be great.

Aside from that complain the app is solid on all devices I use it with.Great App, works great with Apple Watch, the social feature is very motivating, just wish I could find how many miles I‚Äôve run in a particular month. I‚Äôm shocked this info isn‚Äôt available on app or the web interface, even with full subscription. Friends ask, how many miles you run in June? and I tell them I have no idea because I use Strava.I really enjoy using Strava. It supports most all exercise activities. It also supports most exercise companion devices and the GPS is fairly accurate. The one thing I would like to see added is direct messaging. If they ever add that feature, Strava could very well compete with some other social media platforms.Definitely enjoy this app, it is my favorite social media as a distance runner. However there should be a way to group runs together if you‚Äôre doing several reps in a workout. This way you‚Äôre not spamming everyone with 10 consecutive posts and it would all become a group workout. Would love to see this on Strava but otherwise great app!",0,Yorkster12iHawkeye910scootdogg72JkchambAdrians MustacheChainDropperthomas1138Random57841379Lovegirl05431SDSheplightsourceXFuturegrace BunnShooMBBeck,Strava ObsessedWhat is StravaGood...

I thought that was fixed with latest update because the timer keeps going.  

I tried to run four miles two different days and I begin looking at my screen a lot at 3.8.   The timer kept going but the distance was stuck on 3.8.  I finally stopped looking at the screen at hit 4.0 eventually.  This has happened last two runs and kills my average speed and try distance.   

I‚Äôm pretty sure the app stops counting miles when the screen is active.   I don‚Äôt know if this is related to auto-pause or not.  I‚Äôve turned auto pause off and don‚Äôt look at the screen anymore.  The app is definitely buggy.  Strava creates a great social network that is the standard for cycling, but stick with Your Garmin and then upload.  Not sure why it‚Äôs taking this long to build a stable watch app.  I never had problems with the phone app.Been using Map My Ride for a long time now and am a paid subscriber. MMR works well and connects to my speed, heart rate, and cadence meter so easily. But the app is a lil - ugly. It also is geared more towards runners. So I thought I‚Äôd try out Strava and see why all the fuss is about - I signed up for the 30 day summit trial and everything looks - well - amazing. Keeps track of the miles I put on my bike and a myriad other brilliant things. Guess what though? No Bluetooth sensor connection - none. You need other supported devices to do that THEN upload that data to your Strava account. Guys, guys, nope. I‚Äôm going to cancel my 30 day free subscription. I‚Äôll keep my dumbed down free account for now but won‚Äôt actually use the app for recording rides. If the Bluetooth sensor availability is changed I will definitely be forking out the $2 a month for the analysis pack. Until then - forget about it.Strava used to be great, featuring a wide variety of functions and more in depth and sophisticated training programs, route builder and much more for premium. But now everything is basically premium or nothing, something as basic as weekly mileage is not premium only, all that‚Äôs left is challenges, minor statistics, leaderboards, and the standard social aspect for posting and giving others kudos. Strava was never good at connecting people with the cycling community in their area and worse now that everything is premium only. Really considering deleting if it isn‚Äôt for my habit of using this to record. There‚Äôs really no point specially if you have a computer, I might as well use my personal device‚Äôs app. Strava is going to die up if this goes on.I‚Äôve been using Strava app since 2012. It was an incredible simple program then but an awesome innovation to what motivates athletes (a race every day). At that time it was social but not intrusive. It allowed you to see other people if you knew there name by searching. Now it post people recommended by other friend‚Äôs connections, sort of the same algorithm as Facebook. It clutters the screen on the app. It is annoying to delete the suggestion just to have it show up again. If I wanted Facebook, I would use that instead   Some people may  request that feature but my friends agree it is annoying as well. The ability to add gear is not available on the app. I cannot figure out why.Please, please Zwift....keep the sport clean and fun by strictly enforcing removal of people who choose to apply grotesque swears words as their names ( there are children watching and riding/running) or those who want to bring politics onto the screen whilst we‚Äôre all riding.  Getting on Zwift is supposed to be an opportunity to leave the world behind for an Time as well as a break from the social media ‚Äúcall out crowd‚Äù,  those who choose to say and do things blindly behind the veil of E-nonymity.  I think I speak for the majority using your great app: don‚Äôt let it be poisoned by these people with no class, etiquette or manners.For some reason Strava can‚Äôt recognize more than one data stream with same time and GPS info as being one activity, so duplicate activities get published.  Also, no rewards for explorers on new pathways (only workout or race, no explore) for runners and cyclists, and road vs mountain vs gravel, just cycling.  Otherwise it‚Äôs the best social media sports app.I like Strava but not the best app for me.  I wish it showed one mile markers and had an audible which told me every time I completed a mile.  I also would like to be able to download a route and get turn by turn directions.  The social aspect is ok but not that important to me.The reason to have a paid account is for planning routes. Can‚Äôt do that on free. I love tracking my miles and most of my friends use Strava so I stick with it. If a more socially connected app existed I would ditch it.",0,Cool breeze 12345goodkarmaduderob the artist1fitdoccicledazeatufft2Trschoolboyshannongrahamtx,Latest iwatch 3 updateNo Sensors?Pay to playCould be betterSwear words and PoliticsThe best Is yet to comeLike not loveRecording great ride-planning not,StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,1,1,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,0,878,has_social,174

The creator(s) of this application have the athlete‚Äôs mindset. Once I start Strava, it records your location, activity, duration, elevation changes etc. I do not have to check the application multiple times. The app gives you direct voice feedback while your in the midst of the activity. Probably the only feature I would add at this point would be a reminder of sun rise or sun set for those on long bike trails. In addition, maybe it could potentially have a connection to weather channel  if there is a unscheduled weather pattern changes I.e. severe thunder storms and lighting, etc.I love having a shareable log of all my activities, heart race and pace histories, lists of my personal records and automatic notifications when I break them. The achievement system gamifies my runs and the monthly fitness levels keep me self aware of my training on a longer term level. I also like how it automatically detects when I do the same route, and then gives me a history of my performance on that same route / activity / run / ride. I love Strava so much I applied to work there as a software engineer an eon ago, haven‚Äôt heard back though ü§£ it‚Äôs basically social networking for athletes, real athletes not wannabesStrava has replaced all my other social services and apps completely, and so much more. So many great things in this app, for instance, PR tracking and notifications, Strava flybys, integration with endless other services and hardware, auto upload workouts from other devices, so many things it‚Äôs too long and vast to list all the features but those are some of my favorites but barely scratch the surface.

If you are interested in working out, and interested in sharing the activity with your friends and tracking it like a video game: this is for you, very good for workout motivation also.I have used and enjoyed other activity tracking apps. I, like many others, was introduced to Strava by a friend. I enjoy the social aspects, being encouraged by friends and in turn encouraging them. I enjoy having challenges to work toward. I love seeing how my runs compare to previous runs. I am glad that the developers keep trying to make the app better.

I tried premium but my training style is more casual so there was not as much value in it for me. A tiered subscription might be enticing for users who are not trying to be professional athletes. Plus my friends can already track me with other apps.Strava is the king of all ride/run tracking apps, and is probably in the top-3 I use overall, in terms of frequency. It‚Äôs the best ride and run  tracker, that‚Äôs a given. But it‚Äôs also great for almost any other activity, and the social features - particularly public segments, leaderboards, photo sharing, discussions, route creation, club organization etc. etc. are extremely sticky and it‚Äôs hard to imagine any challenger ever dethroning it. I don‚Äôt have any financial stake in the company, I just genuinely love the app. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs far and away the best in its field. 5+ stars.Strava is the only social media I interact with, no this isn‚Äôt a social media app but I sure do love getting to show my friends how fast I am. 

Long time bike run club user, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of their sharing model to show my friends I can run fast. Really enjoy competing on Strava and the endless course records all over.

It‚Äôs like the Pok√©mon go of running, you can go out and catch all the course records in your neighborhood or as far as Brazil. Love seeing how much faster I am than most and getting encouragement from all my friends that see how fast I am.

Could do without all the peloton posers but o guess I can deal. Could use a better music app integration as well to really make strava my one stop shop. 

The watch integration is great and literally got me to buy the Iwatch ultra just so I could stop running around like a doofus with my phone in my hands. Overall I love it and think I run more because of it.I love this app‚Äîit‚Äôs clean, it works with my watch, and it‚Äôs engaging enough that I will scroll through it even when I‚Äôm not in the middle of a workout just to see what others are up to. Two things: I would add the ability to un-kudo something (not that it‚Äôs necessarily something I‚Äôve needed to do, what‚Äôs wrong with spreading the love? But having the option would make the experience more akin to a typical social media app.) also, the ability to give kudos on comments. If these were added I think Strava would be the epitome of a model running app. Checks every box for me. Cheers.I‚Äôve been using Strava since 2010 and really have been happy with the whole experience. The feature updates and privacy controls introduced over the years have kept it leading edge and fun. I love seeing old rides and bringing back memories of when I was in great fitness and also when I was struggling. I‚Äôve made many friends by meeting them and sharing rides. It‚Äôs still amazing that you can scroll through and only see following friends but no ads! I‚Äôd say this is the best social media platform available üôÇThe kudos are cool but even if you‚Äôre not totally into the social side of it, Strava helps you track your fitness and explore areas around you. Premium is worth it in having access to friendly competition in the segments and challenges and I get so much use out of the route builder, especially when traveling since it helps you see common paths the locals enjoy. Super easy integration for your fitness trackers and other apps, and the camaraderie and support you can find in the communities is like nowhere else!This is one of the best cycling/running apps that I have used over the years. It can track your location mid ride/run if you check it often and it doesn‚Äôt take much time to load ( 30 secs top). It does have one downside though, it is that you have to use the internet on you phone or computer to put in your gear. It also has a social thing where you can see what you or your friends are doing or see where they have been riding/running that week. Overall this is a very good app and I highly suggest downloading it. So have fun and happy trails everyone.I have had Strava for about a year and a half now and let me say, it's amazing. The amount of features that you get without paying the subscription is outstanding. The app got even better for me when in January, I purchased an Apple Watch Series 4. It works seemlessly on my watch, tracking all my segments and such correctly. The app has motivated me with its challenges and social aspect to get out more and run/ride/hike etc. I have lost nearly 30lbs since the beginning of the year and Strava has certainly helped. Hope to see the app get even better with time.Love the app and yes I pay for it. It‚Äôs a pretty great and really helps with training. The social element is useful as well

My biggest complaint, which is small, is the fact that when I run, it won‚Äôt tally up the times.  it‚Äôll tell my my mile splits( very helpful) but it won‚Äôt add them up at a quick glance in the app. For example, it‚Äôll tell me 8:00, 8:00and 7:00 but won‚Äôt tally them up telling me it‚Äôs a 23:00. Small detail but a pain. It‚Äôll tell me overall but won‚Äôt tell me each mileage total time.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to mash up social media with a running/cycling app? Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to map your runs/rides, track your distance, monitor your goal progress, post running/cycling photos while also cheering on your friends who are working on their goals? 

Good news! The mash-up has already been developed with Strava. It is the cyclist and runner‚Äôs app joined with social media. I love it! It inspires me to see my fellow runners‚Äô progress. I can like their posts and add comments. The Strava app has boosted my progress as a runner this year.Been using Strava for almost two years (a trail marathon, a 50K and several adventure runs in there). That‚Äôs not boasting (just look at my times), but it is saying I feel like I‚Äôve tested it out. 

The free version has all the metrics I would ever want and for a few bucks I add some safety with the Summitt add on. The peace of mind to change routes in the middle of a run without feeling bad because I switched up the plans I left behind is worth it. 

The social media aspect is not a big deal to me, but i know others like it.I‚Äôve been using Strava since high school and throughout college as a student-athlete. I love how user friendly the app is and the workout analysis it gives after my runs. I also love how easy it is to sync my data between my Garmin Forerunner 255 and Garmin Connect which automatically loads my runs to strava without having to open the app. 

Great user friendly app and seamless connection between GPS watches!Strava has changed my life by helping me see the affect that different approaches to my athletic life . I have been a member since day one. I have logged over 50,000 miles on my bike and a ton of walks and hikes. They are all accessible. Plus now when I travel I can find where to ride! Awesome! Not to mention the challenges and social aspect. I stay in touch with friends in other countries through Strava. I love Strava!I‚Äôve been using Strava for years and have an excellent record of every workout, hike and long walk. They continue to add value with social (great for motivation and encouragement, especially the challenges), unique analysis (really cool to review the chart of my times for a given run, etc.) and ease of use. Try the free version if you like but then cough up a few bucks to keep it going.I‚Äôve been a Strava user for over 8 years and honestly have had nothing but good experiences in using this app. It worked flawlessly throughout my 2015 cross country ride and continues to be my go-to app for recording my daily rides. The social aspect is a bonus and I highly recommend premium membership for the modest monthly fee. What are you waiting for?I‚Äôve started running and taking long 4-5 mile walks during quarantine. Having this app has been such a blessing because it tracks everything! Miles, pace, total time, and where I‚Äôve been. I also love the social aspect where I can join clubs and earn digital trophies for different challenges. I have the watch app as well and it works wonders! I‚Äôm a big fan and highly recommend!!Strava has revolutionized my fitness journey with its rich features and social aspect. Connecting with friends, joining challenges, and tracking progress in activities like running and cycling keeps me motivated. The app's detailed analytics and compatibility with various devices make it an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their fitness experience. Highly recommended!This app has so much going for it. Social Media for athletes. It not only tracks all of your activities, it connects you with other athletes. Tracks you daily, weekly, monthly and yearly totals.. you are able to compete against yourself or others. Strava is not just an app it‚Äôs a way of life! It can be another layer of motivation in your daily life. If it didn‚Äôt happen on Strava it didn‚Äôt happen..üòÜI have used it as a social media for runners for a while now and I absolutely love it. It does everything that Id like it to. One problem though, it is a pretty easy addition, make it so you can add in more specificity in the distance on a manual run. If I do a 400m race I can only put in .20 or .30 so another slot would be a nice addition.I don‚Äôt use this app for improving as an athlete or monitoring my stats (although that might happen eventually.) I love how this app connects me to other people, I love the interactive maps, and I love naming my rides. This might be my gateway app for social media, I‚Äôve recently considered using FB, but let‚Äôs not get carried away. Kudos Strava.Love this app , enjoy track my Miles and feet of climbing. Enjoy signing up for challenges each month. The only thing I don‚Äôt like now with a group of friends that you have ,you can‚Äôt always see everyone unless you click on them. Sort of like Facebook you lose connections with them.Truly abismal customer service. I paid for the update once they put the majority of their features behind a paywall, was double charged, then had the subscription removed completely. I submitted multiple tickets online, emailed them, and contacted them in social media. Crickets on their end.I used to live for Runkeeper. That was a huge app for me. The great coaching and such. Loved it!!! After almost a decade on runkeeper i moved to Strava‚Ä¶.wow! Runkeeper was the first app that I could compete and talk to others like a social media platform. Strava was even better. Since joining I‚Äôve gained mileage and have meet people all around the world. Strongly recommend this app!!!!I‚Äôm not into instagram or other social sites but I love using Strava to see what my friends all over the world are doing for fun and training as well as sharing my own exercise adventures. The recent updates have also made tracking performance metrics a lot easier, although other apps like TrainingPeaks are better for that kind of thing.I love the app. It tracks a lot of stuff and makes tracking not only your running but help stay connected with friends as well. 

My only complaints would be resulted to the Apple Watch interface.

1.  Unable to hear starts, mile markers, and finishes when using the Apple Watch. Especially when music is playing. 

2.  On the Apple Watch while you are running it does not show your distance to the hundredth place only to the tenth place. 

3.  When posting to social media, it again only shows the distance to the tenth and not the hundredth. It rounds down the distance when posting.  Trivial, but still.  Show the whole distance!I resisted using Strava for a long time and finally gave it a go. Some of the metrics are questionable nor am I using the social aspect of it. Tracking and segments shine for me. The segments have changed the way I ride for the better and give me motivation to push harder. I mainly go at it solo so having goals mid ride are a huge plus. I upgraded to premium after 2 weeks. I‚Äôm happy!Strava is the premiere exercise ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù and it really lives up to the hype. I always look forward to putting my runs on Strava and seeing what my friends did. Our club leaderboard is a great source of friendly competition that pushes us to run more. Segments are always fun and add a new fun dynamic to running. Just a great app all around.I rarely leave reviews but this app has changed my life. I started cycling 3 years ago and Strava has been one of the main motivators to keep me training. It is fun to push yourself and see the progress in such a clean and clear format. The social aspect is great and SO POSITIVE. It is truly a community platform and Strava continues to get better and better. 

Kudos to you Strava!I'm not competitive athlete I just practice physical activity for join and be healthy and Strava gives me the opportunity to analyze my progress, shows me new tracks and contact me with would wide active people. Very nice app as performance, tour ir social media, once you can follow and be followed, comment and post photos. I recommend. ‚ù§Ô∏èIf you like to ride, you need this app. Between segments and the social aspect of Strava, it's a great tool to track your own performance and improvements, as well as keep tabs on how your friends (or professionals) are doing. It's a must have, particularly now that Strava is regularly updating and improving the UI.Longtime Strava user and happy that I made the switch in recent years to the premium version; not only bc the data, features and connections are so great but also to what little I can to support the founders who have continued to bypass the commercial and monentizing forces‚Ä¶I remember back in the day trying to use a spreadsheet to track my exercise. Ha, double ha, triple ha. Strava came along and took care of all that. I love going after segments, and just documenting rides. Strava helps you connect with other cyclists (or runners, or other athletes). It‚Äôs kind of what social media should be. Thanks Strava. Keep doing.I love that this is a social media platform that does not allow private messaging. As a betrayal trauma survivor who uses triathlon training to help her heal, I love having this as a safe social media outlet for my athletic pursuits. Private messaging on other social media platforms is hugely triggering to me, but I feel safe with my spouse and my kids on Strava.I like the social part of this app. Meeting new people and being able to give each other praise for workouts. Even from people you have never meet. They can give you kudos on a hard workout. Feels nice. Plus all the metrics it tracks is amazing.Amazing resource for motivation and thrills. Huge social aspect to the app that makes exercising the most fun. I really recommend this app for any type of athlete. Whether you are just starting out or you are an advanced athlete - this is the place to log all your hard work and stay connected to the rest of the fitness world.I can be biased because I am clearly addicted to this app. It helps me to track my progress, ensure I can verify my results, but also adds a great flavor to the social life. Challenging friends to beat your record on a segment or chasing some KOMs is an amazing add on.
Again I am addicted to it and using it most of a day  :)Strava is my go to app for recording my walks, hikes, etc. Easy to use, helps keep me motivated, and I enjoy the social aspect. It‚Äôs also nice to be able to add photos. The built-in map gives me a feeling of security when on an unfamiliar route. It‚Äôs ia great way to avoid getting lost!1. Best-in-class
2. Privacy standards are above industry standard
3. Social component/challenges do not overwhelm the app‚Äôs core focus‚Äî tracking fitness/recreational activities
4. UX/UI is very easy to navigate
5. What‚Äôs next? Need to try Strava Premium to see how much more there is to offer.Once you get you bearings and explore all of the avenues this app has to offer, it becomes very beneficial, but most importantly useful. The social media aspect behind it is a perfect balance as well. I reccommend the premium version if your persistent with daily/weekly runs/bikes/walks/hikes/swim etc.Usually people perceive addiction to social media as negative. My addiction to Strava has made me run more and get closer to reaching my goals. I recommend this app to anyone who has or wants to make some friends in the fitness world and also want to improve their physical ability.After 4 years of running ive used multiple apps to track my biking and running. Strava is by far my favorite. I love the social engagement and user interface of the app. Very user friendly and very well put together for the price. Well worth it.Sure, it‚Äôs annoying constantly being asked ‚Äúare you on strava?‚Äù by everyone you meet working out, but the truth is - you should be on Strava. It‚Äôs great. Technologically sturdy, integrates with nearly everything, and the social features are great. Just download it.Strava is the one social network I want to be on right now. Given the shelter in place order here in the Bay Area, Strava has been a huge part of getting me to work out and keeping me motivated this month. I‚Äôve been a premium user for two years and I love it more than ever. Thanks guys. You rock.I never review apps, but I probably like this one the most. I can record my runs, track my progress, and even download my data if I want to. Also, it‚Äôs hard to doomscroll on Strava, so definitely my favorite social media.Strava is the great social media for us athletes who want to improve in our running, biking or any other sport. I love the matched workout features as it shows me how my training is going compared to past weeks or years.Social media for active folks!  

Love so many aspects of Strava. Segments, HR, elevation change, speed, ability to look at trends, comparison in age group, with ""following"" and other sets of folks. 

Wud like one small addition: to be able to categorize separately rides with others (drafting) or alone.Strava is a great tool weather you use it to keep you motivated by socializing or use it to make you stronger by using it to track your stats from your workouts.  Everyone I know and ride with use Strava, that was enough to get me started with Strava and haven‚Äôt regretted it...Love tracking my rides, sharing pics, giving and getting kudos. Strava gets me out there and has helped me met a huge circle of cyclist in the Chicago area, but also, across the world. My most used app. Strava is my only social media.I have always supported Strava, and going Premium was the best decision I made. I not only keep connected with people back home on their runs but can have new connections too! Love to get the runner connections even bigger!!If it didn‚Äôt happen on strava, did it even happen?  I use it for all my running. Good or bad runs, it all gets posted. The social aspect is a lot stronger than most other fitness apps I‚Äôve seen. I wish there was a ‚Äútrail‚Äù surface function though.",0,NYC BDBxappstorereviewwriterggguuideXSunSparcimpunityKrozyRustyFrankCC 184KMarin14CG Utah17 Year Old Hayden S.Delta421LofoluluSamaki KubwaJURASSICWORLD915jtcycilstJohn PackelHopnscratchitKaitlinHPowellcrayzeeeStewart little zzzzseede_MonkeyLordMali H.Crash recover back to myselfTGdude456Puppy BoyUpEarlyEveryDayMikexpetersEpaulterJackson2718Craig Patrick - Idahomsspeaceksbiglermr LynskeyGEHANNGrateful for no PM'sredl1nkRexfestRj101.3rumblestrip66Dont do drugsStay steady Clashinspotify enthousiastdizzytimsAnonymous Calvinamanda gradyDas5099RuthRunner17SoxCeltsHuskiesPatsTulsaCyclejonathan wlodyRandolph2025Will Winn,"Stop and StartLong time user, recently went premiumThe best appI main Strava these daysOne (workout) app to rule them all!Better than the others, worth the moneyHands down best running app!Long time userSo many sweet features!5‚≠êÔ∏è appAmazing app.Pretty good but not perfectBoosted my PerformanceYes!Great app to track my activity!Total recallWorth paying forReliable, accurate, great valueSo great!Inspiring Fitness CompanionThis app is the best!Great, one ask thoughThis is the only social media I can get behindStravaCustomer serviceGreat appMy top social appGreat App with a few tweeks neededFell in love with it.Great App for Runners and BikersStrava has changed my life!ExcellentGreat to motivate and measureBest value of any app I use‚Ä¶not even close!Strava is life...and it's a healthy oneTrauma SafeReally enjoy itBest Fitness AppBest sport app everReassuring and MotvatingOne of the best accountability apps on the marketPerfect Running AppGood AppI‚Äôve used multiple fitness appsBest Running AppLifesaver right nowStrava is a way of lifeMy social media app!Truly well done apKeeping you honestGreat appStravaIt‚Äôs the app",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,2,9,0,0,1,53,10,3,1,0,3844,has_social,174

Then a few years ago after a total knee replacement, I started swimming. I bought a Garmin watch to track my swimming progress and was happy to see that the Garmin watch, used to share this info with the  Strava app on my iPhone and automatically shared this info. It had my swim with all stats right on my iPhone. 
I recently was given an  Apple iwatch as a gift and it has a default Strava app on it. It does not offer a swim tracking option. Furthermore, the Apple default activity  app which I‚Äôve been using for swimming does not automatically share this info with the Strava app and there is no option to do this. 
So, I‚Äôm kind of disappointed since I am ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a few people and would them to see that I am still training. And I would like them to give me the üëç after a swim. Now I have to explain that I‚Äôm using a new watch that doesn‚Äôt offer swimming in the Strava app.  
I suggest the developers figure out how to incorporate swimming in their iwatch app or at least ‚Äúshare‚Äù this info with the Stava app the way Garmin does.I have used Strava for 5 years to track my runs and mountain bike rides, and it has been one of my favorite apps. The features Strava provided in addition to GPS tracking were awesome and over the years have motivated me to become a better athlete. Some of the best features I am referring to are comparing past times and leaderboards. I even wrote an essay in my college Health Promotion class about how good Strava is at motivating people to be healthier and become better athletes. Unfortunately, Strava decided to make these features Subscription-only in the latest update, which greatly disappointed me. I can no longer compare past times or use the leaderboard, which were some of the best features. If Strava is struggling financially, I would gladly put up with a few ads in the app. However, they have decided to make you pay $60 to use the basic features. I hope these recent reviews will help them realize the impact Strava has made in the lives of many athletes and restore the basic free features.You sign up and get the summit membership and enjoy all the bells and whistles until... Next thing you know they drop Bluetooth technology and expect you to pay more money to purchase and use other devices and other companies apps to upload to their own just for some bells and whistles fitness info.  What‚Äôs the point of being a tracking app if you have to rely on other apps heart rate, cadence, and power meter info? Strava shame on you for taking our money and a nice application that was simple and saying screw you to your customers.  Instead of fixing issues they just drop issues and hope more ppl don‚Äôt realize that they‚Äôve done this in the past as well.  So be warned you will like this app at first and sooner or later they will drop the very thing you used and relied on to track rides and fitness and not care how it affects your use of their app because in the end your money is all they care about. Got news for you Strava.  Karma is real and it will get ya back.   Have a nice day!I love the layout of Strava, but it‚Äôs not a great business model to give users features only to slowly take them away (leaderboards, weekly mileage) to try to get them to buy premium. At some point I‚Äôm going to get annoyed enough that we can no longer access simple features like weekly mileage or get tired of the constant pop-ups prompting me to buy premium. There‚Äôs a lot of alternatives on the market (Garmin Connect, RunKeeper, MapMyRun) that offer the same features, so Strava should be capitalizing on the popularity they have and trying to find a way to make that profitable without removing existing (simple, honestly) features, rather than slowly driving people away by trying to force purchase of premium ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è tracking weekly mileage is the bare minimum of a functioning exercise app.Strava used to be really good as a free app. Now with recent updates, they have taken a lot away. Such as building your route, leaderboards and tracking weekly progress. I can no longer go in and view last weeks mileage as of August 15th 2020. What‚Äôs the point of tracking mileage, if you can‚Äôt see previous weeks? I think taking free features away and hiding them behind a paywall is a very poor business model. Shame on you Strava. It‚Äôs not like they came out with new features and charged you for those. Might I make a suggestion as well. Your segments are great, but you should put what that person ran total mileage and total average pace as well. That way you can see who was sniping segments vs the real runners who just took segments while on a normal run.This used to be a great app for logging in and tracking bike rides and runs.  But with every update it gets worse.  Case in point, when I hit record, it tells me it started.  But when I finish it shows as if nothing ever happened, same for the watch extension.  Also, had an incident in which the app wouldn‚Äôt react to any commands, only to execute it an hour later, like it was delayed, it happened with both the phone and watch app.  It happened twice, the second time happened even after I restarted both the phone and the watch‚Ä¶.  I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt paid for a subscription, total disappointment.Having the ability to see your weekly mileage and vert with one click in your profile has been a part of the app for years but it was changed/removed recently.  This was one of the more useful things about the app, and seems like it should be a basic feature of a fitness tracking app.  This seems like more of the silly changes that Strava is making to put things behind a paywall.  I wish they would just use ads so that they could continue to provide a decent free app, rather than charging for features that used to be free.I‚Äôve had Strava for years now and really loved it. With the recent update there‚Äôs basically no reason to use Strava unless you need a simple map/tracking app. I have an Apple Watch so the app is essentially useless to me. I loved the matched runs/leaderboard/other stats. I understand taking away some of the more advanced features but taking away the simple leaderboard feature?? Doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs ironic because I was actually considering the premium version before this left a bad taste in my mouth. Sad to say I will be switching to another app with more features and less pushing of it‚Äôs premium version.I‚Äôve been a user for a couple of years for cycling and running, but am tired of losing my data after an activity. No hint of trouble until activity ends and doesn‚Äôt upload to phone. They interface has also changed on the watch a few times. You‚Äôre always looking for the features/buttons. 

The features of phone app are great (although they do move things around there frequently, too) but I will take less features if it works every time. 

Do not expect this to be as stable as the built in tracking app on the Apple Watch.I paid for a full years subscription and for the first couple rides, the gps worked fine. But now it is trash. I‚Äôm on the most up to date version of the app and on the most current Verizon of iOS but my rides never record. I ride the same route multiple times per week and never have an issue with my watch‚Äôs built in tracking. I‚Äôve reached out to their support teams on social media and via email and no one responds. I learned my lesson‚Äîsave yourself the hassle and find a better tracker.I‚Äôve been a Strava user since 2015, and have enjoyed using the app until this new update. The one thing I loved about the app was being able to compare my segment times to my friends and the other people on that app, as I am a very competitive person. But now you have to pay to see where you stand on the leaderboards, which I think is very stupid. The free app didn‚Äôt offer much other than tracking your distance, time calories, etc. but at least it had leaderboards. Now it doesn‚Äôt even offer that without making you pay. Probably won‚Äôt use the app anymore.It's been more than once I've found the app to have not tracked my run and the statistics are just not reliable! I use my iPhone to track my runs and do not use any run tracking devices. But I've tried all the ways suggested by Strava Support to troubleshoot my phone's GPS and the app just doesn't pick up my position. (I haven't noticed such consistent location errors so far on GMaps)
The frustration at the end of your run, hoping that you'll track your statistics and progress and then you see - 0.5mi run in 38mins! Not a reliable app!!I was just beginning to get hooked Strava and as a casual rider would even pay $2-3/mo. But $60? I‚Äôll put that toward a new dropper post.

The problem is that the app is near worthless relative to other tracking apps without the subscription. I can‚Äôt even see my prior rides to compare times without a subscription. Suggestion  to Strava if they care to keep me or many here
1) keep personal segments and tracking free. Without it, you‚Äôll lose your free base
2) create a mid-tier for basic leaderboards, such as the overall leaderboard and maybe friends. I‚Äôd pay $2 maybe $3 per month
3) create the upper tier with all the fancy leaderboards, deeper analytics, etc. charge $5-10 for those who care enough

This keeps you free base with enough features and history to stay, while monetizing more. Lose the base and your future profits will drop. Best of luckThus used to be a great app. Now it‚Äôs a buggy piece of crap. The fitness calculator is only taking into account my bike rides and disregards my 1900 meters of swimming 3 times a week and my 2 hours of weight training twice a week designating them as recovery times. Thus my fitness scores are taking a nose dive. I‚Äôve tried to contact support 2 times about this a so far ‚Äúcrickets‚Äù.
If this continues, I‚Äôm canceling my subscription and going with Training Peaks. This company got successful, made a lot a money, stopped caring, and let this program go to pot.Absolutely in love with this app and use it daily, but with the recent update the weekly comparisons and tracking have been moved solely to subscription. I do not train nor am planning to join any marathon, but love to bike. I see through the recent reviews that this is a concern for many casual bikers/runners. I hope this specific feature comes back (weekly trackers) as it provides immense motivation to even the most casual athletes, who perhaps do not require any further features. I am deeply discouraged and sad to have seen it go.Strava not only has chosen to remove BLE integration, but the battery drain from GPS tracking has increased. So, now in order to track my activity with heart rate data I need to run Strava, an HR monitor, and music. This latest version accomplished draining my 89% battery in a little over 3 hours! I used to be able to do 5+ hour activities while tracking gps, hr and running the beacon without issue. I‚Äôm cancelling my premium and I guess Strava now gets uninstalled. There is now a huge gap in the market for a developer that can integrate sensors.If you are looking for politics to be inserted into your running, biking & swimming, üëçLOOK NO FUTHER! It used to be that sports was the one place where we could be united because of our passion for them & they are fantastic to escape the world‚Äôs woes, if only for a little while. It seems that Strava does not feel the same way; they would prefer divisive content on an app used for simply tracking fitness. Furthermore, it is disingenuous to excuse 6 months of continuously rioting and burning down American cities (including Washington DC) by one group as ‚Äúpeaceful protests.‚ÄùSo I started using Strava to record my rides/runs and to share them with the Ironman Virtual Club for my virtual competitions (crucial during this COVID sheltering time). Then, Ironman.... NOT Strava.... Ironman, had the courtesy to co tact their athletes to notify us that Strava has decided we cannot share OUR recorded data with Ironman anymore. I can only imagine they want a cut and when they didn‚Äôt get it, they picked up their toys and left the sandbox. And didn‚Äôt even notify their users. Wow. 
So.... f#!* Strava and on to better companies for my tracking/plan purchasing.Hello,

I have a fully up-to-date Series 3 Watch (OS and app version). Every time I finish an activity after the latest release it says my location has not changed and so it can‚Äôt save the activity. This is after running 7+ miles more than once. I know the GPS is working because it‚Äôs accurately tracking my pace and distance.

PLEASE PUSH A FIX ASAP! This is a bug that makes the app actually useless lol, I really would like this valuable data to not be lost every run.Horrible experience. Watch app is too dumb to pause HR and other sensors while you're not moving, so if you take a lunch break on a ride you come back with 15% battery gone. Also, just did a ride from SF to Marin and it thinks I biked across the bay rather than the bridge...clearly didn't record any gps data or it was so sparse it drew a line between two points. 

Awful. Only reason I use this is because my historical data is there. Apple's own outdoor cycle activity tracking is way better.This app was great! Key word was. Ive had it since it came out and never used the subscription because i didnt need the extra features, which were great, that it provided because i have my garmin app. But now with this update theve taken away the most useful features and now want you to pay for something they've provided for free for years. Its ridiculous how they now want you to pay for basic fucntions you get for free on almost any other activity tracking app. Way to drop the ball with corporate greed!I have an Apple Watch 4. I‚Äôve been riding the last week in Germany and France. For some reason whenever I enable this Stava app on my Apple Watch it will not shut down when i am done and close the app. I‚Äôve closed it numerous times and the soon as I do it shows up again draining my battery. I thought this might be because the Strava app was turned on my iPhone. Not the case. So for now I have deleted the app from my Apple Watch and just use my iPhone for tracking my routes.This is a social media app with some fitness metrics. Overall the app is great for tracking and sharing fitness activities. However, it is NOT worth the large price increase for a subscription to a social media app to share you activities. My Garmin and Apple Health do it for free and provide WAY more insight into my workouts. Save your money and time, use the free version if you want to share, use something else to track fitness metrics.I really want to like this app. I‚Äôve heard great things about Strava, but I‚Äôm getting really fed up with the customer support. Nothing but issues for the past month with the app. I have multiple open cases with no response regarding tracking issues, and They keep closing all my tickets without ever answering me. I‚Äôve been all over the forums and many people appear to have been having the same problems for years, so I know this isn‚Äôt an easy problem that I‚Äôm overlooking. What‚Äôs the deal?If you are an active person and enjoy tracking your miles, I would highly recommend to move on from this app and go to Nike running app or something else. This app tracked my first 10 or 15 runs and now won‚Äôt log any more. There could be a glitch of maybe I have to pay for more miles but if you want consistency, I would keep searching for a different app. You never know if Strava will record it for the future or not. Thanks for reading.The app was hands down the best way to track miles and compare yourself to friends or other people. Many months have gone by were I‚Äôve been tracking KOM‚Äôs and training for them but with the new update it‚Äôs no longer possible to unless you pay to see the comparative times. Making it really obsolete just so they can make a quick buck really upset about this hopefully it reverts to how it was or I will find one that does track segments for free.I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times in hopes if getting it to synch with my Apple Watch. It is hung up on the Motion and Fitness setting. It is all very straightforward as this process should be, then a dead end! It would be nice to be able to look at my watch during activities to see my progress as it is tracking. When will this be fixed? It isn‚Äôt the sign of a great app that a user has to comb through forums for workarounds for bugs!Sadly I‚Äôve decided to leave Strava.  The idea is great and the gamification of segments and tracking is an awesome feature but since the beginning of the year the GPS signal just drops and all your data for a run isn‚Äôt recorded (making the gamification pretty useless).

I submitted a number of reports on the app indicating the mileage is wrong but as of yet nothing has improved. Routes that I know are 4 miles long consistently come in at 3.5 and randomly sometimes will reach 4. I could understand some differential run to run but not that much. I‚Äôve noticed that the app often doesn‚Äôt start tracking my run until I‚Äôm well into it. Recently I‚Äôve been double checking to make sure that it says gps acquired before starting my run and even waiting a couple of seconds after hitting start to begin...still nothing. It‚Äôs really frustrating to have chunks of mileage taken off. Clearly the algorithms know there‚Äôs a problem because during my run the automated time announcement will say one time and when I finish the app has somehow adjusted it to a different time. I don‚Äôt get how the time adjusts but not the mileage. I may consider returning to MapMyRun since I experienced fewer issues.Strava was the best tracking app for the past 5-6 year until someone decide that it was a good idea to take all the functions away for the loyal ‚Äúnot premium users‚Äù, this is Lame.  On top of this you removed all subscriptions tiers??? I guess my thought is if you intended to make the best app ever with all the free options, only to make this subscription only after 6 years, why not just start the app as pay subscription. Oh I know because you would have never grown to millions of users! You thought a better strategy was millions of users world wide love your so much that when you decide its time to collect for your app the users will be so hooked they will be leveraged into paying to keep there same level of enjoyment with their friends, good call. 

Anyway as stated above just really disappointed with the strategy and execution, especially now when we can‚Äôt ride with our friends but we could at least share the joy of a ride. Hope you right the wrong!Strava does the most basic functions of workout tracker fairly well. Interface is easy to use and I really enjoy the popular segment feature.

There are however some pretty normal features Strava does not support or incorporate. 
For example: Most of my workouts I‚Äôm not so much concerned about my mile pace as just seeing my total workout and total time spent running. However, Strava even after turning the autopause feature off does server side autopause no matter what unless you also mark a workout as a race. Why? Turning autopause off should be enough to not give me any autopauses. 

Another biggie is adding manual workouts. Too often especially in the winter in sub 30¬∞ weather my phone dies so I need to go in and add a manual workout afterwards. However, Strava does not support mapped manual workouts. You can only add total distance and time worked out into a manual workout. Why? If I knew my distances without a tracking app I wouldn‚Äôt use a tracking app. A simple map tool to add the route I ran and calculating the distance for me seems pretty basic.

I deleted Strava after their most recent update completely bricked the app for iOS 11.2.5 users and it‚Äôs been 4 days since that and their has been no new update to fix the issue. That‚Äôs unacceptable for an app that most of us use daily. Way too many other run trackers out there for me to wait a week for Strava to get the app unbricked.Strava is a pretty good app but it really took a huge step backwards by eliminating Bluetooth sensor connections. You used to be able to connect a heart rate sensor or any other sensor directly through Strava and the data would feed into your activity (after paying for Premium).  
  This is no longer possible. Now you have to use another app to record sensor data (I use Wahoo) and then upload it to Strava. One catch is if you want to send a tracking Beacon (after paying Premium) you have have Strava and Wahoo open. Why do I have to use two apps to accomplish what one app used to do? 
  When I finish a ride I have to upload my Wahoo ride to Strava and then delete my Strava ride (or else it will double count your activity) then I have to edit the Wahoo ride. 
  Now I have multiple more steps just to record a ride. 
  So this basically ruined a good app. Strava please fix this and stop taking things away and saying the app is better!I have heard so much about Strava over the years, but was reluctant to add it bc I already track my runs so many ways - MapMyRun to share with friends, Nike+ Run Club for my lifetime running totals, achievements, and coached runs, and Garmin watch. I added Strava bc a virtual race I‚Äôm doing requires it and I thought I‚Äôd try it for a month of regular use with the free subscription. While I like the social aspects of this and the training data (still trying to learn what it all means!), there are several disappointing aspects that I can‚Äôt get past:
 - can‚Äôt use help/support feature in app (it repeatedly tells me to first confirm my email, I do, nothing changes)
 - can‚Äôt edit a run
 - can‚Äôt add shoes from the app, and can‚Äôt start shoes from the number of miles they already have
 - the training plan feature is absolutely bare bones. There is zero customization and no option for coached runs (fartlek, anyone?)
 - GPS tracking is wildly discrepant from my Garmin watch, which I‚Äôve used for years. Adds anywhere from .15-.2 mi extra distance on runs from 3-5mi in length. That‚Äôs a huge difference. It makes me look like I‚Äôm much faster than I am, but it gives me false PRs. Not cool, Strava. 

Bottom line for me: MMR and NRC do these things better and most of them for free. NRC is definitely the best value, even if Nike is constantly trying to sell me stuff.I used to love strava but the most recent update has taken away the most basic and essential function of the app, tracking your weekly miles. Seriously?!? I get that they want to try to push the premium subscription but taking away this feature essentially forced everyone‚Äôs hand by making the app essentially useless without the subscription. With everything going on in the world right now Strava is just exploiting the situation and forcing everyone to pay for the most basic things and it‚Äôs not right. I am extremely disappointed by how aggressive they are becoming with their premium venture. If the subscription was cheaper I‚Äôd consider it but the way they are going about it is so frustrating that I‚Äôm just going to go somewhere else since it doesn‚Äôt seem to any other choice, there essentially is no free version now.I was looking for an app to simply map my bike trips, just to see where I travelled.  Strava was the top choice and it seemed to fit the bill.  

The free version comes with lots of opportunities to purchase a subscription and follow other people.  After finishing my rides and ending tracking on the app, I wasn‚Äôt able to look at my previous routes later.  

Of course, I can view everything with a subscription, which I‚Äôm not willing to do.  I don‚Äôt see the advantage of a subscription in my situation.  If you enjoy any of the supported activities and want to brag about yourself or be inspired by others bragging about themselves, then maybe.  The app is basically useless without a subscription, and shouldn‚Äôt be advertised it as free.When I first started using the app it was only minor distance problems, like if I wanted to run a 1.5mile run then I‚Äôd have to run an extra .1 or .2 miles. But I just ran 2.5 miles and it only registered as 2, for someone who runs for time and a score a half mile is a ridiculous difference for a timed run. Idk if using WiFi or not makes a difference but that much of a difference pretty much makes the app useless. It‚Äôs a shame because I love every other aspect of this app. Being able to join clubs, share runs with your friends and join challenges makes running more interesting and fun. However, at the end of the day an accurate tracking system is what I‚Äôm looking for in an app like this.I have been a Strava premium member for several years, and I have loved all that it offers. It had everything I wanted and worked great. Recently, however, Strava removed Bluetooth compatibility with the app making it useless for tracking activities if you want to use HR monitor, cadence monitor, etc. You now have to use a separate app and import into Strava to use its analytics and social aspect. This is unacceptable! Why should I pay a premium price for an app that isn‚Äôt fully functional and can‚Äôt stand on its own? Strava needs to drastically reduce its price or fix the issue. To give a lame excuse, remove functionality, and expect me to keep paying the same price is ridiculous. If they can‚Äôt fix the problem, I will move on to something else.I never write reviews, but I‚Äôm so incredibly disappointed in Strava in the past month. They took almost every single moderately useful feature of the app and put it behind a paywall without a word of warning. 
I guess it‚Äôs still nice to see an aggregate of my workouts, but no longer can you compare segments to your friends or track your progress. 
Not sure why they thought this was a good idea, but I‚Äôm going to be trying to find an alternative to this because that‚Äôs just bad form. What gets me is that they had a whole array of features that you had to pay for that helped with training, which I don‚Äôt use, so it seems reasonable that those would be premium. Tracking your progress across time should not be a premium feature.I've mainly used strava for tracking my runs, see pace, distance, etc. Strava is great for that and offers a social aspect where you can see friends activity, although I've never used it. Recently though it completely broke for me, I'm getting a 403 on everything except recording a run which means I can't save the stats or compare with previous runs. I've tried redownloading to no avail. Support articles on the issue are nonexistent.  There isn't a way for me to log out either, the bottom menu is screwed up so the icons overlap. Not sure whats happening but pretty disappointed. Apps have bugs, but this completely broke the app to the point that I can't even log out to fix it.I really like the social aspect of this app and have enjoyed the fitness tracking. But as I‚Äôve improved and try to compare my performance with previous rides I can see how inaccurate the tracking is. 
I frequently ride the same exact route to track my progress but have found the data to be so inaccurate as to be useless. I first noticed when it said I climbed 1500 feet and I know that hill was 900 the last time.  Other times it recorded it as little as 600 feet. 
Timing in segments is way off too. While trading with other riders, my stats were slower when I clearly finished the segment faster. 
IDK if it‚Äôs the phone, the satellites or the app but I wouldn‚Äôt pay for extra features.I use this primarily because I have a Peloton bike.  It‚Äôs OK but there are some definite issues with the app that would cause me to abandon it if not for the Peloton. 

First - it does not automatically synchronize with my apple activity app.  To get it to upload to the activity app after a bike ride is completed, I must go into the Strava App, go into the workout I just completed and review all data.  Only then will it push the workout to the Apple activity app and give me credit for the workout. 

Second - Once the above is done it double pushes the activity to the Apple activity app.  So every workout I complete on Strava shows up two times on apple activity.  Not exactly accurate tally of what I am doing.  

I use Map My Run for all of my other activity tracking and would probably switch to this app if it weren‚Äôt for these annoying issues.  I run, bike and use the peloton.  The only reason I use this app now is because of the integration with the Peloton.  It would be nice if these issues were fixed so it worked seamlessly, and pushed accurate data to the activity app.I don't get it‚Äîwhy does everyone rave about this app? It's okay, but it has less than half of the useful features of MyMyFitness. For instance, the voice feedback is a joke. You get your choice of splits and... nope, that's it. You can get splits at every mile or every half mile. Contrast that with MapMyFitness, which gives you seven options and eight interval choices at either distances or times. What about coaching? Forget it. Paying for premium is a total ripoff. There isn't even a delayed start option. Maybe the social media aspect is more appealing to some people, but UA has that covered too. There's just no question‚Äîwhen it come to fitness tracking, Strava can't compete.I like the features Strava has to offer, but the app‚Äôs GPS stops working half the time I use it. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I‚Äôm running. This happens in multiple locations (I was originally thinking it was a poor signal issue). But I started using Runkeeper, while also using Strava, just in case it stopped tracking, and the other running app doesn‚Äôt stop tracking when Strava does. Either Strava will save I‚Äôve run zero km/miles or it will only register a small portion of the route. Ive seen others in my feed complain about this as well. What is going on?I have been using strava so much throughout this year to help me train with my cross county team. It is one of the best running apps out there and it really makes non runners like my mom want to get the virtual badges. I ran into this problem a while ago and I noticed it when I went running and it said it was tracking my run but it wouldn‚Äôt show where I‚Äôve been or tracked my distance, which make my runs very annoying because I wouldn‚Äôt know my splits or my distance/pace. It is a bug i found but maybe for others it doesn‚Äôt affect them. I have re downloaded the app so hopefully it changesStrava is not properly tracking my runs. I have asked for advice via email, social media etc. no customer service. I run 25 minutes it says I ran 20 minutes. I run 3 mile it says I ran 2 miles. I hate to give a poor review and wouldn‚Äôt have, but the app just asked me to rate my experience. Poor customer service. It asks me to upgrade and I would probably consider it if there was any customer service to get the app fixed. I have tried to delete and re download and many other things. 

I know my other friends love it and I used to love it.The Strava team took one of the few good features of Strava which was the only feature I used, km tracking for rowing, out of the free version and made it a premium feature. I like many others are students who do not always have the luxury of paying for subscription services and am disappointed to see my once favorite tracking app follow suit with so many others subscription based companies. As an entrepreneur I understand that this is a strategy to generate revenue, but from a consumer standpoint it is a disappointment. Time to go back to the excel document for tracking.Longtime (free) Strava user here. I‚Äôm a recreational rider who rides 3-4 times a week and always liked to track my segments and performances throughout the year. All of the other premium features were not enough for me to warrant an actual paid subscription. So what do the owners of Strava decide to do in the middle of a Worldwide pandemic? Decontent the free app and try and squeeze a few more bucks out of the millions of loyal users. Segment history: GONE. Basic Leaderboard stats: GONE. Great job Strava. Hate to do it, but I‚Äôll be testing out new tracking apps as an alternative. Reason...pure spite.Lots of my friends have this all and I like the social aspect of it. I tried the free trial for their paid service and the data was useful. 

However, my pet peeve is when 3rd party apps don‚Äôt work properly on iOS. That‚Äôs the case with Strava. The syncing from the iOS Health app is atrocious. 

Initially I would manually upload my workouts. I‚Äôd get a notification that it was ready and then I could upload. 

Eventually I switched to auto and that‚Äôs when the trouble started. 

Now my workouts don‚Äôt sync. Deleted and reinstalled. Updated. Nothing. 

Since I track workouts with the Fitness app and my Apple Watch, I don‚Äôt use the tracking in Strava. So, since the app won‚Äôt sync the data from my Health app, I have zero need for it. 

It‚Äôs too bad because I really, really enjoyed the social aspect as well as the insights with the subscription.I used strava for a couple of months before deciding to upgrade to premium and let me tell you it is NOT WORTH IT.

As a free mileage and route tracker, strava performs as well as any other cycling app with the added semi-benefit of a social media style feed which no one really interacts with in a serious way. 

Upgrading to premium offers several benefits, none of which are actually that enticing. The main feature is being able to map your heart rate and caloric burn rate against other variables for each ride. 

What made me cancel my subscription is how poor the HR tracking actually is. There are huge flat spots and unexplained cliffs (example: going up a hill and strava says my HR is around 100bpm) on my charts consistently. This translates to returning home from a ride with a huge discrepancy in how much work you‚Äôve actually put in vs what strava tells you.

100% not worth the exorbitant subscription price.I‚Äôve used Strava for three years now and was genuinely impressed with the app for the first year or so. Starting roughly a year and a half ago, the quality of the app has started to slide and has only gotten worse. It seems that after every update, there are tracking issues or something that just doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs frustrating and I‚Äôm not renewing for the next year. Seems like I can use the native Apple app and not have to pay for the same level of service.I feel the accuracy when tracking with apple products are very inaccurate. When I ride with friends I should not show 4 additional miles. I did not wander off and disappear for 4 miles without someone noticing. The accuracy I feel keeps getting worse with every update. Can you fix this so my friends don‚Äôt feel bad they didn‚Äôt ride as long as me? I also feel that the tracks look like I ride drunk. The trails aren‚Äôt wide enough to make that many micro turns.Shoe tracking is awful at actually allocating the runs to your shoes. The miles seem to disappear when you change from the required default shoe to a different shoe. Useless and unreliable feature. Paid subscribers should be able to look at all sorts of data by shoe as well. And why in the heck can you only add shoes on the website and not the app. On a mobile the website automatically sends you to the app so adding a shoe becomes unnecessarily difficult. Not worth paying for!This app is great for tracking and all but I‚Äôm here for creating routes and it‚Äôs an absolute joke. It‚Äôs terrible. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong but it‚Äôs becoming really inconvenient. It automatically makes the route go around all over the place instead of going 5 feet in front of the last point. So instead of having a 5 mile straight line it will create 20 mile backtracking going all around different roads type of trip. I don‚Äôt care for that. Why is google maps better?I loved it for YEARS until they got rid of the capability of tracking my heart rate with my Bluetooth headphones‚Äô heart rate sensor. I absolutely hate strap or wrist type monitors. It‚Äôs a deal breaker IMO. They say you can use wahoo and upload the data to Strava but why would I do that when other tracking apps do almost everything strava does and utilize my current heart rate monitor? I guess I‚Äôll have to switch to Runkeeper until they decide (IF they ever decide) to support them again. :-/The way Strava is laid out and works, it would be my favorite of the running tracker apps, but so frequently are my distances and time wrong that it makes it not very useful if I were overly concerned with accurate tracking. Frequently it doesn‚Äôt track my run almost at all, or will stop mid-run, or often will think I took a different route than I did and attribute me more or less mileage during a run.I use this app for basics - tracking distance and a rough pace of my run while running. 4 out of my last 5 runs have omitted at least 0.25 mile, which might not sound like much, but completely throws off my pace when I‚Äôm only running a few miles. At first, it was just at the start. This time, I ran 1.1 miles down a trail and somehow only clocked 0.6 on the way back. Very frustrating.For the last few weeks the GPS tracking has been off. During the run the tracking counter for distance doesn‚Äôt register for half the run. After ending the run and recording the results it is far from accurate. .25 to over a mile off. I don‚Äôt run on parallel roads but more encircling a neighborhood so it shouldn‚Äôt get confused by crossing my previous path. 
Please fix! It was a great and very accurate run tracker before.Overall I‚Äôve been quite pleased with Strava. I‚Äôve been a user for the better part of ten years. I recently bought a Wahoo TICKR heart rate monitor strap, as I‚Äôd like to start training with heart rate zones. Unfortunately the newest version of the Strava app on my iPhone no longer supports external heart rate sensors. I contacted customer service, and they confirmed this. Come on Strava, this is very disappointing from the leader of fitness and activity tracking!",0,Crog801use.to.love.yur.appxgravity23ModifiedAngelLateLifeRunnerGirlCBRAliCarl & TamiRU_1958jtw575corbe6NanakslBonist gnevardPedeclaudoPc2013PcAcai-isaiahyou asked 123University Rowercrankwerks86The Talented Mr. Maconi r joeHwinekofixtheapp2022Oak ForstJordan MarkleyWillRaichIJustWantToPostMyReviewmusikloverrRyGuy206Capt.

I just want something for free and can track my rides with elevation profiles and speed. Strava seems to do that and a lot more, especially ads that keeps hounding you to upgrade to the premium version. Cool thing is that it can record your movements with GPS and can be set up with privacy in mind. Here are a bunch of thing that bug me about this app:
1) the Feed is kind of confusing sometimes. It takes sometime to get use to on what is what, especially the stupid ads are mixed in.
2) the header part of the app where you have links or buttons. They're hard to press and a lot of the times, the don't work. A good example is the bell on the Feed. You have to press it numerous times or just let your thumb sit there for a few seconds to get you to a notification screen. 
3) settings and other setups require so many steps to set up the app or to start a recording process.
I wish there's a non-paid app without any advertisements that can give you GPS tracking on a map with speed and elevation without all the bloated crap that comes with Strava. To bad there's none out there at the moment.Wanted to find an alternative app for tracking my running miles (and the occasional bike ride) and decided to give strava a try. When I first downloaded the app, I still had access to leaderboards and all that jazz, but since then Strava has thrown the subscription model at its users like so many others. ($60 a year is pretty wild if you ask me). Although I was bummed, I still enjoyed the challenges and still preferred the overall interface over Nike‚Äôs. However, over the past few months I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing an uptick in the amount of runs that don‚Äôt get tracked properly. I can‚Äôt tell you how frustrating it is to finish a long run, only to get back and look at Strava saying I‚Äôve only run 2.8 miles. Like what?? Sometimes the app won‚Äôt even track my movement at all during a run and I‚Äôll find myself on the sidewalk messing with my phone trying to close out of the app to reset it, and at times that doesn‚Äôt even fix the issue. I would rather not go back to using Nike‚Äôs app (for reasons I won‚Äôt go into), but at least their gps tracking system is solid. Strava if you see this, please address this issue. (Currently on iPhone X)The social aspect of the biking got me to use this instead of MapMyRide. I love the badges and how motivational it is to beat your PRs and place in the top 10s. However, this thing is SEVERELY glitched. Granted, I‚Äôm using an iPhone and I keep it in my under saddle zip bag (could affect tracking?), but the times are heinously inaccurate. They have guys getting .03 seconds for a trail segment that‚Äôs 1/4 mile long, IN THE WOODS, on single track between trees. This isn‚Äôt even paved, and it‚Äôs physically impossible for a human to get those times, or even finish it in .10s for that matter. There are multiple people logging these ridiculous times. It‚Äôs important for me to know how I‚Äôm actually doing relative to the truth rather than fictional, glitched data. Completely deflates me when I put in maximum effort, easily clock under .30s on a trail segment and it reads 1:54!? I know I‚Äôm in the woods, but it‚Äôs absurd that in 2019 this data can‚Äôt be tracked with the utmost accuracy through some tree cover on a perfectly clear day. The features are really fun, but if the data can‚Äôt be trusted, this app is no better than a calorie counter.Very disappointed to see the focus of Strava move from a community based fitness app to a profit driven cash grab. Maybe I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic here but the reality is I don‚Äôt have money kicking around for a Strava subscription. I accept that there are going to be aspects of the app that I won‚Äôt have access to, however I would maintain that to this point the [free] app was of 5 star quality and a must have workout tracker. After the update is an entirely different story, however. The free app has been stripped to the bare bones, no more access to segment leaderboards...I can‚Äôt even view my own previous times on segments. Honestly I leave a 3 star rating because I have loved using Strava for the past few years, in reality I should really leave a 1 star review. If you are able to afford the cost of a subscription to Strava, then by all means, it is a great app that is a fun and useful tool for tracking your workouts...BUT, I would not personally recommend the app as it currently stands unless you don‚Äôt have any other option available.Love this app in many ways, but I wish it had better swim tracking.   I wish it had:
- open swim
- lap swim
- a setting for when you are wearing flippers 
- the ability to tap your iWatch when you completed a lap
- pregnancy mode 

It was also very hard to figure out how to get it to display detailed heart rate data.  Even my husband who uses Strava a lot and is a software engineer involved in UI design couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  

It‚Äôs a solid app, but it could use some better UI and improvements with certain sports.  Seems heavily rotated towards biking & running with not enough attention on swimming.   Wish they would purchase or parter with a better swim app like MySwimPro to get better swim data.  

Extra extra cool would be better integration of tides, swells, currents, and weather data for open swimmers.  In 2022, 12 people died near me open swimming and I wonder if apps like this could help people make more informed decision when making choices.  Strava could also advertise safety gear like a $20 swim buoy to open water swimmers.   Perhaps even with Strava logo on it‚Ä¶it could save lives.

Also wish it were easier to connect with other people doing my sports in the area.   Surprised the social aspect is so focused on existing friends.   Seems like a nice way to connect with others.  

Also wish it were easier to become aware of in-person competitions, races, clubs, and training opportunities.If autopause is on, it immediately pauses if I‚Äôm walking.  That means I have to disable autopause if I‚Äôm tracking a hike or run/walk/run type training, so I‚Äôm always having to go back into the settings and switch it back and forth. I‚Äôve lost tracking on parts of my routes because of this.
I don‚Äôt understand why autopause isn‚Äôt sensitive enough to track walking/stopping.  Other apps seem to handle this just fine.
Units and splits: why does the display only show tenths of miles and not hundredths?  Maybe since this started as a biking app, 1/10 of a mile made sense, but as a runner I think more in terms of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 mile distances for pace training.  I am unable to do this on strava because it doesn‚Äôt display the data (that it is already gathering), and because there is no way to select a different option for audio feedback frequency (like every 1/4 mile).
So, there are many things to like about the app, but the bottom line is that it has limited usefulness and versatility for training.4 stars for the phone app - has tracking for many activities. 
2 stars for the watch app - should mirror tracking options of the main app. 

It is frustrating that the watch app does not offer the same tracking options as the phone app. The watch has options for bike rides, runs, & hikes, but pretty much every other activity is excluded from the watch app. Everything else is generically lumped into the ‚Äúworkout‚Äù option, which has no way to track speed or distance. This means that if you want to track anything other than heart rate and workout time for an activity that isn‚Äôt a run or bike ride using your watch, you will have to bring your phone to do so. üòï This is disappointing since this is one of the few apps that will track roller (inline) skating. 
Also, there should be some way to integrate the heart rate features from the watch into the phone app, which apparently only works with third party heart monitors.I have always used other apps in the past for tracking activities but I primarily moved over to Strava for integrations like Charity Miles where I can track things but also do it for charity while still having visibility on stats for me. I think Strava is great at the basics and I have loved being able to do work outs with people and how easy it is to include others so you don‚Äôt both have to track the same route.

All that being said I have struggled with the interface both app and online in understanding how to see certain stats or PR times. From taking time I have found some of the things but it‚Äôs not as straight forward as other tools I have used. Maybe it‚Äôs behind the premium paywall but I do miss things from other apps but again the charity miles integration is keeping me here.I paid to have a subscription with Strava 10 years ago because I wanted them to be around for the cycling community and be successful.  I have to be honest, I‚Äôve been disappointed with their lack of consideration for the very people they originally intended to serve.  They erased all segments on Zwift, very disappointing.  They thought they were doing everyone a favor, they didn‚Äôt.  They erased or decided not to let you track your times or segments against other fellow club members.  They did away with annual best KOM / QOM‚Äôs.  I guess some riders either complained or had fragile egos, whatever.  Strava is downgrading to the point of ‚Äúmy ride‚Äù or other gps tracking apps.  It started out as a no nonsense app for competitive cyclists.  Now it seems as though they don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings.  It‚Äôs too bad, they had a good thing.Ive used Strava for about 4 years and its been excellent, very happy with both running and biking activities.  But all of a sudden ver 58 and 59 the GPS tracking basically doesnt work.  I‚Äôll start an activity, it will record my time for the whole duration, but misses half of the distance traveled (ive only been running recently).  The weird thing today, before i saved my activity the map preview actually showed the whole route even though the distance was wrong, but then when i saved it the map changed to a completely different path.  Please fix the app and ill be happy to change my review to 5 stars (if thats possible)!Unlike many other users I just recently (in April) started using Strava and it has been a great tracking app for all of my walks and runs. I hadn‚Äôt become familiar with all of the great features that are now being taken away in the free version. My frustration is that in the past five days since the most recent update I have lost two runs that were not saved. There is nothing more crushing than to end your run with the excitement of seeing your stats only to have it disappear as though it never happened when I know it was recording during the activity! It was a great app until now it‚Äôs not!I installed this app on the recommendation from a friend, and I use it in conjunction with a Garmin Watch...specifically, Fenix 3 HR.  I‚Äôve been doing a lot of treadmill runs these days, and the Garmin isnt tracking the mileage accurately, and there‚Äôs no function for treadmill runs on Strava, so I have to go in manually and adjust the numbers thru Garmin post-run.  Well, it doesn‚Äôt appear that there‚Äôs any way to adjust my numbers(mainly distance)on Strava, and they are immediately transferred from Garmin pre-Adjustment. So, all my numbers on Strava are incorrect, rendering the app useless for me.  Can this functionality be added?  Am I missing something?  Thanks.Don‚Äôt get me wrong this app is well thought out and is a quality app and performers like a tracking app should. I‚Äôve moved from mapmyrun to Strava thinking this app would offer something more. I like the personal record metals and live tracking on other users, but I don‚Äôt like how easy it has been to mess my tracking and not be able to enter manually or pre-calculate my distance in order to continue tracking my progress. If you pay for this app it would be nice to set up a group class for beginners to experts cyclists and win local prizes etc.I love strava, found it to replace the Nike+ running app that was poor at tracking. I even have paid for Summit. However, while I would have given Strava a 10 out of 5 two months ago, it‚Äôs a 3/5 now. 7 of my last 23 runs have had gps, syncing, or other issues that have inaccurately recorded my workout. Of the 7/23, the last 2 have failed epic-ly. The last being a 2.7ish mile run where the gps failed, heart rate tracker failed, and time failed. Only mileage number was relatively accurate. I‚Äôm going to give it one more try before switching run keeper apps.While I consider Strava to be the best activity tracking social media platform on the market, it can still be better. The ability to group pedal assist rides with normal rides or as a stand alone heatmap would be super nice because the user workaround is to define a pedal assist ride as a normal ride which I‚Äôm certain aggravates users focused on segments. Another improvement would be to search ride history by bike ridden. 

Remember, if you don‚Äôt continue to improve a product or service, it‚Äôs fairly certain your competitors will catch and or pass you. 

From a happy user looking to help.Like the app, have used it off and on for a couple of years, but the gps often cuts out and makes weird jagged lines instead of following my course. Not sure why it does that but it messes up tracking my activity a bit. Also, I really want the option of choosing who I‚Äôd like to share that I joined a challenge with. I don‚Äôt like that it notifies everyone every time I join something and want a way to keep it from automatically posting that.Problems again, but I did have a good 3 months of proper tracking. Not it‚Äôs split between being pretty close to accurate, to completely crazy & all over the place. I still want to use this app, but it‚Äôs getting harder & harder to support it, since it‚Äôs become so temperamental & hard to trust. I will be trying out alternate apps now...

Old 1* review;
For the last 5 months or so, with a few days here and there of working properly, Strava or iPhone has been unable to properly keep track of my distance. It just goes crazy & puts random lines all over the place. It was a 5 Star app, but lately its just been a disappointment. Made walking not so much fun. Fix it & you‚Äôll get your 5 Star back.

Old 5* review:
I use this app daily, but I can't run. I have to use the run option for it to keep up with my miles daily / yearly. Wish there was an option to change this.I use Strava for cycling and kayaking and it tracks well but when I use it for swimming, hah! I swim in an outdoor lap pool at the park, but Strava shows me tracking all over the park! Also, it shows me swimming 3,450 yards at 49 seconds per 100 yards when I only swam 1,500 yards at 1 minute, 50 seconds per 100 yards. Maybe Strava is trying to make me feel better than I am! Guys at Strava, please fix this major flaw! I have the full year paid subscription. Do I need to go to another app developer like myswimpro to get accurate stats?Lately when synching Strava activities with Apple fitness I‚Äôm losing calories - if eg I bike most of the day I end up with hours of workout and a mere 200 cal to show for it even though before the sync I had closed my rings on Apple fitness & had 800 cal! I‚Äôve tried everything; delete / reinstall, look up ideas on community boards‚Ä¶ Nada. I love Strava but will have to stop using it. Not sure what to do because apple watch won‚Äôt last 5-6 hrs of activity tracking. Meeh‚Ä¶Loved this app at first. It was tracking well and I like the community aspect. The last few weeks though it won‚Äôt track my mileage - even if I wait for a strong gps signal. Sometimes it starts partway through my run and sometimes it never tracks distance. I‚Äôve tried updating, restarting my phone, messing with the settings but nothing works. I might switch back to Runkeeper if this doesn‚Äôt get fixed ASAPBeen using Strava for years, almost everyday recently. But will def be going back to free after a $20 price increase for PRO! That‚Äôs a 35% price hike. Not worth it, I was mainly only using PRO for live tracking, but found out you can do that via garment or other apps. Disappointed Strava is just another company raising their prices without doing anything to earn it. The app hasn‚Äôt really changed in years or gotten marginally better.Although I‚Äôd love to think I hiked 6.27 miles in 2.5 hours, it just didn‚Äôt happen! Lol. If I zoom in on the map, it shows spots that look like I ran wildly in zigzag circles before continuing on the trail. I hiked closer to 4.8 miles- so...could this be fixed? It‚Äôs not the first instance - and I see it on others maps too. :)
Otherwise, I do like the concept, but, if the tracking isn‚Äôt accurate, I‚Äôm not going to continue with the app.At one time Strava was a great tool for tracking my exercise walks. It‚Äôs so sad that it‚Äôs owners decided to make one of the main features I liked, the monthly activity comparison, a premium feature. Replacing it is a weekly activity summary, which is worthless to me, as it does not consider walking to be an activity and so has remained at zero. 
I‚Äôm now looking for a replacement for Strava.Strava is a wonderful app for tracking workouts, but the new update forces users to change from viewing their miles/kilometers to viewing the amount of time they have worked out on the profile screen. Why isn‚Äôt there a preference option for this? Also, I am a runner, and Strava always defaults to biking. Why isn‚Äôt there an option to change your preferred sport?Love the app for fitness tracking. The FB mimicry is disappointing. I liked strava bc it was less garbled and less like the other social networks. I get you‚Äôre trying to increase engagement. Then come up with something unique, rather than just miming FB/IG. And, last thing: the paywall gobbling up an increasing number of features is a bummer. That is all.I used to give this app a 5 star rating for everything. But with the newest update they took away rankings unless you subscribe. Look everything is subscription now. It‚Äôs getting old. The segment tracking was part of the draw, now I have to pay? Even though I‚Äôve been using this for years with the base app? Come on people!I am still getting used to the Strava‚Äôs novelty as I am pretty old school when it comes to tracking fitness levels.  It seems to me that the Strava app and Strava Insights should be merged into one app. 

I rated this three stars because there is no iPad version that will allow you to read Strava in landscape mode with a keyboard.   I have to login via Safari/Chrome to use Strava with an iPad.It would be nice if the app allowed for activity tracking in increments of .00 instead of .0. I left some feedback for the devs about this a while ago, but didn‚Äôt see any update. Other than that, this app is more reliable than the Nike app. But I may go back to it because at least on there the miles are tracked more accurately.Using it to track a run the mileage is consistently lower than the Apple workout app or the Nike run app. It‚Äôs not a ton lower but it‚Äôs always lower. Shoe tracking is terrible and inaccurate at best. If you share a run, the person you shared it with ends up with lower mileage and sometimes a higher duration which doesn‚Äôt make any sense and messes up their pace.",0,CSharpsterornellagreghouse_of_ALTSNSH86Nerea007Melting clocksrestless rollerobeansavkhammerjdhsuiwbwhdhdilappsp1Gap Tracklost7spiritstcherry44Blackpass55Bri¬°iJason SimpsonWish2017ailevertemwgttCMRstar430Kelley66davet1959Caleb BurkeyJust want easy mobile depositMatthew D.

3,pos,2022-12-16 06:58:04,"While I love that in Strava I can share my runs with friends and my coach while doing challenges, I have noticed that they like to slowly take away the things you can do without buying their overpriced subscription. I have to say that I joined when segment leaderboards were still all free, routes were free, and you got a year in review of your activities at the end of the year. This was great, made me love the app, but since then it has become an app that only lets you see top overall on a segment and men and women best times. It has also made it necessary to pay for the ability to use the number of routes freely created by other users and inputted into their database. And finally very recently they made the Year in Sport exclusive to subscribers. In the end it is just a Facebook for sharing activities and adding up numbers. Many other tracking apps have uh more available for free than Strava. Just know if you want to make sure you will always have access to something on the app, but the subscription.

Strava fails to save my selection for mileage alert‚Ä¶ I keep trying to select my preferred mileage alert (for a pair of runners, for example) and save it‚Ä¶ but every time I go back in to look at the gear via ‚Äúedit item‚Äù it either shows a completely random number (that I never selected) or fails to show a mileage alert? I feel this feature has been falsely advertised if you download the app to find you cannot even use it appropriately. I am pretty loyal to MapMyRun as it has my entire history logged plus it syncs to MyFitnessPal‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather not have to download an additional app (like ‚ÄúGearTracking‚Äù) just to keep track of my shoe mileage‚Ä¶ I liked that Strava works like MapMyRun (without media limits) combined with GearTracking‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm annoyed the gear tracking is acting buggy and doesn‚Äôt offer as much as the GearTracking app (ie consideration of prior mileage, pie chart progress graph on gear mileage, etc.) Not sure if I will continue using Strava as a result? Minus 1 star for a buggy gear tracking performance which is what I came to Strava for.My biggest complaint with this app is that it seems like it was purpose built for run, bike, swim, but the functionality and usage has evolved beyond that for any sport- unfortunately the UI hasn‚Äôt kept up with the evolution. For example- why does my main page only give the option to display my run, bike, swim stats if I only use it for climb, ski, and hike?  It would make more sense to default to your most used 3. I don‚Äôt know anybody on the app whose main 3 are bike run swim, so there seems to be a disconnect.
 Also finding local routes seems pretty buggy, I‚Äôll get different routes every time I search somewhere, half of them missing, never any really long routes even though I know they‚Äôre there.
Wish it had better ui for climbing tracking, but it‚Äôs nice that so many other apps will plug into it.
Other than that, enjoyable community, challenges are cool, and overall more motivational to use than I anticipated.I love using Strava while running and biking but I have found, like many other users, that the heart rate tracking feature is not all its cut out to be. The functionality and user experience isn‚Äôt right. If I open the phone app to start recording a workout the watch app should also turn on and mirror what is on my phone and vise versa. Currently if you have to start a workout separately on both devices to get them to both give you information while you are on a ride or run. The heart rate will only track on the watch. But then I will have two duplicate workouts. This seems like is should be table stakes by now as other apps like Nike running already do this correctly. It‚Äôs become very frustrating that I cannot see my workout on my watch and phone real time without having to record it twice. Please work on fixing this.5/4/18 Update: What‚Äôs with the app asking which sport every time I start a ride? This appears to be a new feature and I hate it. It adds a whole unnecessary step to it all. I have bicycling as my default, so just take that and start recording! I don‚Äôt need extra steps between my starting the app and tracking my ride!!

Original Post:  So this is a great app and I use it for every ride I take. One feature that would be nice would be the ability to edit a segment of a ride, like delete part perhaps. I rode to a party and forgot to turn off the app when I got there so it tracked me walking around for 10 minutes before I realized. It'd be nice to delete out all of that walking around and have it reflect my true riding time and mileage. Otherwise, fantastic!!Been using Strava for about 5 months. Previous running app was Endomondo sports tracker which recently retired by UA. I‚Äôm now training for my 6th marathon, and this is the first time training with another app. My favorite thing about Strava is how quickly the auto- pause feature responds. Now for the bad. I‚Äôve always cross checked the distance I run with google maps, knowing that no GPS is totally accurate. Strava‚Äôs distance tracking is a lot less accurate than my previous app. It‚Äôs always shorter than actual distance. And that can be very deceiving, especially for a newer runner that‚Äôs training. So I‚Äôd advise anyone not to put too much stock in the tracking data. That 10 mile run is more like a 9 miler etc.I‚Äôve used the Strava app for cycling a lot over the past couple years and have overall enjoyed it a lot. It‚Äôs easy to use and fun to check out all the stats and tracking and whatnot. The one thing I‚Äôve found very annoying from day one is that the app always has an in-app notification that ‚Äúyour ride has finished uploading‚Äù. I just feel like I don‚Äôt need that and sometimes it can drown out other, more important notifications like when people have commented or given me kudos on a ride. Maybe others like it but I‚Äôd at least like the option to turn those notifications off. They are completely unnecessary and useless to me.I have been using Strava for a long time - 4 years or so. As of the last update, they added a feature that when you start an activity a window pops up that makes you select an activity, then you have to hit Start again to start the activity. This is SO ANNOYING. Why do I have to click 3 buttons to do one thing? Please revert back to the old way of starting an activity.
Besides this new, highly annoying, nonsensical feature Strava is the greatest distance and elevation tracking app available. If you bike, run, or hike I highly recommend it (assuming they FIX THE START FEATURE).Strava is a big part of my day, my week , my life . I subscribe because l love looking at all the data ‚Ä¶ at least when things are going well and I‚Äôm on an upswing . When I‚Äôm declining , I don‚Äôt want to look . Integration with other apps is great . I don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù feature though which seems to try and tell you where your fitness level is relative to your past performance . It‚Äôs just not clear how/what makes you get better scores others than just recording more activities .Great sharing and tracking features. Love the auto pause on the Apple Watch and phone on bike rides.

Issue that is very frustrating is that there is no option to distinguish between different types of biking. I regularly go on road bike rides and mountain bike rides and obviously my speed and effort vary greatly between the two; however there is no way to distinguish between the two in order to track progress.

Additionally, the calorie count populated as zero for exercise on the Apple Watch which is frustrating.I use this app whenever I run, workout, etc. but during my runs it only tracks the 0.1 which is kind of a pain when you are finishing up and you gotta keep looking down to see if you‚Äôve hot that 3 mile mark or something. If they could update that small little feature this app blows everyone else out of the water with HR tracking, elevation and all of the other small details it has. Very interesting for a fitness nerd like myself.
Thank you.I still think this is the best app for tracking cycling, but I don‚Äôt like the change to the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù screen on the Apple Watch app. You used to be able to set your preferred type of workout, and then the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù screen was a big easy-to-push button. The updated version of the Apple Watch app took that away, and I wish they would bring the big ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button back for people (like me) who mainly use the app to track one type of activity.I‚Äôm happy with the app, although I wish it was more accurate tracking my activity and had a better customer service who is focused on solving problems when they occur. 
Difficult to distinguish between paid and non paid services. 
I keep complaining about activities not being  accurate, especially when I run inside the city, unfortunately it seams nothing has improved.Overall the app is great for tracking my outdoor runs BUT why is the outdoor walk so limited? With the run I get pacing/splits, heart rate, etc but if you walk you get nothing. Makes no sense. The app should be able to track similar data points regardless if I am walking or running. I will at times walk 5 to 10 miles and it would great to see pace, splits, heart rate and compare to other walks. Seems like a simple fix.I do really like Strava for the clean layout and ability to track a lot of activities, but I‚Äôve had several instances of starting tracking on Strava, doing a workout, coming back to my phone, and the app has just not recorded my workout (or only part of it).

However! I think integrating a private messaging or something along those lines would be a good addition. I can see it kind of making it a ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù app, but the only way to meet new people is through commenting. When you need to exchange phone numbers or emails it has to be done via the comment section of an activity. When doing that, it leaves it open to the public to do with they please with it; when it was intended for someone else. Other than that no issues at all. Great app.Strava is a really good app for tracking your movements while you‚Äôre jogging or biking. I like the way it summarizes your overall activity for every week. Represents useful information like the distance you covered, the time it took to cover the distance, and the route for where you‚Äôve been going.

My only problem with this app is that doesn‚Äôt show your calorie percentage or quantity. Even something that‚Äôs approximate would work. I think this would matter to anyone who is concerned with the amount of calories they consume and burn.I like other apps personally but I so enjoy sharing and keeping in touch with running and cycling friends as well as seeing how my segments rate with others.  It is motivating and keeps me accountable for my effort and progress.  The BIG problem is that Strava has been crashing on my I watch lately.  I have had multiple problems using Strava with my watch.  This is why I bought the I watch!  Other apps work much more consistently but I really wish I didn‚Äôt have to switch tracking programs in the middle of my training plan.Strava gets so many things right with this app. From the accuracy of it tracking to the syncing with it desktop client I have not found anything that compares.

I would like to give it 4 1/2 star but that is not an option. The only improvement I would like is I would like single season achievements. I was in a motorcycle accident a few years ago and had to stop cycling for a time and I am not as fast as I was then but I would like to see my improvements over the course of a season. Outside of that this is an outstanding app.I regularly use Strava and love a lot of the benefits - integration with Garmin, tracking mileage for my shoes, sharing popular routes and segments so I can find running trails in other cities, etc. What could make it 5 stars is if they had a more comprehensive list of activities when entering a workout. For example: my tennis match, barre class, and yoga practice all have to be categorized as a ""workout"", when it wouldn't be hard to make the list more comprehensive. But overall recommended.I like using this app for tracking my workouts and routes for biking and running. I love the challenges. It‚Äôs a great motivator. I would like to recommend to the developers to put a search function on Strava to search my previous activities and that of my friends. It would be nice to even be able to search by month and year instead of having to continuously scroll to find a past activity. Overall this is a good app to use.Great for tracking my exercise and connecting with my exercise buddies. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs good enough that I continue to use it in spite of its flaws.

For example, a recent update added new notifications about my goals that I don‚Äôt want and cannot turn off. Most other notifications can be turned off, but not these. I think this is the latest in a pattern of ill-considered changes to the app that the developer later fixes or removes.I love this tracking app.
I do have issues with the time being switched.   If I am tracking yoga or biking, importing from my iwatch it is adjusted 4 hours later.   I do not have this issue when tracking biking, but I track that on the app and usually my iwatch as well.  Not a huge a issue, but it is annoying.   There also isn‚Äôt a way to report an issue that I have found if you are not a subscriber.I use this for cycling and dog walking a lot, and I love it for that, but I do have a suggestion. I would also like to use this for tracking time spent on self defense through manual entries. Could you create a category for that please? Maybe it could be measured through time spent. I could include the description like one would do for anything else. 

Thank you,
John L.I‚Äôve been using Strava for years and only had some minor blips along the way with tracking. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the latest updates, but the app cannot seem to pick up my usual routes anymore. My latest run has me cutting through yards and skipping long tracts, resulting in me running 5:00 miles. I wish!I love tracking my activities with strava, I use it multiple times a week. I have two wishes to improve my use of this app. I wish I could search/sort my activities to find a specific run and I wish the statistics portion of my profile show my fastest 1k, 5k, 10k, etc with the option to click on that activity. Thanks for such a great app!Strava has been my fitness tracking app for several years now, and over that time it‚Äôs getting better and better.
I use Apple products for recording and viewing my activities, and Strava‚Äôs integration of the Apple Watch has improved and that‚Äôs great!",0,Adrians MustacheÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±ŸäMrsCoachTRhoward14KayRo29Shantastic427PhiloratioPlayinmomTigbenchBtbxgirlDkdrdjsnbehxjjabdbJohnDaDo,"Almost there!A good app that is missing somethingFix the bugs please!The Best Cycling AppGood fitness tracking app, but key pieces missingGood app but areas for improvementGreat!Good but some glitchesI love this, but one suggestion.Issues with satellite tracking?Great tool,Strava Evolving",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,0,1,0,0,1,1,12,1,0,0,966,has_tracking,163

The new version does. The free version was essentially stripped of all features besides base tracking. All of these features were moved into the paid tier. All of this, especially in a time where tons of people are out of work feel incredibly greedy. 

I‚Äôll still use this app as someone who has paid, but it‚Äôs going to be harder to recommend it to others. Also this decision on Strava‚Äôs part has left a bad taste in my mouth towards a company that I otherwise liked.I‚Äôve experienced the crashing problem only a few times in the recent update, but the most annoying problem is inaccurate tracking. I‚Äôll click start, it reads ‚Äúgps signal acquired‚Äù, and I‚Äôll start the run and when I check it after a few minutes it will be tracking the time but show no distance. When I stop the activity and go to the map, it always displays my location accurately, but it didn‚Äôt track what I‚Äôd done. The blue GPS icon on the top left of the screen still displays on the lock screen while I‚Äôm running, but it won‚Äôt record miles. It will be off an on for the duration of the runAfter a year or so of hit-and-miss with the watch version's reliability, I had a solid year of excellent performance. Unfortunately, the latest updates have rendered the watch app unstable. I have uninstalled and reinstalled on multiple occasions - both on my phone and on my watch. More often than not, when I start a run on my watch, I get the Strava logo with a parade of dots running around in a circle until the app crashes. Sometimes it eventually loads but increasingly I just get frustrated and give up after 5 minutes.

I purchased my watch and Strava pro specifically for tracking and monitoring my runs. Unfortunately, Strava can't keep it's apps running in a stable fashion.The app and analytics it offers is amazing.  I love it!  However,  it does not offer work tracking for swims. For an app that seems to market to triathletes, you would think it would have swimming functionality as well.  My Apple Watch does a great job of tracking swims. However, I can‚Äôt get all of the data synced with Strava, such as, metrics like heart rate and lap splits.  Also, if I manually input the swim,  it doesn‚Äôt factor into many of the analytics, such as the fitness and relative effort charts.  That being said,  this would be a 5 Star app if it was not for the limited swimming functionality.For years I have been using this app and it has worked great. But within the last month or so, it refuses to record distance and pace correctly. It basically stops tracking distance and pace. It is basically, at this point, a stopwatch recording my time.  I sent a note to their customer service a week ago and have yet to receive a response. At this point, there are plenty of other apps to use.Seems to pick and choose days it will work/not work. I know strava isn't the MOST accurate when it comes to tracking  your time and miles. But when I pay for the premium I expect it to actually track my results. Instead I come back home only to realize that after 2 hours of riding it didn't record a single mile. You're honestly just better off getting a bike computer.Not sure if it is a Strava ap or Apple problem, but ever since I did the latest update on my phone my ap is closing and not tracking me during my entire run.  3 days ago I ran close to 5.5 miles but my ap only said 3.8 miles and then the route it showed I ran was a straight line, which is impossible unless I ran thru extra thick brush!   If it weren‚Äôt for this I would rate 5 stars.

Anyone else having these issues?I have used this app for years love it but for the last 2 to 3 weeks it‚Äôs been displaying my morning rides to afternoon ridesmy afternoon rides to morning rides and it is not tracking the correct mileage. I have quite a few friends that use it and we are all experiencing the same thing! Strava people fix it!I am unable to use the app for tracking distance. Whenever I click start it give a pop up that says enable background app refresh. I do exactly what it says to do and go to settings, but the button is on and grayed out. What should I do?I LOVED this app! It WAS accurate. Now it tracks my runs and rides as the crow flies instead of my actual routes, and the timer quits tracking at 10 seconds giving me really inaccurate times. What‚Äôs up, Strava? This just happened in the last 2 weeks!The reason to have a paid account is for planning routes. Can‚Äôt do that on free. I love tracking my miles and most of my friends use Strava so I stick with it. If a more socially connected app existed I would ditch it.Strava worked nicely for tracking my bike club rides until recently with auto stop start failed to restart after a brief lunch stop. So remainder of ride not recorded - never had this occur before!

The amount of sports that it has and the data generated is bar none the best. I also use trail forks as this doesn‚Äôt really have a map option of known trails like Trailforks or all trails but the free version gives you insights those other aforementioned apps do not and the paid version(subscription based) has a few more features(always coming out with more) that I found quite interesting and slightly more insightful. Also for those solo shredders, walker, hikers, and anyone using the app, the community based competition is also very inviting and allows you to ouch yourself against other people and against the clock. This allows you to use this also as a training aid and or just to see how your personal fitness stacks up from year to year, week to week, day to day. I love this app and find myself using it everyday. Stay stoked and I highly recommend it!!ü§òü§ôThis app has 100% enhanced my workout experience. First of all, I don‚Äôt record the run using the app... I ABSOLUTELY recommend using your Apple Watch (or whatever gps tracking watch) when completing a workout and downloading an app called, ‚ÄúHealthFit.‚Äù That app will automatically upload your workout to Strava. It‚Äôs incredibly reliable. Trust me, I ran over 1,400 miles last year and every single workout was incredibly accurate and correct. Next, the amount of depth and detail gone into every workout analysis is, like I said, simply amazing. The app is incredible and reliable and I have been more dedicated to running than ever, ever since I started using this app and getting to analyze my runs and, literally, see my progression over time. It‚Äôs incredible in every way and I am a paid subscriber and am going to use this for years to come.This is the Depository of all workout apps. If you use Garmin or Apple- it‚Äôs a must have.
You will see your friends workouts and be able to compare your workout to theirs...Seamlessly! 

Segments are so easy. Compare your times to other who have done the same route or a small portion of a route: Run or Bike. For example: I might have just bike 50 Miles. There might be 10 segments and I can choose any or all when I am done. Strava let‚Äôs me see how I did against: other males; females; how I ranked today- for the year- all time- and if you‚Äôre Premium then by weight and more!

Set up your own segment and watch how you rank. This is fun and motivating for me. Also- I love how it keeps track of my mileage YTD and I can see how many miles I road at a quick glance.

I love my Garmin Connect, but this lets me see my buddies and I can find and or follow all my friends and track how hard they work out by their HR score (Suffer Score?).

This is a must have app. Set your privacy setting to what your comfort level is if you just want to share with certain people.  

Learn, analyze and enjoy each workout with the App that gives back!Strava has replaced all my other social services and apps completely, and so much more. So many great things in this app, for instance, PR tracking and notifications, Strava flybys, integration with endless other services and hardware, auto upload workouts from other devices, so many things it‚Äôs too long and vast to list all the features but those are some of my favorites but barely scratch the surface.

If you are interested in working out, and interested in sharing the activity with your friends and tracking it like a video game: this is for you, very good for workout motivation also.I have used and enjoyed other activity tracking apps. I, like many others, was introduced to Strava by a friend. I enjoy the social aspects, being encouraged by friends and in turn encouraging them. I enjoy having challenges to work toward. I love seeing how my runs compare to previous runs. I am glad that the developers keep trying to make the app better.

I tried premium but my training style is more casual so there was not as much value in it for me. A tiered subscription might be enticing for users who are not trying to be professional athletes. Plus my friends can already track me with other apps.Strava is the king of all ride/run tracking apps, and is probably in the top-3 I use overall, in terms of frequency. It‚Äôs the best ride and run  tracker, that‚Äôs a given. But it‚Äôs also great for almost any other activity, and the social features - particularly public segments, leaderboards, photo sharing, discussions, route creation, club organization etc. etc. are extremely sticky and it‚Äôs hard to imagine any challenger ever dethroning it. I don‚Äôt have any financial stake in the company, I just genuinely love the app. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs far and away the best in its field. 5+ stars.I have had Strava for about a year and a half now and let me say, it's amazing. The amount of features that you get without paying the subscription is outstanding. The app got even better for me when in January, I purchased an Apple Watch Series 4. It works seemlessly on my watch, tracking all my segments and such correctly. The app has motivated me with its challenges and social aspect to get out more and run/ride/hike etc. I have lost nearly 30lbs since the beginning of the year and Strava has certainly helped. Hope to see the app get even better with time.Updating my review to 5 stars after Strava reversed its decision not to sync to Apple health data from 3rd party apps. Strava is the perfect central hub to integrate my cycling apps (TrainerRoad and Garmin Connect) into one database to track performance, as well as communicate health stats seamlessly in the Apple ecosystem. As I have become a more avid cyclist, I have definitely found value in Strava‚Äôs services for tracking performance and trends and, as a result, am an annual subscriber.

Thank you for listening to your customers!I enjoy using the app for tracking workouts and seeing what my friends across the world are up to.

I previously left a review stating that the synchronization of workouts from Apple Health (created using the Apple Watch workout app) to Strava wasn‚Äôt working, but I found out it was due to some privacy settings set in Apple Health!

It now works and I was delighted to see even walks recorded with the workout app are available for import, since I tend to spontaneously start running with my puppy.Love the interface and list of activities.  I think connecting it to a watch adds to the apps depth as it opens up more stats to view and allows you to complete more activities (i.e indoor workouts or yoga) that won‚Äôt record properly with Strava‚Äôs standard GPS tracking system.  The addition of being able to upload videos as well as the 3D satellite maps is entering as well as (for paid memberships) getting to view your life map.Love Strava - it‚Äôs a core part of my cycling, from route planning to performance tracking to catching up with friends.

Really wish there was a tablet version, though. When I‚Äôm working on creating or reviewing routes, I really dislike doing it on even the large screen of my iphone 11max. Typing this on my ipad, but for Strava I have to go do my desktop instead. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs easier said than done, but a lot of us subscribers would appreciate it‚Ä¶This app is great for folks that want to keep track of their activities.  I really like the data that it keeps for heart rate and stuff. If I had to give one piece of advice is the fitness score doesn't seem to be accurate.  I am not sure how it is measured but you don't really get a lot of credit for short workouts no matter how hard they are.  I recommend this app to everyone I ride, run when I did or without with.Strava is a great app! I enjoy tracking my bike rides and walks. I also enjoy skateboarding but unfortunately they don‚Äôt have that as an option. So I absolutely think that it would be wonderful if they added skateboarding as an option to track yourself. For all my skaters out there who have Strava, I think that they would be happy to know that they have that option! Otherwise overall Strava is a very enjoyable app.I really enjoy being able to see my and others data, explore new routes, analyze fitness tracking, and have one place where my fitness life story is found. Strava links with so many devices and websites and does a great job with a mostly add free feel.  I do wish they had a dark mode as I hate looking at the bright screen planning tomorrows adventure right before I go to bed.Fun app for MTBing to track your fitness, and push limits. Just because you‚Äôre trying to set records tho, stay on the trail and don‚Äôt make shortcuts. There‚Äôs a achievement in making that obstacle, or getting that segment ‚Äúintact‚Äù w/o making new lines. 

Making the ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù live tracking feature accessible to all is an unbelievable feature that will no doubt save people headaches, if not lives!Strava itself is great.  I‚Äôve used it for years.  I have noticed recently (as have several of my friends) that the GPS tracking is taking a very long to acquire, and will sometimes drop during a ride.  The ‚Äúlost‚Äù mileage is usually 1-2 miles on rides of known distance.  This has been the normal mode of operation for the last several months, and hasn‚Äôt been an issue prior to that.Strava has revolutionized my fitness journey with its rich features and social aspect. Connecting with friends, joining challenges, and tracking progress in activities like running and cycling keeps me motivated. The app's detailed analytics and compatibility with various devices make it an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their fitness experience. Highly recommended!I have found this to be a great tool of tracking how I‚Äôm progressing with my daily activities and even training for any races.  Having various challenges have been my motivation to keep improving.  Great way to also connect with other people in various clubs or activities.  Happy to see athletes helping athletes attain their goals!Strava is great for tracking your activities and efforts for cycling, running and swimming. 
You also can use it for workouts and other activities not listed, however, Strava needs to update how activities such as gym workouts are shown and have a list of other sports that can be tracked or the ability to add other sports such as dirt biking. 
Strava is well overdue for updating the appEverything about this app is easy to use and it‚Äôs features are one of a kind. Incredibly reliable and is able to synch with other devices. Has helped me beyond words better myself as an athlete and individual. I use this app almost everyday and cannot see myself ever using another fitness tracking app.I‚Äôm not into instagram or other social sites but I love using Strava to see what my friends all over the world are doing for fun and training as well as sharing my own exercise adventures. The recent updates have also made tracking performance metrics a lot easier, although other apps like TrainingPeaks are better for that kind of thing.I love the app. It tracks a lot of stuff and makes tracking not only your running but help stay connected with friends as well. 

My only complaints would be resulted to the Apple Watch interface.

1.  Unable to hear starts, mile markers, and finishes when using the Apple Watch. Especially when music is playing. 

2.  On the Apple Watch while you are running it does not show your distance to the hundredth place only to the tenth place. 

3.  When posting to social media, it again only shows the distance to the tenth and not the hundredth. It rounds down the distance when posting.  Trivial, but still.  Show the whole distance!Strava is easy to use, it makes it fun to look back on what I have accomplished. It helps me to see how my current fitness compares to previous years. I paid for the upgrade and didn‚Äôt use it much, but consider it a worthy donation. I put my phone on airplane mode when I‚Äôm riding, to preserve battery. The GPS does a great job of tracking my ride.I resisted using Strava for a long time and finally gave it a go. Some of the metrics are questionable nor am I using the social aspect of it. Tracking and segments shine for me. The segments have changed the way I ride for the better and give me motivation to push harder. I mainly go at it solo so having goals mid ride are a huge plus. I upgraded to premium after 2 weeks. I‚Äôm happy!Just got motivated to do a review because you guys finally put out a release note on a minor release. Uninformative notes on minor releases is a pet peeve of mine, and I‚Äôm hoping this is a trend. 

All and all a great app and site, still the center of my running tracking. 

Need to support power meters for running (like Stryd) to stay up with the times though.Strava has helped me connect with other runners around my area and the world. It did a fantastic job at tracking my workouts and overall activity. I can see my pacing, elevation, and other averages along with a history of my best efforts! I will be using Strava for a long time!1. Best-in-class
2. Privacy standards are above industry standard
3. Social component/challenges do not overwhelm the app‚Äôs core focus‚Äî tracking fitness/recreational activities
4. UX/UI is very easy to navigate
5. What‚Äôs next? Need to try Strava Premium to see how much more there is to offer.When we started bikedetroit back in 2001, there really wasn‚Äôt a good app out there for tracking or bike rides that my good friend Derek recommended his friend a lady who started this app called Strava. That‚Äôs the only app that I have I‚Äôve shared it over 1000 times.  Thank  you #bikedetroitI use Strava as a form of motivation, holding myself responsible for my training as well as others. I also like it for tracking my workouts and comparing my training. It‚Äôs nice to be able to follow top athletes in the sport to see how they train as well.The best sport tracking app there is! Yes there is the best sport tracking app there is, but come on!! GarminConnect already has a multisport view!!! Who is interested in ‚Äúmorning activity‚Äù (my transition from swim to bike) on its own!!!!
Besides it wont benefit just triathletes, there is duathlon biathlon, swim-run races and brick workouts!!!!This has worked well for the past two years tracking my mileage and mapping my commutes.
Had a recent hiccup with GPS reception over the last week; Strava support was very helpful getting to the root cause. Turned out to be an iOS update I‚Äôd missed.
Back on the trail!Love the many different activities available and the way the app compares to other activities. I love tracking the pace and the progress and profile. Super easy to use! So glad I joined this and became a member! Definitely recommend.This is a great app. I am a young cyclist fresh out of college and I was not able to afford a good ride computer. The GPS ride tracking made that much less of a problem. If you want a sense of community and friendly competition, this app is for you.Once I learned I could still track GPS location in low power and/or airplane mode, my battery survives several-hour rides. Makes tracking and showing off easy!Love tracking my rides, sharing pics, giving and getting kudos. Strava gets me out there and has helped me met a huge circle of cyclist in the Chicago area, but also, across the world. My most used app. Strava is my only social media.Great App. It's fun and motivating to see your friends out exercising! Distances can be a little off, think this has to do with GPS tracking interval setting.

It took over 2 months to get a response on a support ticket I placed - and that was after having to replace the ticket because they closed the first one without even working it. 

I get plenty of use out of the app but I‚Äôve paid significantly less for apps that work better. The app is glitchy when actually trying to record workouts. I hardly actually use the app anymore due to this and have had to purchase accessories from Garmin and Wahoo to get accurate workout recordings that just upload to Strava. I guess its nice to have all my workouts & photos in one place.

They shifted around the UX recently for training goals and it‚Äôs just never been the same after that. I like the data visualizations but it‚Äôs really after quantity which isn‚Äôt always the best indicator. It‚Äôs still a pretty immature training plan and there are better ones out there. This is really just becoming social media for athletes.I‚Äôve been using Strava for years.  This year it has really helped my wife and I become more physically active, we‚Äôve been setting goals and Strava made it fun to meet them.  My wife loved that it showed how many miles she's gone over the month.

They recently removed this feature in the free version, putting it behind the pay wall.  Pretty sad.  So now you're not paying for new features, you're paying for features you used to have.  Not going to happen, $60 is too much.  We might pay a one time $5 charge or something, but we aren't going to add another subscription.  

Thanks for the help over the years, Strava, but I guess it's time we move on.  Sorry you've become sellouts.This app does what it‚Äôs intended for but falls very short in long term goals. This tracks your ride but you will begin to see bugs where activities aren‚Äôt ever recorded in your history, despite you starting the recording. 

This is immensely frustrating since this app bugs out and never records my really long activities. 

I‚Äôm riding around for 2 hours thinking it will record, nope it doesn‚Äôt.

Edit: lowered my review to three stars. Blatant cash grab from this most recent update. I‚Äôve loved this app for a long time but this is bad. All this right in the middle of a pandemic where money is short. It‚Äôs disappointing and I expected more. I understand that you devs need to eat, and I encourage you to try to make more money off of this great app BY IMPROVING PREMIUM FEATURES. I would actually buy premium (I promise) if you gave me even more analytics or an improved route maker or more goals options. Now I will NOT EVER buy premium to get back my favorite features because I‚Äôm principally opposed to being extorted. Give your loyal fans back the service we‚Äôve come to expect, and improve your paid service with new ideas.Do not pay for this app, use TrainingPeaks if your serious about training. This was a great app, then they stopped development and so I stopped paying. It‚Äôs great for free, TrainingPeaks is a much better paid solution if your serious about data analytics and goals, great team over there. Strava lacks basic separation between mountain bikes or road. It can‚Äôt help you explore and create a route when you find yourself somewhere new. They refuse to respond to community boards on their own website. It‚Äôs pretty cool as an odometer and to check out what friends are doing. But it‚Äôs very frustrating to see these guys ignoring the people that built them.You guys at strava really screwed the people who liked using this app for free . Now we can‚Äôt see out weekly goals without paying and I can‚Äôt see my progression over segments without paying . I‚Äôm not talking about comparing efforts I‚Äôm just talking about seeing the ‚Äúperformance over time ‚Äú and the leaderboard are no longer available. It use to make you pay for leaderboards amongst your age group. Just a huge thumbs down from me for those two reasons . Seriously strava crew what‚Äôs the deal ? If I wanna track my ride and stats I‚Äôd use the under armor app or wahoo . 
Sincerely, 
A disappointed user .Please bring back goals to profile page, they are projected training, not logged training with metrics. It's the first thing I want to see when I go to my profile, and now they're buried.

Also please extend the window of training peak log on profile for a better view of distance over time. 

While hashtag map view are cool with support to BLM and Pride, think about using colors on the map to denote workout intensities/HR/cadence/watts so we can track improvement when we traverse the same course.

Flybys would be a nice feature for the app as well, or a notice on the map when we passed near a friend/teammate.",0,hatchers11epiekarcreviewsthatnakeyouthinkkevjoagar,"Awesome but it got messed upNeeds New LeadershipGreat app but still not payingUpdates not improving app, suggestions",StravaStravaStravaStrava,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,486,has_goals,34

Has accurate GPS and good integration with other apps. The challenges allow you to push yourself and set goals to achieve and compete with friends.

I transferred to Strava from Adidas Run app due to its integrations however there are a few things I miss that I wish Strava had.

1. Importing your GPSX data is a tedious and manual process that restricts you to 100 uploads a day, it took me 5 days to import all my runs from previous years

2. Using the Apple Watch app, the audio cues for runs do not emit to your headphones, you have to make sure your headphones are connected to both your phone and your watch if you are listening to music with your phone

3. Even though Apple Watch can track cadence the strava app does not, so it‚Äôs a missing dataset. There are hacks I‚Äôve found to work around this, but not without using a third party app.

4. One of the biggest things is custom trainings. You could set your own training sessions up so that you can do 30 second sprints and 1 min rest on repeat with audio cues. Instead I have to keep track of my miles or time to know when to do the next stage of my workout.

I would love if these were integrated and would make the app an incredible experience for training.I started running a few weeks ago and absolutely love this app to track my miles. I was excited to join the challenges to see how far I can push myself and meet new goals. However, given a condition I have in my hips and back I can only do low impact running indoors. I have to add each activity manually which I‚Äôve learned do not count towards challenges. I don‚Äôt know if it a glitch in the app or a choice Stravia is making but it was disappointing I couldn‚Äôt join the challenges. Otherwise this app is fantastic.I have been an avid Strava user/subscriber for years for my biking. I live in the NE and during the winter months I indoor row on my WaterRower and log my rows manually in Strava. What I don‚Äôt get is why the Strava team cannot link this manual data to a annual miles/km goal under the water section so I can track my rowing and be invented to do better each time just like I do biking. Yes, I‚Äôve reported this many times.

Anybody else frustrated by the lack of manual activity reporting to goals?",0,oonix8Bubbles exploxtionGary.B,"Great Mertric TrackingGreat app with a minor flawGreat App, but...",StravaStravaStrava,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,444,has_goals,34

I do however wish there were more options for (a) goal setting and (b) workouts: 
(A) I do wish I could set more than just a weekly and yearly mileage goals, being able to reach a pace goal or a run distance goal would be great for motivation. 
(B) one of the features I miss about my Garmin was being able to set a goal distance or time or split pace for the run i.e. 6.5 mi or 60min or 9min/mi instead of having to constantly look at my watch to see when I have reached that point. I also wish there was a feature to set up workouts for the week I.e tempo run on Tue at various paces. This feature especially has me turning back to my Garmin when I train for big races.Great for tracking my exercise and connecting with my exercise buddies. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs good enough that I continue to use it in spite of its flaws.

For example, a recent update added new notifications about my goals that I don‚Äôt want and cannot turn off. Most other notifications can be turned off, but not these. I think this is the latest in a pattern of ill-considered changes to the app that the developer later fixes or removes.I recommend upgrading from sneakers to cleats to novices. I recommend top quality components to veteran riders. I recommend STRAVA to everybody. I joined as a geek looking for an easy way to track miles and map routes.

Whether you're a runner, cyclist, or just someone looking to track their fitness journey, Strava's intuitive interface and community-driven features make it the go-to platform. The route discovery, competitive segments, and detailed analytics offer insights into your performance like no other app. But beyond the metrics, it's the global community of athletes that truly sets Strava apart, making every workout feel like part of a larger, supportive network. A must-have for anyone passionate about their fitness goals!While so many apps I've tried boast about the bells and whistles they've been able to incorporate, Strava has taken a more less is more approach. They track runs accurately, analyze data and provide helpful feedback. While my NikePlus friends list was longer, my real life engagement with the few Strava followers is far more meaningful and beneficial to my running goals. I'd categorize Strava as an app for real runners. Skip the frills and just run. 
I'm a fan of this app and look forward to years of running with it.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to mash up social media with a running/cycling app? Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to map your runs/rides, track your distance, monitor your goal progress, post running/cycling photos while also cheering on your friends who are working on their goals? 

Good news! The mash-up has already been developed with Strava. It is the cyclist and runner‚Äôs app joined with social media. I love it! It inspires me to see my fellow runners‚Äô progress. I can like their posts and add comments. The Strava app has boosted my progress as a runner this year.I love Strava. I have the paid subscription but even the free features allow one to record all exercise. I add pictures of all the gorgeous places I ride, and use the app more like FaceBook or Instagram, mostly for myself or for anyone who‚Äôs half-interested in what I‚Äôm up to. Anything that assists in reaching your exercise goals is a good thing and Strava allows you to do this seamlessly.This app is amazing. You can record almost anything, from a soccer game to kayaking! There is no dislikes, you can make your account so only your followers will see your activities and you can make it so people have to request to follow you! There is goals you can reach and you can achieve digital trophies! This app is awesome and I recommend it 100%I have found this to be a great tool of tracking how I‚Äôm progressing with my daily activities and even training for any races.  Having various challenges have been my motivation to keep improving.  Great way to also connect with other people in various clubs or activities.  Happy to see athletes helping athletes attain their goals!I love keeping track of my activities and seeing how my friends are progressing on their goals. I do not care for the politically motivated commentary. Given the current climate of high tensions I value a place where the focus is on personal goals and physical activities and encouraging others to push themselves in various physical activities.What an absolutely wonderful app, where it not only helps newbie‚Äôs such as myself meet others in my community thanks to Strava, but also to uplift, encourage, and root one another on in our own personal journeys. The beauty is we each have our own goals, and our own reasons, but one thing remains in common, the love, support, encouragement, and inspiration of others on here! Thank you Strava!It doesn‚Äôt get any better than Strava! A well know brand that is easy to navigate and fun. Connect with friends or just set your own personal goals for motivation. Whether you are new to sport monitoring or a seasoned vet Strava is the one to connect with. Start your membership now and bring in the new year on track!I LOVE Strava!  I don‚Äôt care if anyone else does or does not look at my rides.  Strava has made me a much, MUCH better rider than I would have been.  I challenge myself everyday and Strava has made that very easy.  I track all my stats and set personal goals all the time.  Having that data so easily accessible has really helped my development as a cyclist.I resisted using Strava for a long time and finally gave it a go. Some of the metrics are questionable nor am I using the social aspect of it. Tracking and segments shine for me. The segments have changed the way I ride for the better and give me motivation to push harder. I mainly go at it solo so having goals mid ride are a huge plus. I upgraded to premium after 2 weeks. I‚Äôm happy!This app, and the ability to set long term goals, is the reason I stuck to running for the last three years. From not being able to run a single mile straight in 2016 to just completing my first marathon, Strava has helped me track and document the whole process!Usually people perceive addiction to social media as negative. My addiction to Strava has made me run more and get closer to reaching my goals. I recommend this app to anyone who has or wants to make some friends in the fitness world and also want to improve their physical ability.I love this app as it keep me honest and accountable regarding my fitness. Recently, I‚Äôve used this app less for cycling and more for other endeavors. However, I specifically love this app when applied to cycling goals and results. While some use this for PB‚Äôs on descents, I love comparing my results on climbs I do regularly.This app helps keep you on track and motivated for your running goals.

For me what set Strava apart from the hundreds of other fitness trackers was the segment leaderboard and segment history features. With these core features now behind a very expensive paywall, I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôll possibly attract new users (no one is going to just jump in and start paying the huge premium without understanding these features first hand).  And, as current users who are unwilling or unable to pay the large premium slowly move away from the app, the leaderboard concept loses much of it‚Äôs value.  What fun is competing over and over against the same 3 people in town who choose to be subscribers!? Seems like a death spiral in the making. Really weird and unfortunate ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù! I had been seriously considering signing up for the premium service, but this update struck me as really obnoxious, and also makes me question whether the leaderboards will even be worth paying for in a few months once everyone leaves.‚ÄúNARP‚Äù: non-athletic regular person.

After using the app as a paid subscriber for well over a year now, I have learned that Strava is not even close to what it is hyped up to be. The amount of technology errors is absolutely unacceptable and the quality of updates only proceeds to go downhill. It is beyond apparent that Strava is a company with below average programmers, none of whom actually use the app themselves. Ie. I have not met a single person that has runs upload regularly without a hitch- and I just recorded a ride directly to my phone that didn‚Äôt upload. How does that even happen when it has internet connection the entire route?

Moral of the story: dozens of easy to fix errors that persist while paywalls go up and no new features roll out. You have to wonder what the programmers are doing with the exorbitant price I pay for this app.For all the bells and whistles that are added, Strava fails miserably to do the ONE most important thing: accurately track your runs! It was once quite reliable, but recently the accuracy has dropped precipitously. On 80% of my runs in a large, suburban community, the GPS jumps around and completely ruins my distance and pace stats. I have no idea how far I ran or how fast, and it seriously screws up my all-time stats too. I keep the app up-to-date and have sent MULTIPLE requests to customer service for help, with NO REPLY. I‚Äôve been using Strava for years, and I‚Äôll be sad to abandon my running history, but this is totally unacceptable and I‚Äôm switching to a better platform! You should, too.A couple years ago I bought an Apple Watch and had a problem uploading runs when I would get back in range of my phone after returning from a run. Here we are with dozens of updates later and the problem STILL exists. I have done the workarounds Strava suggests, making sure I am out of range of the one before starting the run. Still have the problem. I can see the run in my watch history, but no matter how many times I try to force it to manually upload from the watch, nothing. This happens even while the watch/phone combo uploads other activities. VERY frustrating. 

I can not recommend this app if you regularly use an Apple Watch away from your phone.Was encouraged to try this app so i downloaded, would only install if i gave it a credit card to enable a free trial which i did because it assured me i could cancel.  Two weeks before the end of the trial i  decided i didn‚Äôt want it, tried using the cancel button in the app and it does nothing.  I canceled through Apple purchase history, says it has been cancelled although the app still says i am signed up for full year of service after trial ends.  Hope Apple comes through for me because i am not encouraged by other reviewers response they have gotten from strava support.I was just beginning to get hooked Strava and as a casual rider would even pay $2-3/mo. But $60? I‚Äôll put that toward a new dropper post.

The problem is that the app is near worthless relative to other tracking apps without the subscription. I can‚Äôt even see my prior rides to compare times without a subscription. Suggestion  to Strava if they care to keep me or many here
1) keep personal segments and tracking free. Without it, you‚Äôll lose your free base
2) create a mid-tier for basic leaderboards, such as the overall leaderboard and maybe friends. I‚Äôd pay $2 maybe $3 per month
3) create the upper tier with all the fancy leaderboards, deeper analytics, etc. charge $5-10 for those who care enough

This keeps you free base with enough features and history to stay, while monetizing more. Lose the base and your future profits will drop. Best of luckI have Strava on my iPhone and Apple watch. The watch app is glitchy (auto-pause doesn‚Äôt disengage at the start of my run) and for the past week (before the most recent update and after) refuses to automatically sync to my phone. The ‚ÄúSync‚Äù button in Run History is useless. Strava Support hasn‚Äôt been much help in fixing this. I had no trouble before the most recent updates. Generally I love Strava, but this lack of connectivity is really starting to bother me. Without GPS data, none of the features in Strava are accessibleI have the free version.  I am never going to pay for premium. With that said the newest update just made this app even less valuable then the previous ones.  Now I cant even see my weekly totals unless I upgrade to premium.  I realize it is not free to build and maintain but come on.   How petty can you be as a company to not even let me see a total of my activities.  I just hope I can still export my activity history for free.   But I am sure there will be a fee for that too.I have been a long time user. The last few updates they have kept removing features and making them paid. You can‚Äôt even see your own history or compare against friends anymore. App no longer gives me any value. Hopefully another company will do this. I may not be their target audience anymore since I‚Äôm not willing to pay $60 a year for this. I just deleted my account and hope another company will add this functionality.I have always loved Strava but since getting the be Apple Watch none of my runs are saved in the history in my watch. I have tried all the trouble shooting I have seen online and and really tired of logging out and back into my account to recover the data. Will have to quit using this app until issue is fixed.

It‚Äôs been several months now and the issue has not been fixed! Will be deleting this app!! So sad used to be a great app!Strava made recent updates During the height of COVID-19 which prevents you from
Viewing your history without upgrading the paid membership.   They also took away other features.     Paid membership is $5 a month or $60 for year.

Do you know what your FTP is? Your power zones? Your heart rate zones? Do you want to know how these evolve over time and see the impact that they make on your fitness? Yes? NOT FOR YOU. Strava has a major flaw in that any changes to your fitness measures will rewrite your entire history on the platform. So if your FTP goes up to 300 and you update it, Strava thinks you've always had 300 and will update all your old rides as if that were the case  this makes their Premium Fitness & Freshness feature completely useless. Strava even acknowledges this bug and seemingly has no interest at all in fixing it. What this tells me is that they aren't REALLY interested in being an excellent fitness app. They're interested in being a social app and accruing paying customers.Have been loving this app! As a new runner I was excited to have my entire history from my very first run all in one place. Now in week 3 of training for a 10k I‚Äôm starting to appreciate the need for pacing. While I‚Äôve already been a bit frustrated that I can‚Äôt see my current pace (only average pace), today is my first tempo run and being able to see my current pace is kind of important. I was even willing to level up to the paid version to get this feature. But alas, it does not exist. Seems like such a simple thing. I‚Äôm jumping ship to another app solely because of this, couldn‚Äôt bring myself to give more than 2 stars. Makes no sense to me why this feature isn‚Äôt on the menu.Longtime (free) Strava user here. I‚Äôm a recreational rider who rides 3-4 times a week and always liked to track my segments and performances throughout the year. All of the other premium features were not enough for me to warrant an actual paid subscription. So what do the owners of Strava decide to do in the middle of a Worldwide pandemic? Decontent the free app and try and squeeze a few more bucks out of the millions of loyal users. Segment history: GONE. Basic Leaderboard stats: GONE. Great job Strava. Hate to do it, but I‚Äôll be testing out new tracking apps as an alternative. Reason...pure spite.I have been using Strava regularly in a effort to really understand why people are so drawn to it. In a word: it‚Äôs the feed. It‚Äôs seeing what others are doing and measuring your progress against them. My issues with the app are:
1: bad UX.  It is confusing to use the app. I want to go straight to my history which is under profile.  
What‚Äôs the purpose of the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù tab?  Seems useless. I spend too much time trying to find my history and rides and the app is confusing. Make it simpler. 
2. It seems inaccurate.  I have used Strava on the same runs and compared it with my friends Garmin GPS watch.  Strava always seems about a half mile off than the others.  I‚Äôve tried different apps too, and used phone only and Apple Watch and the mileage is really inconsistent.  

I wish it was a better app, because the ability to connect with friends is great.THis is probably one of the best apps out there for analyzing the detail of your workouts. I bring over my swims from MySwimPro and use it to record my bike workouts.

Unfortunately, all of this data and the way it is presented is of little use if you can‚Äôt get the workout data to sync back to the app from your Apple Watch. That has been my problem for a few months now.

I can do an outdoor walk and it syncs fine. An outdoor ride is another story completely. I usually have to reboot my watch and my iPhone and in a few hours the workout will eventually appear.

WHile I have had frequent response from Strava support, it‚Äôs usually repeating the same things over and over....they seem to think that having to reboot frequently is acceptable, or blaming in on weak WiFi.

Time to give up.This app does what it‚Äôs intended for but falls very short in long term goals. This tracks your ride but you will begin to see bugs where activities aren‚Äôt ever recorded in your history, despite you starting the recording. 

This is immensely frustrating since this app bugs out and never records my really long activities. 

I‚Äôm riding around for 2 hours thinking it will record, nope it doesn‚Äôt. 

The auto start feature is utter garbage. No way to turn it off and it bothers you as soon as you want to even open the app. Why do you automatically start an activity once the app opens?! I just want to view other things in app but it does this every time, wasting your time on the app.strava, if you‚Äôre reading this, your decision to make segment leaderboards a premium feature is real dirty. if this had been the way it was all along, than that would be a whole different story, but updating the app just to make segments only available to view if you have premium, real messed up. a lot of people have been using segments as a normal feature of the app for so long, and it was a great way to see how you stand up against your friends. but i know i speak for the majority of users when i say that there is absolutely no chance that i will be paying a premium fee for this. i really hope you rethink this decision.",0,JTempoP Daddiocrankwerks86snowbdr440wvayensSwitching2AppleMusic120enraged senior student,"Great for casual but seriously lacking elsewhereCan‚Äôt view current paceMiddle of a pandemic, more users...lets decontent the app!It‚Äôs good for social athletes.Time to say goodbyGreat at start, terrible in long run.very disappointed that segments are now only premium features",StravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStravaStrava,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,7,0,966,has_narrative,32

Maybe I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic here but the reality is I don‚Äôt have money kicking around for a Strava subscription. I accept that there are going to be aspects of the app that I won‚Äôt have access to, however I would maintain that to this point the [free] app was of 5 star quality and a must have workout tracker. After the update is an entirely different story, however. The free app has been stripped to the bare bones, no more access to segment leaderboards...I can‚Äôt even view my own previous times on segments. Honestly I leave a 3 star rating because I have loved using Strava for the past few years, in reality I should really leave a 1 star review. If you are able to afford the cost of a subscription to Strava, then by all means, it is a great app that is a fun and useful tool for tracking your workouts...BUT, I would not personally recommend the app as it currently stands unless you don‚Äôt have any other option available.While I consider Strava to be the best activity tracking social media platform on the market, it can still be better. The ability to group pedal assist rides with normal rides or as a stand alone heatmap would be super nice because the user workaround is to define a pedal assist ride as a normal ride which I‚Äôm certain aggravates users focused on segments. Another improvement would be to search ride history by bike ridden. 

Remember, if you don‚Äôt continue to improve a product or service, it‚Äôs fairly certain your competitors will catch and or pass you. 

From a happy user looking to help.I use Strava only casually. The last two updates have been pretty disappointing. Using the free version, you used to be able to see weekly progress compared to the previous week. You used to be able to see your speeds for matched runs in your history. Both of these features were removed in the last two updates! Now you have to pay a subscription fee for those features! I know they have to make money somehow but removing features isn‚Äôt going to win you any fans.While the phone app is great when working, the Apple Watch app is buggy. The Apple watch app recently consistently forgets that I‚Äôm signed into Strava on my phone and treats me like a new user until I do an elaborate watch restart process with the Strava app open on my phone. Also, after a run, it occasionally doesn‚Äôt sync properly to load the run and I need to manually go into history and sync it.",0,SNSH86Blackpass55monodistortionCapMJS,"New Update - May 20, 2020Strava could be betterRemoving features to make you payWatch app is buggy",StravaStravaStravaStrava,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,4,0,462,has_narrative,32

It syncs up to most other apps and devices. 
Good analyses of meta data to help you understand your training history and metrics.
Cons:
The UI is not flexible. This app still seems analog in so many ways with regards to being a social app and allowing features and data from other apps to be used and synced.I am one of the free riders apparently. I would think strava receives significant advertising revenue based on what I see in my strava feed. I will need to evaluate whether to subscribe or use something else to track my workouts in the future. So far I‚Äôve loved the free version and it has been a helpful resource to improving my workouts and health.

Now its showing a few random not interesting segments, I have to click all segments and when im there its hard to find the interesting segments because the stars are gone.

I first started to track my rides to know how far I go in a day, why dont Strava show total distance for the day? I used to get around that problem with connecting to health, and I could see total distance of the day in health, but that function stopped working.I‚Äôve been using Strava for three or four years. The first couple of years, I kept up my handwritten journal record of each ride, but then just sort of stopped, because I can describe each ride and add photos on Strava, so why bother? My only fear is what if Strava goes away and then I lose all that history? I wish I could make a printed album of all my Strava rides!
One thing that Strava brings out for better or for worse is my competitive nature.

The achievement system gamifies my runs and the monthly fitness levels keep me self aware of my training on a longer term level. I also like how it automatically detects when I do the same route, and then gives me a history of my performance on that same route / activity / run / ride.

Good data - there‚Äôs no substitute.   Viewing other athletes work history has helped me prepare.  Example:  I completed the Rock Ridge Darkside back in July.  150 miles of Flint Hills epic goat jeep path lunacy in the dark.  Electronics failed.  Lost.  Off course.   Started at 9PM.    Finished the next day just before the Noon cutoff.   Ironically No data captured for that event - but it was the first since accident‚Ä¶.  And Strava helped get me there!I really enjoy being able to see my and others data, explore new routes, analyze fitness tracking, and have one place where my fitness life story is found. Strava links with so many devices and websites and does a great job with a mostly add free feel.  I do wish they had a dark mode as I hate looking at the bright screen planning tomorrows adventure right before I go to bed.I‚Äôve been using the Strava app for several years now and love it. It‚Äôs great being able to track achievements, history and progress. It‚Äôs fun to follow other riders and to be followed and cheered on.

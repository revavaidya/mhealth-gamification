Yeah, there are all the popular hikes you would expect, but it is awesome finding the trails that people don’t know about.

Last weekend we found a 20ft waterfall from a trailhead that only had 4 parking spots and no signage.

4,neg,2020-07-04 15:45:19,"I love many things about All Trails, including the detailed descriptions, maps, and user reviews on the different hikes. However, I think it’s a bit sad, and a little messed up, that you have to pay so much money to be able to download a trail. I feel this way because on many trails, you lose service, and without service, you can’t open this app to see if you are on the right path. Moreover, getting lost without service is one of the most dangerous times to get lost! So, I wish they would let you download at least a few maps with the free version. Otherwise, this app is pointless once you are actually on the trail, unless you pay the fee, which isn’t even a one-time fee. 
We use a different app when actually are hiking so that we can see where we are going, but All Trails is great to plan hikes and get an idea of what sort of views and challenges you will come across!",0,Awesome but Expensive,Roberts1018,0,All Trails Hike Bike Run,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,170,has_challenges,5

I ride an Adventure Bike (GS 1200) and the reviews are great to research various trails to determine if I’m able to do them or how much effort the trail will require. The GS 1200 is a BIG motorcycle and I like knowing if there are “Rock Gardens”, massive ruts, steep declines, etc.  Other users often give distances to significant trail challenges which comes in handy!!!  Of course, remember that trail conditions change constantly so don’t ride wild based on reviews...

The one addition that is needed (in my opinion) is an additional FILTER Category of “Adventure Riding” or “Off Road Motorcycling”.  It’s easy enough to use “Off Road Driving” to identify trails that are open to Off Road Riding but the numerous trail user write ups is mostly from rock crawlers or 4x4’ers.  I often read these when I’m out and about riding the trails and it would make reviewing up and coming trails much quicker.

1,neg,2019-07-24 05:06:142021-12-10 16:37:28,"I bought this app a couple of days ago and tried to use it for a backpacking trip in a nearby national forest. Firstly, the app’s maps didn’t match the park’s trail maps AT ALL, so I decided to take both with me of course. As I went on, it seemed like the AllTrails version was just random gps points that had been made up. We were somewhat in the general area but absolutely could not have used it to find our way anywhere out there. 
I tried it again on another trail when we got back just to see and it wasn’t accurate either! Most of them have been, but if even some of them aren’t, then I cannot trust it. I planned to use this product for multi-day trips but it seems super unsafe now. 
The worst part is, when I went to request a refund for the above reasons, I got immediate denied (without anyone even looking into my claim) and it’s near impossible to get ahold of anyone at AllTrails. So, that’s $60 that I’ll never see again for a product that I’ll certainly never use. 
I do not recommend this product! The free version for simple day hikes was great. But if you want it for anything more in depth, this is not the right app for you!This app is very slow. It will not toggle between trails and takes way too long to search or open a map. Not all maps are correct. It is a good app for a basic hiker. But if you have any navigation skills or knowledge of hiking then this app is too elementary (and slow). It also does not keep track of your progress even with the pro feature. After a hike it immediately wants you to review the hike and will not show your stats or let you go to another map without first doing so, or closing the app and re-opening. I mapped a great trail today, but can not share because of the invalidity of the app. Will share on mapmyhike! Super bummed that the information is not saved. Also, it only shows one way hike data. So, if you are starting at a different end or going a different way on a loop it will not show correct data. There is no way to connect trails either. No real trail information, very basic. Doesn’t show mileage points or points of interest.

I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I used it all the time for both work and recreation for hiking, exploring different cities, planning trips, and even a very basic form of GIS that anyone could use. The last update that they did in October 2021 eliminated some of the best features such as dropping way points along the trail route and adding photos to a trail route. My only assumption is that they are trying to get people to buy the pro version but all they did is make me dislike the app so much I’d rather just not use it at all and use something else instead. 

Thanks for nothing! Don’t waste your time downloading this if you want to record memories and remember where things are along the trail.I had high hopes for AllTrails. It tracks very well and handles waypoints well but uploading photos and synchronizing across devices is problematic. After returning from a home I submitted the recording and then attempted to edit from my laptop. I could edit my description very easily but changes failed to appear on my device a half hour later. I also attempted to upload photos from my camera card to the hike - 15 minutes and still waiting. My Internet is slow but not that slow - I can upload files and photos to other apps without problem. I keep working with it because I can find no alternative but it may simply be more trouble than it’s worth for general use. I’m using the Pro version.This app is good for finding trails of potential interest, but that’s about the only positive thing I can say about it.  I have the Pro version and have many complaints, primarily with how little planning/navigation functionality there is.  Waypoints cannot even be added on the mobile app, and for an app with so little functionality, it sure has a clumsy and unintuitive user interface.  If you are only interested in finding new trails or want to upload your own experiences for others to read, then it might be for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere in my opinion, or at least be sure to try out the free version before paying for Pro.I have 2 major complaints: When I record a hike I cannot note that it’s a private recording. As soon as my phone returns to service the hike gets uploaded for all the world to see.  No thanks! Secondly, my running and cycling are now showing up under completed activities. Sorry AllTrails- I don’t want you to track my athletic pursuits. You are there when I am on a trail and I don’t want to get off it. You are also handy for getting other opinions about a prospective trail. Please correct these 2 major points or this user will be hiking over to another app that doesn’t have these newly created issues.While AllTrails has gotten a little bit better about PAYING USERS accessing the app through a VPN (They used to block paying users through a bot check loop), you still lose a lot of the information that the app is supposed to provide. No live data will load over a VPN, so no weather, no UV index, no description, no waypoints. If a VPN is interrupting data delivery, they are doing something shady with their data.

They should be at least color coded among waypoints. 
It would also be vastly more useful if the photos on each trail could be viewed sequentially, so that you can flip through them in the order that they were taken on the trail. Otherwise it’s just a disorganized mess of a trail. 
Finally, it would be really helpful if we could view reviews of the trail by month. It’s nice to be able to look at reviews from the previous year when planning ahead, because reviewers note weather, bugs, etc without scrolling through pages and pages of reviews in a season when you’re not looking to hike. 
These improvements would make it a priceless resource!Just recently noticed the pictures and some maps are not loading at all. Thought it was my iPad but it’s doing the same on my phone as well

One thing I really wish was changed is the altitude and mileage tracker on the bottom of the topography maps. One, it’s small to begin with because it’s on a phone screen and your finger hides most of the information when you’re sliding. It should have its own slider underneath the graph so I don’t have to try to look under my finger to see information. Two, I hate that the mileage points are not evenly spaced out. It goes from 1.2 to 3.6 to 5.1. It should be broken up into half or quarter mile increments to easily calculate distances. Furthermore, I know it shows you altitude in real time in the upper left hand corner as you’re sliding on the graph so why can’t it show you mileage as well? These hanged would be UBER helpfulAT has the best community of hikers submitting trails and waypoints for sure, and when the app works it is awesome! However it is not bulletproof at all. Crashes occasionally on even a new iPhone and the watch app is pretty much unusable - crashes and unsyncs often, only way to resync is to restart the phone app and even then...(it seems to have something to do with the size of the AllTrails maps if you are not connected to Internet because it crashes when you try to load in a map - wish it could just be set to show stats. Map on phone current pace and stuff on watch). If the devs work out the bugs it will be a great if expensive subscription. Until then, recommend just browsing website for trails and using another GPS app for backcountry navigation when you are away from internet access.Dislikes:
1. Can’t set a default activity type. Every time I save a trail  I have to remember to change the activity from hiking to off road. I am usually tired and want to head straight home after a ride and want save the trail quickly.
2. Too many acknowledgements when taking a photo. Should take you to the photo app immediately. Should not ask you if you want to take a photo after you select photo.
3. Way, way too slow at startup. I usually start it up and find something else too do when I open the app. 
4. Wish directions feature would provide an alternate trail starting point when available. Entering a trail at original starting point can add a ridiculous amount travel time getting to the trail.
5. Zooming function is slow, recenter function is inconsistent, and tracking current drive is inconsistent. Sometimes the app doesn’t follow my drive after I recenter. Sometimes recenter retains the last zoom setting and sometimes it doesn’t.

Likes:
1. Easy too use for planning trips 
2. Downloadable maps. A must for any app like this.
3. A good variety of downloadable maps.
4. I like being able to add waypoints in case I want to return to a trail in the future.Overall I like having a trail map that I can follow and not get lost. The reviews help ensure the description matches reality. However I have paid for the full version and still some key things are missing that seem obvious and there’s no way I can find to communicate with the developers. 

The main problem is you can’t download the layers such as waypoints. Most hikes have no cell service so there is no way to access this key feature while you’re on the trail. So all you get is a red line with zero info including the blaze colors you should be looking for. There also no way to contribute to waypoints which would allow users to clarify and update the map for other users. 

The other part I find extremely frustrating is there is no map to show adjoining trails so if you want to switch trails while you’re hiking you won’t have a map. Therefore I can only use this app in conjunction with Avenza meaning I have to pay twice  

I haven’t found a full service map app that combines All Trails and Avenza. Hoping there’s an enthusiast out there working on a good interactive trail map that would be like Waze for hiking.I use the app weekly to keep records of my waypoints when I use the navigation option. The last update is not really intuitive , for example the position of the Pause / Resume button in Navigation is A BAD idea when using an iPhone that has no home button because the swipe up on these iPhone acts as a home button and you would hit that Pause button by mistake while swiping up so pls locate that button in a different location. Also the last update involves too many clicks to get one simple job done- as much as I like the modern interface of the updates I really miss how intuitive the old version was.I am disappointed in the most recent update. I rely on waypoint markings as GPS points to use on iNaturalist for my photography. When marking the waypoints in the field, I select the option for my named waypoints to show on the map. The names of the waypoints I’ve assigned show while actively using the app, however the names do not show on the map once I save my hike and close it. This did not happen in the previous version. I hope this glitch is fixed soon, particularly for the paid version. I also find the congratulations and high five every time I mark a waypoint annoying and artificial, as well as when I save my hike.I have been using the app (pro version) for a few weeks now. Most of the app is wonderfully helpful and uaedul.

One improvement can be to add the ability to see “remaining distance” for a hike. Just saw that “remaining time” feature was added. The pace differs from person to person and so that is not very helpful.

Ideally one plans few way points for a full hike. It is useful to identify (mark) waypoints and get a “remaining distance to the next waypoint” presented as a motivator to accomplish planned goals and keep to a planned schedule.

The offline maps show the GPS location on the map and the elevation at the point can be seen. So I am surprised why not the remaining distance to the next waypoint or end of the trail?

I also see that the interface to using a “pause” in the middle of the hike is very unintuitive. Pause state changed to hold after a few seconds -  not sure what that implies. Realized that a long hold on the hold moves to a different UI state that has a resume option.Fun app for finding new hikes, even in areas where I consider myself fairly knowledgeable. Two issues when using an iPad: the app was designed for a phone and does not fully scale to an iPad; my Favorites do not sync with my phone or the website from my iPad (and vice versa) without deleting the app and reloading it. So when I browse on my iPad the saved trails do not populate on my phone, or if I use a web browser any new favorites do not show up on my iPad. Also, is there a way to upload AllTrails waypoints/maps to my Garmin watch (would be the killer app)?I used to LOVE this app. So much so that I started paying for it. However, I just deleted my subscription after having major issues with it not showing me all of map information that it used to. I don’t live near very many trails, which never used to be an issue, but now it’s showing me even fewer trails that it did before. It also isn’t showing me map layers at all, like waypoints. I’m not sure why this happened, but it seemed to have changed with a recent update. Unfortunately, this app is just not what it used to be…. Oh well.One of my main goals for using the app was to track my hiking history and compare hikes. 

First gap I encountered was the inability to add hikes from before I installed the app. I have been hiking for years and most of the trails I’ve hiked are in the trail database. It should be straightforward to add a hikes distance and elevation gain using start and end waypoints to my history. 

Second issue was when inspecting the trails on the map you can’t select 2 waypoints and see the distance and elevation gain between the two. 

Lastly when looking at the list of waypoints on a trail, the only statistic shown are the coordinates. Seems very strange to omit the elevation and the distance from the trailhead here. Including estimated hike times would be hugely useful for planning. Most park maps include this and this app has actual telemetry data to use here as well.  

In short, not a very good cataloging or planning tool. It’s a tracker, little more.It’s not verifying trails as completed anymore and even when it works it doesn’t do so as quickly. It’s been weeks since I completed 2 trails and it still won’t verify it. Last time it did it updated the next day. Now it just says complete. In the past it updated it in less than a minute. I take pride in being verified. Fix it alltrails. Also bring back that point system that reminded me of Gamerscore points on Xbox. For example I had 48,000 or so now it doesn’t show that.I watched the tutorial videos and still have no idea how to use the app. I have tried creating a route and downloading a map. I don’t know if the map was downloaded and literally have spent over an hour trying to creat a route. I can get lots of waypoints on the map but how do you connect them?  I’m pretty savvy and obviously this is user error but it’s not user friendly at all. Super frustrating. It will be an awesome tool once I learn how to use it.

I use this app every single weekend to make 1-3 maps for my weekend trips without fail and this app is crucial and I really do love it so much. Here is my only complaint.. in order to keep my true walking pace (excluding breaks) I will pause my activity . If I forget to “resume activity” then the distance I hike until I realize that I did not press “resume” is essentially lost. I did not teleport 3 miles down the trail.. there HAS to be a way to resolve this . This is a simple human error and I cannot be the only one who is frustrated by this. When that happens, the entire distance tracking is thrown off and there is a large gap on the map as well as miles completed. There needs to be an auto fill that bases your pace on the current time and since the time activity was paused when it notices a gap on the trail. It just needs to be filled in because the gps locates and pinpoints you on the section of the trail that you are on but assumes you did not walk there.. please find a way to solve this.Sometimes I forget to stop my navigation recording and it of course then records my drive home. My mistake, BUT I wish I could go back into the saved recording and simply omit information, just by cutting it off after a time mark or waypoint. It’s frustrating as it really messes up my stats, either I keep the insane recording where it may add 70 miles hiked in an hour or I have to delete a 20 mile hike entirely. Seems like it would be easy and I can’t believe I’m the only one who forgets to stop recording after a long day.

CUSTOM POINT TO POINT routing and navigation would be a major feature to use.  I would personally like feature that generated a trail route based on my selected start and end points and waypoints.As of late this app is slow, the downloads are slow, and it locks up. Maybe I have too many trail maps downloaded but it’s only a fraction of the map layers and map areas I have downloaded using GAIA Pro. If I don’t need to create and save waypoints, or record my track, I use AllTrails or the WTA Trailblazer app. But AllTrails is now too unresponsive to use.I downloaded the All Trails App at the recommendation of the majority of people I’ve reached out to while looking for a good hiking app. While it appears to be a great app for charting and tracking a trail that you, or another user, has hiked, there doesn’t appear to be an option for dropping waypoints and planning for a hike that you haven’t yet hiked...

However, most trail data is collected through people actually hiking the trails themselves, so distances may actually be longer depending on the circumstances. 17 miles can turn into 25 real quick. Do your research and cross reference any trail you find, especially for longer trails. Overall I have loved hiking with this app for several years now and it makes trip planning super easy.The database is comprehensive. I love how trail routes come together as AllTrails custom routes. The safety tracker feature in Pro was a hit with my loved ones when I hit the trail for a few days.

It’s disappointing that you can’t engage others in the community by communicating with them via chat threads: “Hey, you traveled the trail this morning. See any water?”

It’s good at searching in your own 60 mile radius.

I’ve noticed that it’s bad at searching outside of your current location and region. It should be a killer trail database and it could be if it were better searchable. For example) what if I want to search all of Wisconsin for a loop trail greater than 20 miles, moderate difficulty. All the data is available. I’d expect it to only let me search within 60 miles of waypoints and towns. It might also reset my search context to my location while I’m researching.  Searching outside one’s own region could be so much better.I have been really enjoying my All Trails AP! I do a lot of outdoor activities such as backpacking, hiking, wilderness camping, kayaking, canoeing, hunting and fishing. I’m always looking for good maps. Especially good ones with trails marked and way points. This one even has photos and reviews from other outdoors people who’ve been to these places before. Tons of useful information and map layers to aid with navigation. Love the suggestion of other nearby trails too. I’ll be definitely recommending this AP to all my outdoor enthusiast friends!The app is great. A few tweaks with the app freezing here and there would help. Also, supplying the physical address of start points/end points (if different) for each hike would make the adventure much more manageable. I know sometimes that’s not possible but overall it would be a great addition to the app. Thank you for making this fantastic app for us adventurers, you are appreciated! Sincerely, Daniel P Dalpe and the hiking community!Great app. Only problem I see, is the trail. not as accurate as it needs to be. But it’s understandable!  Only as good as info entered.

One of my BIGGEST complaints is that you can not ask questions or comment on peoples reviews. You can’t direct message people... why??? What if you’d like to know some information someone just hiked a trail could answer for you? Or try to meet up with other members for hikes? Or just comment and praise other people for their reviews and photos? Really a huge downfall so I had to remove a star for that.

Additionally, it’s crazy how you can NOT drop pins, or markers to mark different locations, potential campsites, shelters, water sources, bridges, downed trees or passages blocked. And you can NOT click on any of the map details for information.
Very basic short comings... :/

It would be great if these could be future updates, people could search for pins others have dropped, water sources and shelters. Users could verify one another by confirming those things are accurate and there, earning points and giving other people searching for pins the options to pick from the most reliable pins (most verified) or most reliable people (person that always leave correct information) this would also boost followers for people that are active and add this useful information.I have the pro version and before this recent update I was always able to look up trails- even when I didn’t have reception!  Now I have to look them up before I go and download them beforehand. A little annoying because sometimes we will change our mind and choose a different trail in the area. Also the red map lines are now written over the names of the trails! Really frustrating! Sometimes the names of hikes don’t match up to the route drawn, so I always like to zoom in and double check. Especially when hiking in the smokies. I also can’t read the distance points on the maps anymore. The red lines are written over those too. Please fix this!!!!!

Just saying. Now back to the review. First off I should mention that I’ve tried a lot of hiking apps and this one is by far my favorite. It renders trails in the maps that never show up on other apps so that was a big plus. The information it gives on these trails is jam packed, and with an amazing community, you can see what real people have to say about the trail you’re thinking about hiking. After I hike a trail, I make sure I write a review and give as much personal information about it that I’d want the next hikers to know. I’m not the only one either, I don’t hike a trail without looking it up on this app and seeing what others think about it. Aside from others input on trails, this app has everything else you need to know about a hike… waypoints (very important so you don’t get lost), expected weather, elevation gain, and something I thought was very helpful… a ‘Getting There’ tab. Sometimes finding a trail is difficult but this tab makes it simple and stress free.I would never be doing the amount of hiking and places I’m exploring if it weren’t for AllTrails app and website. Could not imagine a couple years ago all the different places I would see and many within just a couple hours drive which I was unaware of. When hiking alone, best to know exactly where you can park and condition of trails and this does a fantastic job with the amount of pictures and detailed reviews left by the AllTrails community.

The recording feature is great to have to help you remember what you saw after doing many trails (upload photos, mark various waypoints, etc). You can even map out a custom map in advance and load it into the recorder so will notify you if you start getting off course. The various stats it displays are a nice encouragement as well in comparing past hikes/months to see how much to further challenge yourself.

Absolutely love this app! I can’t imagine how many more people are probably getting out there more often because of AllTrails. Well done!This app is super helpful in planning a hike!  Shows all nearby trails by popularity, difficulty level, trail map, waypoints, photos and trails eviews.  Proved to be very accurate and usable.  We tried few easy and moderate trails and thoroughly enjoyed them.  One improvement in UI is it loses current position marker when you lock the phone.  You have to go back to navigate screen to refresh current location.  I primarily used in locations that had network.  if you are planning to go to remote locations,  it is better to download offline map (supported in paid pro subscription).  Alltrails app helped more than once when we went on the wrong path.  I was able to quickly consult the trail map and backtrack to correct pathAll Trails is an absolute must have tool for adventurists and outdoor enthusiasts. Whenever we travel, I am always on all trails before we go and saving my favorite trails to a list. I also love that I can sort by so many different filters and discover dog friendly trails (and ones that aren’t so we know to leave him home) The GPS to take you the the beginning of the trail head is amazing as Apple Maps has taken us way off base before. I love this app and I highly recommend if you love hiking or trail walking, bike riding or just scenic views. There are plenty of lookout points in the app for those who can’t hike or bike or for those uncooperative weather days!I love AllTrails for its detailed coverage of, well, all trails. I love how easy it is to see the whole trail from an arial view so I can plan my hike. I’m impressed with the level of detail and how well the GPS tracks me on the trail even when I’m out of cellular range.

But I don’t love that I can’t browse a map, find something that looks interesting, and drop a couple of pins to figure out the distance and elevation gain between those points. I either have to extrapolate from the map data, or I record it when I walk and then save it in my history. Those options are little help for planning.I love being able to create my own routes wherever I want to go. I’ve created maps for off trail, for biking, for long backpacking trips. What’s really great is the community let’s you know where they found great campsite, and that’s usually one of the hardest things to figure out when you’re going to a new location. Being able to put In waypoints, being able to switch from AllTrails, to USGS maps, to Satellite are features I use consistently. I run a small nonprofit in NC (The American Adventure Service Corps- Lake Norman) that takes kids 8-18 into our wild places and AllTrails is super useful to our mission! Highly recommended.I have the free version and I can’t tell you that it didn’t disappoint so far , for showing you all the trails and being able to choose trails while you’re on the trails i give this app a 5*. I share it with other friends and they downloaded right away. Now i guess some bad reviews have some good points if you pay for the pro version and doesn’t meet the expectations but for what i use it and compared with the fancy ones out there and trust me I tried all of them , All Trails is the most i use it and I deleted all the other ones..Look, I've read over a few of these reviews and responses from alltrails. This app is designed to provide users with plenty of info and details regards trails in your area and it does just that. I HIGHLY recommend the PRO version. You can use the app offline and download any map you want. The overlays and additional map points and details are unmatched on any outdoor trail app ANYWHERE. I AM A VERY EXPERIENCED hiker and I know my way around. However, this app makes me SMART as a hiker and it is excellent for planning, tracking, navigation, etc. I love to record hikes and check photos of other hikers too. IMO. this is the best app out thereHas been using this for three years and find it very useful for hiking, running and biking.
Few points which are would make it even better than what it already is:
- in a search by park/area - list all associated trails in the park
- being able to see activities, history&stats by type of activities. i.e. hiking, biking etcThis is a great app.  Love that it works off line. Love the elevations so you can plan the day/rests on the trail. Love that you can mark points among the trail, but wish you could add pics and text after the fact. I don't like to stop on the trail to do the social media part - I’d like to do that after we are finished and sitting around with our shoes off reminiscing about the day over a drink!It’s quite an amazing app! It works even without connection. Even if you don’t download and pay for the premium features, there’s still all the necessary features that you need! Me and my boyfriend recently used it on a hike and it was so cool to see where we’ve been and our elevation at certain points! 5/5 recommend it!Hi! This might be silly but since I just started hiking it’s a problem for me. I feel like it would be very helpful to have that arrow that points to the direction you’re facing, on the map (like on Apple or Google maps). That way it’s a lot quicker and easier to tell what direction I have to go in. Other than that, fantastic app so far!My girlfriend and I use this every time we go hiking.  It’s fun to map your routes and record them. Definitely upgrade to pro it’s come in very handy in the back country. Download the maps first and you will be able to track your progress on that particular trail also set waypoints for other hikers.This app is really awesome and I highly recommend it. My wife, dogs, and I hike several times a year and try to do new trails as much as we can and this app NEVER disappoints.

Now, let’s down to business.  This app blows on SO many levels, I’m astonished that it is still in business.

1) They offer no way to contact them directly.
2) Uploaded photos are not posted.  They disappear.  Photos that appear in my profile, don’t appear on the trails.
3) There is no way to leverage the power of community.
4) You can’t post questions and get feedback.
5) You can’t make corrections to trails, whose maps are often imprecise or wrong.

Pros:
1. I can find maps of trails and download them before getting to the trailhead where I won't have any service.
2. I can make a map of a route I have taken or want to take. 
Cons: 
1. I have to know what trail I'm going to hike instead of exploring around, bc a map won't show up without having downloaded a trail map prior.
2. I cannot share my maps with others unless they open it on their desktop.

Love the posted photos so you can get an idea of views you will encounter. I love the fact that Printed maps show an elevation guide. Very cool that you can view a trail, and then see “nearby trails” allowing you to quickly assess what’s available in a given area. 
The reason for 4 stars is that the program needs  several improvements 1) the trail creation features are not simple to access and use and can snap onto the wrong segment and can be problematic to close on loop trails for accurate distance measurement. 2) maps only print at specific ratios (not perfectly zoom customizable) so often trail is printed too small or large. I often have to split trail into 2-3 pages to get good detail. 3) the chosen route prints as a continuous red line and covers up the forest service trail numbers... forcing you to hand label printed maps with the #s if you are linking trails etc. Those deficiencies aside, AllTrails is an amazing tool to plan. It’s given me the confidence to discover and hike trails I would have never attempted otherwise. App is nice for downloaded trail map. GPS point can help confirm  current location which is reassuring!This has been my go to app for tracking my Hikes. Two improvements would make this five stars 1.

I use the app for all my hiking! I love the record feature that allows me to track my progress on any hike, and I love even more that I can put my phone on airplane mode so that I’m not using data while on my hike and still use the record feature! I always check out the All Trails reviews from other hikers before heading out, and usually find that other hikers have great insight/feedback about trail conditions. The only feature I don’t love about All Trails is the rating technique that is used for hiking trails. Trails are rated as either easy/moderate/hard and I have found through my experience that trails aren’t very consistently rated. I’ve hiked some trails that were rated as hard and the hike felt easy. I’ve hiked some rated as moderate and the hike felt hard. I understand that rating trails is a challenging component of hiking due to different levels of experience and fitness, however I would love to see an option where hikers who have completed the hike are able to submit their feedback on how challenging the hike was from 1-10. I think, overall, a 1-10 scale for how challenging a hike is would be extremely beneficial. Overall, I absolutely love All Trails and use the app daily! I recommend it to anyone and fully support what they are doing! Keep up the great work, All Trails!We have been using this app to find trails for a few weeks now and it’s been great. Being able to download maps for offline use is a lifesaver when you are trekking through less traveled areas, and some trailheads would be impossible to find without the guidance this app provides. I do find that reviews from recent users can be misleading as everyone is at a different fitness level and looking for different kinds of adventure, but most people try to provide helpful feedback that helps us decide what trails to do with our kids and which ones to skip until they are a little older. Overall totally worth the 30 bucks/year!I’m a veteran hiker who knows his way around topos, GPS’s and such. This app is a great amalgam of all of it as well as how to get to the trailhead and what others think. Kind of like finding a local outdoor outfitter and asking for advice but without the randomness of getting the person who knows what they’re talking about. It’s also like the manifold “best hikes” guides but it’d be 3 feet thick and with crowd sourced feedback. I use it wherever I hike now but I still carry an old school compass and paper map. It’s a great app all right but if your batteries die, you lose signal or trash your phone you’d better have backup.With gps to get you there and gps while on the trail that can literally track your every move, you can explore new trails and even explore venture off the one you are on safely since you can always navigate back onto your trail by referring to the app. Reviews and summary are also great feedback to help you pick the right trail for the day! There is a record feature that lots of folks use too... so you can share your adventure with others. I also love the layers feature so you can see your trail from a variety of perspectives..Alltrails has helped me find a lot of places to go for wonderful outside adventures. I love how detailed you can get with the filters to find exactly what you’re looking for, I love that I can read other users feedback about certain trails, I love that you can download and save trails to both save them for later and be able to view them when there’s no cell service and I love how user-friendly it is. Truly a well designed, well executed and very useful app. Thank you!If you like to hike paying for this app is 1000% worth it! Directions straight to any trailhead, tracking lots at elements of your hike and feedback from other users. Best feature is the ability to download maps then you can use your phone to keep on the trail for the whole hike. The app is continuously updated and improved. Sometimes the mileage can be a bit off but I think they take an average of the different hikes from people tracking.I love to track all the trails that we accomplished so we can remember which ones we already adventured and see the future trips we want to conquer. Also love seeing the feedbacks so we don’t waste our time since we have dogs with us. This app truly helps to know what we should expect on each trail before even going:)I love this app. I love being able to make a list of places to go, I can mark a list of hikes that I have completed, and if other people have done the hike you can get real feedback about their experience which is great. And you can always get a brief description of each trail, and directions to the trail. I love this app. If you hike or bike, you must have this app.Since the gyms are closed my friend and I took up hiking with the help of a friend who started before us. All trails has been an amazing help to us in discovering so so many options and with the feedback from others, it really helps especially since we are new to it😊I almost didn’t renew but it’s such a helpful, handy resource for hitting the trails. You can find this info on an internet search but it’s so much better within the app. The comments part with feedback from recent hikers is really helpful.  Also for safety, I like being able to gps myself during a hike. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Use it every week. Great reviews. Updates continuously keep coming, which is amazing. Well worth paying for pro to have access to so many hikes, information and reviews. The trial preview feature is incredible keep up the great work, All Trails!!!Been over 6months since I left a feedback that all
reviews can’t be read on the app. I was asked to use the web app to read all reviews. As good as this is, docking all stars for not fixing a bug even 6 months laterGreat apps for hiking and biking. The apps provides information on hiking trails at your location , elevation, maps for the trails, pictures, feedback and reviews. You can sort by distance or difficulties. Get an overview of the trails before you hike to determine if the trail is a loop trail on round-about trail.Required app for maintaining sanity during business trips. With this app I can fill as little as 60 minutes with a great experience and be  certain I’ll make my next flight even if I’ve never been to the area before. Great mapping, directions, and trail feedback. Highly recommended.I use this app ALL the time!!! 
It’s so helpful for finding trails and all the details you need to know about them as well! 
Love that you can gps track and see all the ins and outs of what to expect from the trail- plus see other reviews where people can provide their own feedback on the trail.

Love the map and list views and that you can filter your searches based on what you are looking for in a hike. 
You can use it anywhere - I’m in Georgia and went on vacation in Hawaii and was wonderful! 

If you hike - get this!

Hi there,

Thank you for the information and that helps clarify your issue. We have recently made some changes to the app that affects the offline search capabilities which is why you are not able to load content when you do not have connection.

It's always a balance between app size and offline functionality for us. We previously built an offline index while the app was launching that loaded local trail data on to your device so the search functionality could be used offline. However in order to build that index it had some very negative and frustrating affects to the app, such as extremely long start up times.

We have removed this offline index of trails in order to improve app performance and not overwhelm your device which unfortunately has removed the ability to search for trails when offline.How are you going to ask me to spend $30 on an app that completely does not work? Downloaded this app yesterday to use for a hike yesterday and today and even after multiple times uninstalling and reinstalling and even restarting my device, this app refuses to work. Says I need an internet connection to do anything even though I clearly have plenty of connection and even on WiFi. Like I can’t even do the basic functions of this app, but it wants to constantly push this membership fee so I can unlock the features. What a complete joke.I know that only the paid subscription allows you to download the map. But it’s ridiculous that every time the app opens from the task manager, the app forced to clear the cache of the map and have to acquire internet connection to download the map data again. This is an awful and disappointing decision as some of the people might on the free version, and may walk to some place that does not have cellular reception. People could get lost if they don’t stay on the app. This is gross and unacceptable.I have pro version. I liked the old version. The new version is terrible. I tried to create new offline map and download map layer. It just locked up. The procedure won’t finish. I have to cycle the power of iPhone. There are other issues as well. When hike from WiFi area to no connection the application just stopped record. Show “no connection” “do you wish to continue?”. It hangs when answering phone call. We do not want the fancy function. Just want it work normally. I used to like it a lot. Now I just hate it.Bottom line: This is not an app for people who hike or bike, this is a social media app that aims primarily to monetize your friends network and gamify your favorite activities to keep you engaged and paying. 

I paid, then discovered that some of the most popular trails in America are not listed. I found that some trails on their map didn’t exist (this could be actually dangerous), and that it ate battery for lunch. 

There has to be a better way (I’m sure there is). For now I’m sticking with tried and true paper map and compass.",1,"JunkOffline map index gone, basic app useless to us poor/strugglingMaybe make sure the version of the app actually works before releasing it, maybe.Disgusting.. always want to force you to payThe Update was NightmaresNot all trails, “Some hikes”",J-maxxHapalapBrewerDude67KaikaikaicnNoname 无名英雄#1didhdhdhsv,"{'id': 17474022, 'body': 'Hi there - thank you for the feedback.

I’ve been using the Pro version of this app for over 6 years and it seems to me that you keep switching features around catering more to a social media look, which is fine. But I am not sure where you get the user experience input because I can tell you that it’s not us, the long time users. I rely heavily on my history to find previously used tracks I built and hiked. Last year you put the historical activity on a different tab, harder to locate. Fine, I guess, more cumbersome but I have adjusted. With the version released a couple of weeks ago, you made it even more cumbersome to get to, not intuitive at all, it’s now under profile! 
To make matters even worse, you didn’t add a search feature on the activity history on the app!!! I had to read the FAQ’s and community comments (read complaints) to find out it’s only available on the computer. 
This is unacceptable. Especially after you increased the price of the subscription this year. 
Please fix the app and add the history back. To make it better, put the history back on a more intuitive and less cumbersome to find location. 
I’m really considering switching to another app if this is not something you will fix soon.Scratch every positive review I have ever given this app in the past. I’ve been using (and paying for) it for years, it used to be good. When people complained about it not being accurate I actually defended it. But not after my experience this year. 
I have been using it for every hike and it only tracks about 20% of my mileage. Constantly pausing on its own, hardly works if you have no internet connection (even after downloading everything). The only time it does work is if you have the app open with your phone out in front of you while you are hiking. Ridiculous.
It’s not just me, my hiking partner has experienced this as well.
The only thing it’s good for is to find hikes, make lists, and read trip reports. But even with that the developers are constantly changing and removing features. That said: Bring back the “nearby trails” features please 🙄This app is super slow even on a new iphone 13 pro with a fast internet connection. The user experience design is really aggravating - mainly that when you're looking around the map and you zoom in to click on a trail marker in order to see a preview of a trail, the trail turns red - great - but you'll need to zoom out to see the whole trail... which automatically deselects the trail you've selected and shows you a different trail based on your new zoom level. It's beyond frustrating and completely idiotic. Especially for an app you pay some 40$ / year for. Who thought that behavior / interaction was a good idea? Its been this way for a long time and I can't believe this has passed through generations of updates and decision makers. PLEASE FIX. Thanks! :) I'll probably switch to another GPS app because I cant take it anymore.I pay for a subscription to AllTrails because the maps are good, the track recording works well and is accurate, and the off-track alert is very effective. What I absolutely hate is the naggy character of this app that requires you to rate the hike, and wants you to write a review. I did not pay for an app to be nagged. AllTrails seems to want to be the Facebook of the outdoors, building a community and all that … stuff. Please just concentrate on making the maps and tracking work great, and make ANY participation in your community aspirations optional. I am not anti-social. I just want to be able to choose my own community, and not be nagged by some app that I paid for.This app used to be the best, so I bought a premium membership. Recently over the last 6 months or so I’ve experienced so many bugs, which has made using the app super frustrating. for example, when selecting a hike on the map, the preview shows a DIFFERENT hike, and sometimes glitches between showing a number of different (wrong) hikes. Another example:  downloading trail no longer works. When I click download, the loading circle pops up and then nothing else happens. I have wifi connection and iPhone space, and even deleted the app and redownloaded it. Issues persisted. I wouldn’t buy the premium again.I was the recent safety support person for someone who has AllTrails Pro. He went for a winter solo hike as he often does in the snowy mountains east of Seattle. It was about 30 min till sundown and I sent a text because his position had quit updating. I know that area has sketchy connectivity to cell but I hadn’t received updates for over three hours. I was forced to call Search & Rescue. He was OK but, forensically, it turns out he had already reached the summit and had already gone back by the last known position on his way down (where cell connection is good). BUT, AllTrails Pro did not re-sync with location reporting where it last had a connection. This was alarming to me and others involved.I use it to find trails and then i download the maps. Then when I get out to the trail with no connection, the app takes minutes to load, because it's trying to reach their servers I presume. Then it tries to start downloading the map, even though I already downloaded them at home. After 5 minutes or more I can finally see something and start walking and if The phone goes off or I accidentally touch the phone to switch apps I have to start the whole thing over. 

It would be dangerous to depend on this app. Have they even tested their product on trails that don't have internet connections?I’ve been a user for years but I’ve given up on AllTrails, switching to another app that focuses more on maps and routing and less on reviews, photos and more social media focused functionality.

I just want to find interesting trails, track my hike, make sure I stay on the route, and get back safely

I grew tired of getting nagged about the same trails each time I launch the app, and nag to rate, leave reviews, and upload photos after use.

Tracking got spoiled too many times to when I forgot to stop it. Competitor apps allow you to fix this problem. And maintain your history more accurately.

All trails does have the largest selection of routes available for use, but this is a very solvable problem with any of the competitor apps.

If AllTrails should ever make it possible to just use the app without being nagged to share experiences so much, I might consider using it againSo we go out to hike a new trail series today - and while I’ve not been out in a month I see the app has changed - everyone is standing around waiting for me to get started so we do, but alas all I can figure out on the run in the sun is how to navigate on a known trail in the app.   Once we left the selected trail and merged on to a connection it went crazy telling me I was off trail. Give me back the old - where it was easy to record and see other trails in the area based upon what you were seeing.      I ended up losing the record of the hike as I needed to logout and save battery.I have the pro version and if you do not have internet connection the app is useless. AllTrails should take note from the REI Hike app. REI lets you download maps for a whole state. 

I went to uses AllTrails pro and remembered to download the individual trails I might go on, I had to do each hike separately, I couldn’t do a state or national park.  But after the hike I couldn’t save it because I was offline. So I couldn’t record another hike until I saved the first one

Save your time and money and just get the REI hiking project app.Not a bad app if you’re just looking for local places for short hikes, specifically in busier areas. It’s more geared towards the social aspect of hiking.

Most hikes I have done do not have cell coverage. Another major flaw, when following directions on how to get to a hike, after arrival it completely dismisses the hike you are planning to do. You need to open the app again and look for your hike again. Another flaw, while recording, if you stop to take pictures or for whatever reason, it stops recording!!! This has happened to me many times and it happened again at today’s hike. Lost my trail. I had to open the app again and look where I was on the trail layers. It was as if you were dropped in a trail 3/4 of the way, but had no recollection of what you have already done. I’m AllTrails Pro subscriber. Deeply regretted.This app has excellent trails and an easy to read layout. I would love it except for 1 major feature which kills it completely for me.  At the end of every hike/bike/run i do… this app forces me to give a star rating to my route, then goes through a series of other screens which ask me to add pictures and names. At the end of my route, i am TIERD and BUZY loading a bunch of gear into my car.i don’t want to stand around at that time playing with my phone.  I just want to end my route and go home not drop everything and  give all trails more fodder for their social media. This app cares  more for social media, than it cares for athletes serious about training.AllTrails maps and content are great but the app itself is super slow and unresponsive (iPhone 12) Often click a link and it just hangs there on the screen, no loading state, just nothing, for 1-3 seconds.

Like others have mentioned, the app is constantly looking for an internet connection, even when all you want to do is access your downloaded maps. I don’t understand why all the content had to load before you can do anything in the app, and if you’ve saved something for offline it should always just be there. 

When you click download map nothing happens. I have to click it 2-3 times over 3 seconds or so before a dialog appears saying do I want to cancel the download. That’s the only way I know it’s actually downloading. They having loading states in the app but it’s so slow they never trigger. 

The app also eats your battery when tracking your progress on a map. My phone can get sucked from full battery to 0 on a longer trail.Update 2023

I still use it for trail discovery, but it still randomly stops recording so I always use strava too. 

Also, it needs cropping functionality. It is incredibly common to get to the end of the trail, start socializing or whatever and forget to stop recording. That screws up all your stats. Your speed will be insane, nobody hikes as fast as a car. Your miles will also be thrown off. And, your only option is to delete the hike. Lame. 

Strava offers cropping. It also offers hike and run planning right in the app. No need to go to a web site. 

—-

I’ve recorded 5 hikes so far and 3 of them stopped recording randomly at about 1/2 mile in. The app is great for doing research, and discovering trails, but it is unreliable and has a fussy interface for recording your hikes. I always use a backup app to make sure it gets recorded.Load times used to be okay, but they’ve just gotten worse with new updates. Even at home on wifi trail reviews and conditions just take ages to load. Likely won’t be staying a pro or plus or whatever subscriber if the devs can’t figure out a way to get their content to load quickly enough. It seems their focus on making things more social is drawing their focus away from making it the best navigation tool for use in the field.I am an avid runner, cyclist and hike. Overall I love outdoors and enjoy running on trails. What I don’t like is why charge a fee to find local trails and most of the time the info are not accurate such would be app crashing once the phone screen is off or the trails doesn’t show connection when trail hopping only shows you’re completely off the map grid. Terrible I won’t recommended and in fact I am looking for a better app to use.The ability to download maps is great but it’s irritating that the app has to re-start every time you leave it and doesn’t go back to the map in use. 

To add to this, there is no easy way to find your “recently accessed” or “downloaded maps” so you have to dig through everything you’ve ever saved to find them.  

Adding a “downloaded maps” filter seems like a no-brainer.  

Also. If you accidentally click on something requiring a data connection, the “something went wrong” message which refuses to go away blocks the entire menu bar at the bottom of the screen.  

Without these annoying interface issues this would be a 5 star app.",0,"Great idea.

It is a 5 star app by far, yet that is not my rating for it. There are a few quirks I have with the UI, but they are not worth mentioning as they are minor and do not effect the app use whatsoever. 
My only real issue, which caused my 4 star rating (which killed me to do so), is the fact that you CANNOT LAUNCH THE APP WITHOUT A CELLULAR OR WIFI CONNECTION!! It is ridiculous, plain and simple. I am a Pro subscriber to AllTrails. I did this solely so I could download trail maps prior to going in case I lost service on the trail. That feature works beautifully. But let’s say you download your map, head out to your trail, arrive and go to open app to use the map that is already saved on your phone. Guess what?? Unless you have service, you can’t open the app! So it’s essentially useless. The last thing I want to do is have to add “open AllTrails prior to leaving home” to my to do list to get ready. 
AllTrails, lets be real for a minute. Hiking, biking, exploring, etc. are all off the grid things! Chances are you won’t have service if you are in a remote location. Fix this issue!! Make an offline version of your app so that paid users who have already downloaded maps can actually use them!
With that said, this is an amazing app that is worthy of 5 stars. It is just failing miserably in one particular area that is critical to its use.I have used AllTrails a lot over the years. MN North Shore Hiking, South Cali hiking, Hawaii hiking, etc. However, just a couple of days ago, I started looking at my profile and noticed that EVERYTHING was public. All of my lists, my activities, which maps I downloaded, just to name a few. So I figured I would go into settings and change all of that, but that only changes the setting on FUTURE additions. So I had to go back and individually change everything to only show to my connections. Oh, and I also had to then make sure that I approved all my connections. The first test of someone requesting a follow was not good either. No notifications when you are in the app or a simple place to go. I had to dig deep. This would almost be a deal breaker for me (Pro user for years), but I decided to just put as little information in it as possible. Including reviewing and tracking trails. What a bummer.

Response to developer:

Just checked and the option is not there on my phone.This app is my go to for all my hiking excursions. It adds in the local weather and if it’s a more used trail, there are updates from local hikers. Accurate in elevation gain and mileage. Downloadable maps.
I give it 4 and not 5 because now they are making it a social app. They added a community space and they tally up you miles which shines like a medallion when someone wants to view your ‘profile’. Wish I could opt out. I have not been on social media and I am not interested in making my hiking life a competition. Kinda upset that even AllTrails is falling to this common pleaser that seems all apps are caving into for more downloads or something. 
It’s updates besides that are magnificent and I appreciate a dedicated team.The app is great. I use it to find new trails & record my hikes. Having a map of your trails is a must for safety purposes. I’m taking one star off for not being able to remove followers. Seriously? So some scam account with an inappropriate name followed me and there’s no way to remove it? What if someone starts stalking you? How does any social platform not have a remove or block followers feature? Ridiculous. And I have the pro account that I pay for. I’ve emailed All Trails & am still waiting for this to be resolved.I have the Pro membership and a lot of the places I hike have a weak signal. I can download all of Yellowstone on Google maps for offline use in less than a minute, even with a poor connection. But a couple mile hike often struggles even with a good WiFi connection. The downloading of the maps needs to be better. Love the app, love the concept. But this needs to be fixed. 

Some trails downloads in seconds. So to me this just says it’s a technical issue.It seems like the search function no longer works well. It will routinely not show results that I know were previously there; it will show semi-related things that I searched previously instead. At first I thought it was about connection, but I’ve since ruled that out.

As a specific example searching “Baker Lake” (Northwest Washington State) used to yield the lake itself, the surrounding trails, trails with “Baker Lake” literally in the title, and now none of that will show up.",1,"Great app with one major flawLove the Information, but….Would have given it 5 stars a year agoCommunity FlawToo dependent on a good signal.Decline in Function",EvoRacer37BossHoss_16dr.squeezie*Elory*NicolayHDShaull315,"{'id': 15142515, 'body': ""Hi there - we're sorry to hear you are having trouble launching the app in low-signal areas.

AllTrails is no exception. It works as expected. But there are a few neat little features in the app that I didn’t know about. Mostly, the RECORD feature. It’s cool as heck and it works great and you can share your hikes to social media if you’re into that garbage, or share with a friend via text message. I got the app to help me locate trailheads. This was years ago, and the internet is a great source for such things. My maps app in my phone locates some by name, which is cool. 
Anyway, if you’re a hiker or mountain biker or whatever and you could use a good trails map, definitely check this one out. I love it anyway.It’s on this app that I re-found my love for hiking, which turned into mountaineering and climbing. It makes finding hikes extremely simple, and I love it. However, people need to know when trails are dangerous. In addition, they should have YDS grading systems for scrambling for more advanced hikes/mountaineering, as some trails require that. The social aspect is great, I think there should be the ability to directly message users due to specific questions others may have about trails or the conditions. Other than that, love alltrails and how it’s grownI used two trail apps in the wilderness this weekend and I generally found AllTrails more useful at making sure I wasn’t heading down an unmarked side trail instead of my intended path. GPS generally updated in a few seconds even deep in the woods and with enough detail that I could query the map less than a hundred feet down the path. Wasn’t sure if maps would be available without downloads at the basic level but I was able to consistently open the default local topo maps with no connection and in airplane mode.I like the app a lot and use it almost exclusively for planning hikes. On the trail I don’t use it very often because it’s too easy to check how far I’ve gone and be disappointed 😋 I guess the biggest problem I have is that in the mountains LTE and 3G connections are almost nonexistent, with 1x & no service being equally common. If there’s a way to preload a map and save it so the only thing the cellular connection is used for is to move your dot, I can’t figure it out. It’s pretty thirsty for juice, too. It’s really a great backup to a paper map, too. Yeah, I’m old-school LOLI discovered the AllTrails app about 2 1/2 years ago. I got into hiking right about the same time I quit drinking and change my diet. I have explored the better part of 100 different trails in my area thanks to this app. I have recorded and documented lots of hikes and I couldn’t of done it without this app. My only complaint with this app is the social media part of it lacks something to be desired. There are lots of other people on this app I’d like to connect with and so far I can’t do so.

This has nothing to do with the All Trails app, and there’s nothing AllTrails can do to fix this issue.  It has to do with the strength of the GPS receiver in your phone.  If the GPS signal is lost because of cloud cover or whatever, AllTrails will stop recording your route because it cannot locate you while your GPS receiver is unable to connect with the GPS in orbit around Earth.  Sometimes it doesn’t matter how good your GPS receiver is, and the signal connection will still be lost.  If your phone is constantly losing GPS connection, either your phone’s receiver is low quality, the weather is impeding the connection, or you’re simply in a location where a GPS receiver is going to constantly drop connection no matter how good your receiver is.  I hope this helps.Its funny how all the five star reviews were from a year or longer? This use to be the best app! Loved it. I have the pro version. And have recommended this to everyone. But since update after update. The app no longer works like it used to. If you have a IOS don’t bother recording your routes it will not verify you. It has stopped on its own while recording. I have emailed AllTrails but sadly nothing has happened except a email back that they are working on it. They have added more  social features   But I think its more important to have the routes working correctly so you don’t get lost and have your trails verified as you worked so hard to complete them then to connect with a friend. I know I know just email AllTrails they will respond…I keep having issues with my location. It has my location as a completely different state and I keep getting an error message saying I need to have a data connection to change it, which I do AND I’m on Wi-Fi as well. Furthermore I’m trying to search for a very specific trail by name and I cannot find it on here. I’m wondering if it has something to do with my location..? I’ve searched by town, state and trail name. Other than the issues I’m having today I have gotten a lot of use out of this app. I have found many interesting trails near my house that I didn’t even know existed.I love this app and am happy to shell out for the subscription to download maps and live navigate on trails.

However, I often forget to stop a hike when complete and the app adds my drive back home or wherever else I go to my activity, with no way to edit it. I really really wish there was a way to edit the activity to only include the trail sections or edit some other way (by time?)

I love hiking and would probably post many of my activities on social media if not for having 4 hour hikes of ~50 miles that include my trip back. Please fix this!I’ve had this app for a while now with no issues, since 2 days I’ve seeing no internet error even I am connected to the internet.

Trying to google hiking trails only brings up 2 or 3 around my city that are usually overcrowded and not that great, but this app has over 100 listed in my little town. It has everything that I could ask for and more—filters to search certain trails (bike route, allows dogs, waterfall/rivers, etc), difficulty ratings, weather forecast, reviews, photos, trail length, personal stats, and more. Some of these trails are in the middle of nowhere and you can pull up directions to drive to the start. It tracks your time, elevation gain, miles, and your route. You can save your favorite trails, and the ones that you have completed will show up on your profile. I haven’t been hiking a whole lot in the past, but now I have been going several times a week and I still have a lot of trails saved that I want to try! It’s like a social media app for hikers. If you like to hike (or if you think you want to start), I would recommend downloading this app. It exceeds my expectations and I have never been so motivated to go out and explore!This is a great little app.  I’m pretty new to hiking, but this app has encouraged me to try different trails that I’d previously steer clear of for sheer lack of knowledge and fear of getting lost.  In this sense, it is a game-changer for me.  Haven’t used the social platform because it seems a little lacking.  So the connectivity is challenging.  For instance, it would be nice if people could respond to reviews, but the only way to do that is to write a review yourself.  Would be nice to be able to comment on pics too.  I realize it’s primarily for tracking and mapping—and in this sense I couldn’t ask for anything more.  But the tinkering it does with social connection makes me feel like it could be much more than it is—or why even hint at it and make it difficult to connect?  I guess what I would like to see is a kind of Waze system where you can see where other hikers are live and what the encounter.  Could be helpful if someone gets hurt or lost if the connectivity was more advanced.First off, need to say i love this app and use it as a hiking bible!! Some recommendations I have for the developers:

Under reviews, show a user’s reputation score next to their name. It would be helpful to know if the person saying this trail is “soooo hard” is a complete noob to hiking or someone whose been on hundreds of trails, just for a frame of reference. Why have the reputation score if it isn’t displayed next to the usernames in the comments and reviews?

Also, while reading about the app it mentions you can upload edits to trails and routes. I can’t figure out how to do this on the app? There are many trails that the All Trails trail takes u into an unsafe area, and I would like to edit that for future users. I’ve noticed the desktop has some features the mobile app doesn’t.... such as making “lists” and creating new trails. 

Next, in addition to easy medium and hard.... add a safety ranking! Here on Oahu there are easy hikes that are super treacherous and then super hard hikes that are on huge pieces of land with nowhere to fall or get lost. For somewhere like Hawai’i this feature is very necessary. 

Finally, think there should be a DM (direct message) feature to make the app a bit more social! Or at least link to Instagram. 

I was sad that Sacred Falls was removed from the app. While it is an illegal hike, those choosing to do it could need it as a lifeline.... better safe than sorryI seriously love this app. It’s the best for anything from planning multi-day backpacking trips to spontaneous trail runs. 

One update I would LOVE to see would be the option to tag other AllTrails users in my hikes! It would be so fun for the social aspect—having a log of who went with you where. It would also be sweet if when you were tagged you had the option to add your friend’s recorded stats. Sometimes you forget to hit record or resume, so how awesome would it be to have a backup recording from your friend so no trail goes unlogged?

Also... it wouldn't hurt to have a different cycle of photos to show up on the loading screen. Anyone else get a kick out of the current picture of a girl that looks like she’s headed to a dainty sorority picnic rather than a hike in the mountains...? 😂This app allows me the have a GPS on my phone overlaid on the topo lines, showing the route others have taken and my present location.  It also shows the elevation profile. Plus it works without an internet or phone connection.  

There’s even a rangefinder that shows the “crow fly” distance to any point you chose on the map. 

There is a database of 50k plus hikes to chose from and this can be filtered in various ways. You can save any of these to your “favorites” list and arrange them in any order you like. 

And I can take photos and track my completed hikes along with basic stats.  And I get a map showing all my completed and planned hikes

I just recently discovered I can also organize the hikes I want to do by making a “list”.  This feature allows you to geographically (or any other feature) organize you hikes.  For example I’ve created a list of hikes along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  This allows me to quickly separate those hikes from Colorado (for example)I use this app everyday, AllTrails has literally changed my life . I discovered it during the start of COVID and it has guided me to so many wonderful trails that few people know exist. I was able to get out and social distance and exercise.  I love using the map to find the trailhead and stay on the trail.  And there are reviews you can read to see what kind of shape a trail is in befire you start it.  Thank you AllTrails.I’ve purchased this app for several years.  It’s totally worth it just for the downloadable maps especially when you are out of reach of cellular.  I use it when I travel for work and want to find a hike nearby.  The ability to attach pictures and save creates a great memory book, and if you are so inclined can post to social media. Highly recommendedI hardly ever leave reviews… but this app is just so great that I couldn’t help but express gratitude. It’s truly an incredible resource. And now that they’ve added the social element where you can show and share your hikes… It’s even better. This is one of my favorite apps of all time. I sound like a fake review right now probably but I’m not. If you like hiking, then you need this.I love this App for biking where I live.  It tells me,  not only where I’ve been, distance wise, but gives your elevation changes, too, based on topographicals.  It’s pretty cool for the Free feature.

I think the best part is that there’s no external connection needed.  It tracks you even in dead data zones.  I may, eventually check out premium, but the free version works great for what I need it for.I’ve been using this app for over a year! Since I moved to an area that isn’t flat and it has helped soooo much with following trails and no it doesn’t work if you are opening a map without connection! Buttt if you already had it open before you loose connection then you will be able to see the blue dot and where you are on the trail! Fabulous!I use All Trails every chance I get. 
The information is detailed and useful. The maps are excellent, especially in gauging where I am and which way I need to go. 
Last week one showed me way off the trail when I thought I was on it. 
You can download the trail map for times when you internet connection is gone, which is quite often - thankfully!!This is the best $30 per year I spend anywhere in my life! For anybody that likes to get outside I simply don’t understand how you could not have this app. Driving directions. Weather conditions. Downloadable trail maps for use without cell connections. Use your photos. Honest reviews. Really is fantastic!I love how easy-to-use this platform is! Instead of scrolling on social media, im scrolling different hikes nearby and planing for my next adventure. As someone with the worse sense of direction, the satellite trail map download function gives me a sense of security when I’m hiking. The subscription is worth every penny for me!Super easy to use to find new hikes and the ability to download maps so you have them offline is really useful. Often there isn’t a signal so if you need a  phone connection  for an app you are screwed. I’ve been 100% happy with this app & have a ton of hikes I want to try. The reviews are super helpful.Honestly... This is a hikers social media ha. I spend hours looking for hikes - big and small- and all the the reviews from hikers are so useful for ditections, snow, bugs, parking, intensity, unique stops along my the way. Love that you can see people's thoughts that hiked it just yesterday. Updates well. I'd recommend this 100%. So easy to use and makes hiking available for many. Thank you All Trails!This is a great app.  Love that it works off line. Love the elevations so you can plan the day/rests on the trail. Love that you can mark points among the trail, but wish you could add pics and text after the fact. I don't like to stop on the trail to do the social media part - I’d like to do that after we are finished and sitting around with our shoes off reminiscing about the day over a drink!I purchased the PRO version yesterday and used it on a trail at Red Rocks. I really love all the features. From planning the trip to helping you getting there, to recording the whole adventure and keeping wonderful memories that you can share with friends, family and social media. What an amazing App! It will become a lifetime feature of my life in Colorado.Whether you’re an expert mountaineer, or just going for a casual walk for the views, this app has everything. Between the personal reviews by fellow hikers, seasonal photos of each trail, and descriptive instructions about the trailheads, I use this app wherever I’m traveling to find the best hikes in the area. It’s became more popular then any other social media app I have in my phone!It’s quite an amazing app! It works even without connection. Even if you don’t download and pay for the premium features, there’s still all the necessary features that you need! Me and my boyfriend recently used it on a hike and it was so cool to see where we’ve been and our elevation at certain points! 5/5 recommend it!This is so helpful! Here we are experiencing a pandemic and social distancing but wanting to be outside as much as possible. We have already uncovered two amazing trails both within a 10 min drive. We really enjoyed exploring these incredible spots that where here all this time but took a pandemic for me to uncover.This app is quite possibly my all time favorite app! I love hiking and this app is the best app for it. I love how it shows trails near me, gives their difficult level, and provides pictures and reviews. I’ve made a list of all the trails I want to do and it’s really helping me get through this “social-distancing” time!",0,"Above and beyondUseful and AccurateLove this app for hiking!

The plus is the map on the watch is useful. Unfortunately, UI on watch is kind of a mess (hard to pause and resume hiking tracking on the watch, you seem to need to pull out your phone to do it reliably). Also, every time you lower your wrist and then check your watch, it goes back to the main screen instead of the screen you selected (like the map). Finally, the dealbreaker was that it is terrible at measuring steps or using GPS to track distance. My computed pace was hilariously wrong (jumped from 20m to 2 hours per mile) and elevation gained was 3x greater than my actual gain. It’s a shame this app is so buggy on the basic features that would make it useful.Over I like the app but there are several major issues. 1. In the last couple updates, the contrast in the UI makes many pages unusable - the actual and planned elevation are unreadable in the sun. Please hire a UX person and test for WCAG compliance. Dark grey text on black background looks cool but doesn’t work. 2. Search for parks and trails is awful. Start entering a park name and the Ap suggests it - good. But results first show a half dozen OTHER parks- the one suggested is in the second or third screen of results. Most results don’t have the keywords anywhere in the name or description. Just prioritize matches in the name. 3. Needs to auto -stop tracking when you forget to turn it off. Yeah I know I’m supposed to do that but if I selected Hiking and am going 30mph, I’m probably not hiking anymore.I pay for a subscription to AllTrails because the maps are good, the track recording works well and is accurate, and the off-track alert is very effective. What I absolutely hate is the naggy character of this app that requires you to rate the hike, and wants you to write a review. I did not pay for an app to be nagged. AllTrails seems to want to be the Facebook of the outdoors, building a community and all that … stuff. Please just concentrate on making the maps and tracking work great, and make ANY participation in your community aspirations optional. I am not anti-social. I just want to be able to choose my own community, and not be nagged by some app that I paid for.This app is good as far as tracking your progress on a hike. It shows your blue dot if you venture off the path by accident, and can help you get back on the trail. However, their system of rating trails is impossible to figure out and I’ve searched and searched for how they rate something easy vs moderate vs hard. Two out of town friends ended up attempting a 14er because it was listed as “moderate”. An 8 mile hike with 4000 elevation gain is moderate, so what is hard? I’ve done “moderate” hikes of 5 miles with 900 elevation gain, vs hikes of 4 miles with 1500 elevation gain which were basically straight up and a lot more difficult, yet still listed as moderate. They need an explanation guide of how they rate the trails so you know what you’re getting into.Pro member of this app.  It’s not that great. For one thing taking photos can kill the app and ruin your tracking.  AllTrails suggests taking photos through their app, but then doesn’t allow Panoramas.  Gee thanks.  

AllTrails is best for use at home on a desktop computer to plan your hikes.  Trying to actually hike with it on multiple occasions has been more hassle than beneficial.  The Apple Watch app is absolutely atrocious; it’s so bad I don’t even use it and instead track my hikes with other apps that have way better watch companions.  

I won’t be renewing my Pro subscription after the year is over.I’ve been a user for years but I’ve given up on AllTrails, switching to another app that focuses more on maps and routing and less on reviews, photos and more social media focused functionality.

I just want to find interesting trails, track my hike, make sure I stay on the route, and get back safely

I grew tired of getting nagged about the same trails each time I launch the app, and nag to rate, leave reviews, and upload photos after use.

Tracking got spoiled too many times to when I forgot to stop it. Competitor apps allow you to fix this problem. And maintain your history more accurately.

All trails does have the largest selection of routes available for use, but this is a very solvable problem with any of the competitor apps.

If AllTrails should ever make it possible to just use the app without being nagged to share experiences so much, I might consider using it againStops tracking location if another app is opened while recording.  Not opening on Apple Watch even when open on phone. (seems fixed with update).  Range finder was a feature that I used frequently.  Now it is gone.  Annoyed that a feature that I frequently used was eliminated.  I have premium version.  Even though I download maps before going into a low signal area, for offline use, the maps no longer open. Hoping that an update will fix this.Not a bad app if you’re just looking for local places for short hikes, specifically in busier areas. It’s more geared towards the social aspect of hiking. That being said, if you’re a backpacker or serious hiker you’ll want something like GAIA or Avenza which offer a lot more mapping/GPS/offline options as well as more detailed tracking. After switching to GAIA I’ll never use AllTrails again for anything other than seeing how busy a given trail is.This app has some super annoying bugs. It will quit tracking with no notifications if you check another app or send a text while using it. It also forces you to go through three steps to just turn it on to track your route. When you’re done, it forces you to rate your route and asks you to take a photo and other stupid stuff before you can quit the app. The Gaia app is much better",1,"Inaccurate elevation gained, poor Apple Watch supportDisappointingAllTrails is a Real NagNo consistencyIt’s okay, but needs tons of improvement.Too much focus on social media functionalityNot as reliable as it used to beHiking App for Beginners/Older folksGaia is better",BBrinckmacsfast69wudwkr2StylishnickiRaymond FortnightrtphokieClimbBlingJblack417Whmscll,"{'id': 27768912, 'body': 'Hi there - thanks so much for the feedback.

Easy to use, helpful to find new trails, pretty great tracking and mapping. The only complaint I have, and it is a deal breaker for me, the save and clear buttons are right next to the record button. When you pause, and then go to start again there is a chance you’ll end your current ride, walk, etc. Terrible placement for those. It is common we will ride, and at some point pause for water, session, snack, and then the save button is accidentally hit or even sweat falling on the phone has cleared a current ride. It’s insanely frustrating when you want the recorded 10-15 mile path for reference or whatever and it is cleared from accidentally hitting save. I feel like that is a really terrible issue to even have to worry about. Even having a “You sure?” after selecting save would be great; then you could back out of it. Started looking into other apps to use and found I really enjoy Strava. Great community with that app. I recommend checking it out and using it.

The clear button does have a “You sure?”, but save doesn’t. I like that someone reached out to me about the issue, and again, the app is great overall. Although I responded, there was never a response from them.I love this App when it works. In the last year I have logged close to 600 miles through it. However, there would be more if it didn’t unexpectedly crash. Thankfully it “Saves you place” for you so if you catch that it’s not tracking you, you can restart. 

Crashes during hikes most often happen when I take photographs. Unfortunately, that is a huge part of why I walk so many miles. So that is a problem. It has gotten to the point where sometimes I choose not to take pictures because I don’t want the app to crash. 

That also means that instead of being present in the moment while I walk, I am worrying about an app that should run silently and reliably in the background. 

Finally, downloading maps, which is critical for any off grid hikes, exacerbates the crashing. To the point that when I let the app download the map from last night’s hike, I could no longer keep it open long enough to see my stats. The only solution when the app repeatedly crashes on launch is to delete the app and its data from my phone. Then reload it and sign into my Pro account. 

The fact that despite all of these shortcomings, frustrations, and bugs, I still use it for every hike, should indicate how potentially great this app could and should be.Dislikes:
1. Can’t set a default activity type. Every time I save a trail  I have to remember to change the activity from hiking to off road. I am usually tired and want to head straight home after a ride and want save the trail quickly.
2. Too many acknowledgements when taking a photo. Should take you to the photo app immediately. Should not ask you if you want to take a photo after you select photo.
3. Way, way too slow at startup. I usually start it up and find something else too do when I open the app. 
4. Wish directions feature would provide an alternate trail starting point when available. Entering a trail at original starting point can add a ridiculous amount travel time getting to the trail.
5. Zooming function is slow, recenter function is inconsistent, and tracking current drive is inconsistent. Sometimes the app doesn’t follow my drive after I recenter. Sometimes recenter retains the last zoom setting and sometimes it doesn’t.

Likes:
1. Easy too use for planning trips 
2. Downloadable maps. A must for any app like this.
3. A good variety of downloadable maps.
4. I like being able to add waypoints in case I want to return to a trail in the future.I’ve used AllTrails for 6 year and logged over 1200 miles. The last two weeks my downloaded maps are no longer working. Today I drove 45 minutes down a dirt road to get to a hike you needed a map just to start. To my surprise, my downloaded map is just green. No directions for anything. Happened in glacier national park two weeks ago.  Had to drive 45 minutes back into town to get cell reception, start my tracking, then drive back just so I had a clue what direction to go. Very disappointed with all the new updates and how poorly the app has been the last year. Going to start trying other apps to see if they are more reliable. 

Thanks for many good years.Latest upgrade took away the ability to edit the order my to-do list. Very frustrating. Now you can only order it in alphabetical or order added. We occasionally get sent on wild goose chases searching for trails that don’t actually exist. It will be interesting to see what they do with the new suggested trail edit function (although I’m not sure how you describe in words which trail in a system is not actually there). I wish there was a live tracking function for mutual friends, so we could actively monitor each other as we separately explore the same trail system. On the whole the app is really good, but the details need work.The app is pretty good but has some major flaws.

1. The pause/finish buttons are located at the bottom. For newer iPhones without the no home button, you need to swipe up to minimize the app. It’s a major UI design flaw. I can’t believe it hasn’t been corrected. That can lead to unplanned pauses/finishes which can (a) pause tracking and therefore stop collecting data, or (b) finish the hike and there’s no back button. 

2. The app can also just stop tracking. I’ll lock the phone and put in my pocket only to find it stopped collecting data some time ago. I need to constantly check to see if it’s still tracking . It cause me anxiety which is not what I’m looking for when I go outdoors.

3. You can go into your profile on a PC and, through a complex process, correct the route but you then lose your hiking time and pacing data. Pick your poison. 

4. This is a know issue with many complaints. They would rather make the app look pretty than fix core issues. 

Going to give Garmin and/or Gaia a chance.I use all trails to find hikes, and it is an amazing resource. It makes finding hikes really convenient with its interface. However the distances are always wrong by at least a few miles which is frustrating. 

My 14 mile hike will actually be 16.5 miles, and that’s really frustrating. These mileage is not trustworthy and makes all trails an unreliable resource for anything outside of finding a trail head. Even tracking a hike the distance measurements and elevation will not be accurate. Sometimes it’s so inaccurate that it will impact your ability to make a plan. 

For more accurate route planning, distances, elevation and logistics planning use Gaia GPS.AllTrails maps and content are great but the app itself is super slow and unresponsive (iPhone 12) Often click a link and it just hangs there on the screen, no loading state, just nothing, for 1-3 seconds.

Like others have mentioned, the app is constantly looking for an internet connection, even when all you want to do is access your downloaded maps. I don’t understand why all the content had to load before you can do anything in the app, and if you’ve saved something for offline it should always just be there. 

When you click download map nothing happens. I have to click it 2-3 times over 3 seconds or so before a dialog appears saying do I want to cancel the download. That’s the only way I know it’s actually downloading. They having loading states in the app but it’s so slow they never trigger. 

The app also eats your battery when tracking your progress on a map. My phone can get sucked from full battery to 0 on a longer trail.I’m at a national park and I understand why they want you to pay to subscribe but this feature to see hikes within a certain radius but it feels like a very important feature to leave to the paid only version. I’m looking up hikes on the app and then when I go to see how far away it is - it’s pulling up things 2-3 hour drives away when there are plenty of hikes within 10 minutes. Now I’m looking up hikes on google then back tracking them to all trails. Other than that the app is solidJust don’t get used to the style. As all apps do, this app changes overtime, often for the worse. One day it will update and the “explore” button shall become hidden behind some menu that makes no sense. 
One day it’ll update and your tracking wont work as well as it did prior to the update, on the same trails you’ve been on too! 

Overall, it’s decent at finding trails depending on where you live. Be sure to cross reference local maps to ensure you are on public property, the correct trail, ect.It’s not verifying trails as completed anymore and even when it works it doesn’t do so as quickly. It’s been weeks since I completed 2 trails and it still won’t verify it. Last time it did it updated the next day. Now it just says complete. In the past it updated it in less than a minute. I take pride in being verified. Fix it alltrails. Also bring back that point system that reminded me of Gamerscore points on Xbox. For example I had 48,000 or so now it doesn’t show that.Didn’t work! Obviously because I was hiking, my phone lost reception even though the app was tracking my location live along the trail. I thought I loaded 10 photos while on different parts of the trail. Then I wrote a thorough review of the trail. 

After submitting the review, I got an error saying that the feature isn’t available offline...well I already wrote the review. You should have warned me before I wrote it and before I spent time taking photos along the trail :( :( :(The app for the phone is great. Maps are accurate and the ability to download them is very useful. However, the watch support for this is just dumb. It just allows for recordings. I would change this to a 5/5 if I could pull the map up on my watch in addition to tracking miles, elevation climbed, calories burned and time. The point of watch support is to remove the need for pulling the phone out of the backpack.I use to love this app but it’s been getting way worse with its performance and bugs. The worst is that is won’t load anything when I don’t have any service sometimes, like my downloaded maps. Which defeats the purpose of this app. 

There’s also constant other bugs popping up, like right now my download list is showing only one trail map but repeated the amount of other maps I should have. 

I’ve been a pro member for 3 years, but if this app doesn’t get better before my membership expires, I’m switching to something else.

This use to be helpful for finding and tracking hike activity, but it’s just gotten increasingly more frustrating to use.AllTrails worked for a few months and then I started to notice huge inaccuracies in their calculations. When I emailed customer service there seemed to be a lack of interest in troubleshooting problems; their emailed explanations never addressed the issue presented. For keeping at less a good estimate of and tracking my distance, calorie burn, progress, etc., I was not satisfied. I found the app to be inconsistent.The old scoring system was so fun. I would compete with friends and family on who can have the best score & get out for the most walks. Unfortunately it was removed in April 2021.. since then, most the people I did that with are no longer using the app. They’ve moved to Strava instead... kind of sad to be doing this alone, but here we are",1,"Will be looking for another app...Wish it didn’t crashConsidering discontinuing my subscriptionWas great at one point, but not now.On the whole very good, but overlooked the details…Don’t buy if you really care about dataGreat resource but lacks accurate distancesGreat Content Unreapinsive AppGreat app but distance away for pro?Great app overallNot verifying as completed!!!Do not use while offline!Watch support is pointlessExtremely buggyInaccurate calculations.Bring back the score!",MunkMunkPoorsnyderrivfamDandman311Mothmom12Significant Design Flawf0ck_thisawfulawful123all of the names are goneFluffydaFluffLikeOMGiTzDavidSuzy NYCRgermainJamiePilBlkQueenBlkPottedStone,"{'id': 19049112, 'body': ""Hi there - thanks for the feedback and sorry to hear that you think the recorder button is horrible.

I use this app every single weekend to make 1-3 maps for my weekend trips without fail and this app is crucial and I really do love it so much. Here is my only complaint.. in order to keep my true walking pace (excluding breaks) I will pause my activity . If I forget to “resume activity” then the distance I hike until I realize that I did not press “resume” is essentially lost. I did not teleport 3 miles down the trail.. there HAS to be a way to resolve this . This is a simple human error and I cannot be the only one who is frustrated by this. When that happens, the entire distance tracking is thrown off and there is a large gap on the map as well as miles completed. There needs to be an auto fill that bases your pace on the current time and since the time activity was paused when it notices a gap on the trail. It just needs to be filled in because the gps locates and pinpoints you on the section of the trail that you are on but assumes you did not walk there.. please find a way to solve this.I have used AllTrails a lot over the years. MN North Shore Hiking, South Cali hiking, Hawaii hiking, etc. However, just a couple of days ago, I started looking at my profile and noticed that EVERYTHING was public. All of my lists, my activities, which maps I downloaded, just to name a few. So I figured I would go into settings and change all of that, but that only changes the setting on FUTURE additions. So I had to go back and individually change everything to only show to my connections. Oh, and I also had to then make sure that I approved all my connections. The first test of someone requesting a follow was not good either. No notifications when you are in the app or a simple place to go. I had to dig deep. This would almost be a deal breaker for me (Pro user for years), but I decided to just put as little information in it as possible. Including reviewing and tracking trails. What a bummer.

Response to developer:

Just checked and the option is not there on my phone.Ever since you updated the app, it’s a nightmare. Tells me I have done double the elevation gain I’ve done. Stops tracking me when I exit the app to check a text or my timer. Totally ruined my Grand Canyon hike by separating into 10 separate completed small hikes, instead of tracking my complete hike including offshoots off the main trail (which it used to do well). 

It’s terrible. I hate it. I’ve recommended it to hundreds of people and cannot anymore. PLEASE UNDO YOUR HORRIBLE UPDATES! And seriously how dare you try and force me to rate, name, add photos to and comment on every single walk I ever take. That’s insane. I hike some trails 4 times a week. Why would I do that? Then it freezes up when I try and exit the forced commenting and I have no choice. 

HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. Upgrade. Writing this at a summit where I’ve once again lost my whole hike because the app stopped tracking when I got a text message. WTaF?Generally I love this app on my iphone. It helps me pick hiking trails and I love being able to download maps. The routes are always super accurate. The new trail preview feature is pretty cool. 

I do have an issue with trying to record hikes using the app. I tried a couple of times to use the tracking feature with my apple watch. It's cool that you can see a little map on your watch.  However, on long hikes my battery on both my watch and my iphone get totally drained. I don't know if there's a fix for this, but it was really frustrating to run out of power at the halfway point. Luckily my partner still had a functioning phone or I would have been very worried.This app is fine, I would not consider it the game changer others are. Many of the trails you can find just as easily with a quick google search. The gps feature is nice on complex trails, and if you are into tracking your hikes. I just don’t utilize that many of the features because I like to not use technology when hiking when possible, as it is my escape from screen time. Also the app shuts down randomly and frequently on me while searching for trails on an IPhone SE.I Love AllTrails and would generally give it a 5 except 1 thing I really would love to see…there’s no tracking for skating 😭. The app has a lot of different tracking options but nothing for skating/blading. I track my skating under the “walking” category but I’d love to one day differentiate between skating and we could see the different category statisticsRecently the app has been really bad with tracking a hike properly. My Apple Watch tracked my hike today at 4.5 miles, and the AllTrails app tracked 2.9 miles, which I know is way under what the hike was. Otherwise, I love using this app while hiking. Colorado trails always have so many splits, so it’s nice being able to know exactly where I am going and not get lost.I downloaded the All Trails App at the recommendation of the majority of people I’ve reached out to while looking for a good hiking app. While it appears to be a great app for charting and tracking a trail that you, or another user, has hiked, there doesn’t appear to be an option for dropping waypoints and planning for a hike that you haven’t yet hiked...

When it comes to finding a place to hike, reading reviews, and planning a trip, I love it. But it also feels like it’s trying to be a fitness log, and it falls short there. If I’m logging a hike/bike/run, I want to know fitness stats beyond what is available. At a minimum, heart rate, but Strava and others provide much more. So I end up planning my activity on AllTrails, tracking it on my Apple Watch, sync to Strava, download the GPX, then upload that GPX to AllTrails. Some native integration with Apple Health to import workouts or Strava would be great.I use this app near-religiously to find nearby trails when I'm traveling, plan longer trips, and tracking down the perfect trail when friends and I decide to hit the backcountry. That being said, this is an awesome app with a lot of data but it could use just a bit more.

There are a couple improvements I would love to suggest:
-Ability to share entire lists with others/maybe even collaborate with other members
-Easier method to add trails that don't already exist in your database
-More stability and consistency in performance. Frustrating when my offline map crashes repeatedly and I'm trying to find my route
- An iPad app. Please!!!

Highly recommend this app! Especially as improvements are continually rolled out. :-)This has been my go to app for tracking my Hikes. Two improvements would make this five stars 1. Voice Feedback similar to Under Armour’s Map My Hike. 2. Better trail fetal similar to REI’s app Hiking Project - I have ran into trails where Hiking Project has all the trail names on the map but All Trails did not this would be very helpful. If you could add these two updates this would be my only go to Hiking app.The app works well. Never has issues tracking me. I like you can “record” your hike and save it. The only thing I wish I could do was rename a hike after it’s saved. Once you save it, you can’t add a name after the fact. Seems like a simple thing to add support for.

Hiding it in the “...” was worse, didn’t know it was there and my history is now not accurate, and now I have to make up a name for each recording on the fly.  Waste of time.  Please put check-in back where it belongs, it’s a critical feature, and right map loads with the name of the trail on the saved history. 
I also agree with the other user about trail hopping.  In New England many trails connect but are listed separately.  If you are no longer on the same one you started it appears you are just going rogue on the map.  How about auto loading the newly entered trail?
Also being able to edit history would be helpful. There’s been a couple times where I started driving home and forgot to hit pause and save.  And why the “pause” button when the trail is complete?  It’s a weird way to “finish” or “end hike”. 
Big issue with crashing during use lately.  Thought I was recording and it had crashed once phone was put away.  If I didn’t stop to take a pic early i would have gone pretty far without noticing. Stinks for tracking distance 😐. Overall I do love and use and recommend this app almost daily to find trails and track my history. Can’t live without it but its been acting weird lately.I am a fan of Alltrails app for several years ago. It works wonderfully during my hikes/walks around town and was super helpful  guiding me and my friends on the trails during a Tour de Mont Blanc trip three years ago.

I found one usability issue in the latest version (13.0.2). I use it mostly on daily walks, and it used to feature the tracking function with a big “record” button at the bottom of the display. One click and it started recording my route. This is the feature I use most frequently. In this new version, at first I could not find the record button. Then I figured out that I now have to press 4 clicks to start recording. For a function that (I suspect) many users use frequently this is a terrible UI design. I hope the developers will update the interface to bring back the big start/record button.

Thanks!We got there at 8:40. The permit, permit site, and the discussions and video for the hike did not tell us the park would close up at 8:30 am due to volume and not open again until noon. You pay them for a permit but you cannot get in. To bad for you. A little kindness would have been good. We were 4 cars behind the ranger car shutting it down. Park opens at 8. Had to try back 3 times to finally get in at noon. We also bumped into some grumpy people coming out of the trail loop the way most go in. They got lost repeatedly and gave up. This is our second time. We downloaded the map on all trails and set it to start tracking at the beginning. Small arrows painted in a couple places on rocks plus all trails works great.We noticed after the Apr 21 upgrade the app doesn’t track my hikes consistently eg it quit tracking after approximately a mile.  We had to restart the app.  This never happened with earlier versions.  Taking photos should take 2 clicks vs 5. So on a hike you waste too much time clicking vs hiking and grabbing a quick picture.  IMHO, the Apr 21 update made the process worse by relocating access to the camera while adding another click.The one feature that I love about this app is that it will track your walk/hike while running in the back ground. I have tried several other apps to track my distance. All the others stoped tracking as soon as the screen went dark.",0,Few issues lately. Oct 2018Great app for big trips and everyday use!

It is by far the best GPS tracking app I can find. The maps are detailed and accurate and the descriptions and directions are excellent. Over the years some great upgrades have been made, some of my favorites include being able to download tracks for offline use, marking distance and elevation along a specific track, and being able to create a map by selecting certain trails. 

There are still some frustrating faults with this app, however. For example, in order to record and keep a GPS recording a track a hike has to be part of an existing trail which can get annoying when I do infrequent or bushwhacking hikes. Having an option to keep tracks privately would be very helpful.

One upgrade I would love to see is the ability to edit or add to a track after I finish. Many times in the past I have forgotten to end a track and drove away, the result was an inaccurate GPS track. Also as the app currently is I can’t track multi-day trips, I can pause a track when I stop for lunch, but if I stop for the night my progress disappears. I would like to be able to add to a completed or paused track to be able to record multiple day trips.I’ve had all trails pro for over a year and planned several hikes on it and tracked them. I have not found any other app with as many trails or as complete. I absolutely love the ability to download various maps prior to my trips because they are usually in areas without cell service. No where else has all the types in one place or as easy to find. The tracking on the downloaded maps has saved me and my son’s Boy Scout troop miles in areas where it gets more difficult to stay on trail. In addition to hiking (day and multi day) I like to take my truck out on trails and the reviews here have been great on helping to decide where to go .....and not.

All that great stuff said there are a couple things I’d like to see. First would be the ability to plan hikes on my IPad or phone. On the same vein the ability to see and update my account on iPad and phone. 
The biggest things I would like to see is the location of springs/ water sources with icons maybe 2 icons 1 for drinkable and one for filtering and maybe something to indicate if it’s conditions depending or always there. Also an icon for camp site locations. These would make planning longer multi day hikes easier.This is a great little app.  I’m pretty new to hiking, but this app has encouraged me to try different trails that I’d previously steer clear of for sheer lack of knowledge and fear of getting lost.  In this sense, it is a game-changer for me.  Haven’t used the social platform because it seems a little lacking.  So the connectivity is challenging.  For instance, it would be nice if people could respond to reviews, but the only way to do that is to write a review yourself.  Would be nice to be able to comment on pics too.  I realize it’s primarily for tracking and mapping—and in this sense I couldn’t ask for anything more.  But the tinkering it does with social connection makes me feel like it could be much more than it is—or why even hint at it and make it difficult to connect?  I guess what I would like to see is a kind of Waze system where you can see where other hikers are live and what the encounter.  Could be helpful if someone gets hurt or lost if the connectivity was more advanced.First off, need to say i love this app and use it as a hiking bible!! Some recommendations I have for the developers:

Under reviews, show a user’s reputation score next to their name. It would be helpful to know if the person saying this trail is “soooo hard” is a complete noob to hiking or someone whose been on hundreds of trails, just for a frame of reference. Why have the reputation score if it isn’t displayed next to the usernames in the comments and reviews?

Also, while reading about the app it mentions you can upload edits to trails and routes. I can’t figure out how to do this on the app? There are many trails that the All Trails trail takes u into an unsafe area, and I would like to edit that for future users. I’ve noticed the desktop has some features the mobile app doesn’t.... such as making “lists” and creating new trails. 

Next, in addition to easy medium and hard.... add a safety ranking! Here on Oahu there are easy hikes that are super treacherous and then super hard hikes that are on huge pieces of land with nowhere to fall or get lost. For somewhere like Hawai’i this feature is very necessary. 

Finally, think there should be a DM (direct message) feature to make the app a bit more social! Or at least link to Instagram. 

I was sad that Sacred Falls was removed from the app. While it is an illegal hike, those choosing to do it could need it as a lifeline.... better safe than sorryFirst, the “Pro” version of this is priced just right.

Second, I primarily use it for mountain biking—it is a MUCH cleaner view than Trail Forks or MTB Project, so using it while riding an unfamiliar trail is like having Google Maps (you can download the data for your maps/trail before you head out, so you don’t need cell coverage).  Strava also has a clean look, but (A) not as detailed as far as trail names go and (B) your must have cellular coverage to access the map (beyond a decent radius from where you last had coverage).

With Pro, you can create your own very detailed maps (with great tools), and print/share them—great for letting someone else know EXACTLY where you will be riding in case you don’t come back!  You can also navigate off those maps, and the app will audibly alert you if you become “Off Trail.”

The only “downside” to AllTrails is that those other apps have a TREMENDOUS amount of biking-specific info, so they are much better for planning your trip.  But, AllTrails is the one I actually use on the trail (although I have Strava running in the background to capture my track and stats as a backup, and also to share (bigger biking community).

The latest version really polished the already good graphics, especially the elevation tracking.I’ve always wanted to get in to hiking and want to eventually hike the AT so when the Covid lockdown started I decided to finally begin hiking. I downloaded the app and found all the trails near me and have been loving it ever since. The maps are very accurate with clicking on the directions tab taking you to your map and right to where you need to start. I love the recording feature that shows what elevation changes you’ll be encountering and all of the data it tracks like distance, pace and even calories burned. Going to my in-laws next week and have already scouted out some trails to go on! Only negative is I wish it wouldn’t chew thru so much battery when recording and tracking your location. 
Love it and maybe we’ll see each other on the trails one day!Been using this app for a while, but it came in really handy on a scout trip to Pisgah National Forest recently. We had an old fashioned map (so the scouts can learn to use it) and compass, but I was also tracking our trek in the app the whole time. We had zero cell phone reception and were deep in the woods with 2,000 feet of climbing, but the app and GPS signal worked flawlessly. Great peace of mind when being responsible for a group of 12-year olds in the woods and quite helpful to show them afterwards what they had just accomplished. Also use it regularly for my own backpacking trips and love being able to create custom routes and then still use them for tracking on the hike itself. Great app!The first time I used Alltrails, it was the free version. The hike we were attempting was very disused, because the first mile had been clear cut and the remaining trail was unmarked and extremely difficult to find among the destruction. By using the real-time GPS tracking, we were able to match out position with the red trail line in Alltrails, and found the hidden trail to an almost forgotten alpine lake. We never would have done it without Alltrails. I purchased the full version of the app later that day, and have never looked back. I maintain my membership in the Washington Trails Association because of the great trail work and advocacy they do, but Alltrails in now my constant hiking and camping companion!I travel for work all over the US and downloading this app was one of the greatest things I’ve ever done. No matter where I go, I can always open the app and find an awesome new place to explore that I never would have found otherwise. The reviews are helpful and most trail difficulty ratings are pretty accurate. I don’t ever get lost because i can always compare the path I’ve taken with what’s on the map. That’s especially helpful when some trails aren’t always heavily marked. The only negative is how badly tracking my trail drains my battery, but that’s the nature of the beast with a constant GPS ping. I would highly recommend using the app the next time you are looking for a new place to explore!I started using All Trails when I took up solo hiking, and it has been well worth it. I always download a copy of the map before every hike. Sometimes trails aren’t well defined in my area, and All Trails gives me peace of mind that I’m literally on the right path. I also share my hike with family every time I go out so they know exactly what trail I’ve taken, which makes me and them feel more confident when I hike on my own. 
My only complaint would be that it is really easy to accidentally turn on tracking on your hike. And that’s it. That is the only complaint I have about this app.This app just makes it easy for finding ideas on where to hike and getting beta on the current conditions of the trails. My only frustration is that while on trail, the app often closes all the way to the start when I have my phone’s screen off. I often have to wait for the app to load and then reselect the trail all over again to see where I am. Most tracking apps just keep that page and you can immediately see your location when you unlock your phone. It’s a good 20secs waiting for this app to reload and then 3 touches to direct it back to where I was. Other than that annoyance I really like it.I would call myself an experienced hiker. I have scaled rocks and cliffs in Red Rock Canyon to find a waterfall with a toddler in a hiking backpack on my back… and I absolutely LOVE this app. I love discovering trails no matter where I am (I’ve only used it in CA) and tracking our hikes, time, and elevation change is awesome. I love being able to see previous hikers photos of a trail, especially when we bring our kids along, because it lets me know if the trail is doable and also if it’s worthwhile. Love, love, love this app. It’s also amazing for finding running trails, I cannot run on concrete anymore. So that is super helpful.I’ve used this app for the past few years and have recommended it to so many others. It is a wonderful tool for finding new trails, seeing reviews about whether it’s worth the trip, current trail conditions, etc. I’m also a Pro member which comes in handy in allowing me to download maps for offline viewing while tracking my GPS location. That feature definitely came in handy with some of my hikes in Colorado where the cell reception was poor. Thank you to everyone on the All Trails team that helps others explore the outdoors!I have been using this app since 2012. The app was rough in the early years but the constant updates have made this an app I don’t want to go without. It’s great at finding new trails near my home. I also love the added feature of it keeping track of your monthly, annual, and lifetime stats. I have used this app all over the country. It works great as a backpacking tracker in the back country of Yellowstone with no cell signal and it works great at my local park. I upgraded to the Pro version this year for the first time and am very happy with it! Great all around Trail app for tracking or finding trails. I highly recommend this app.I love this tracking site. I use it to both plan and record my hiking and mountain bike outings.   
The app allows you to enter a town name and it brings up a list of trails in that area. As you scroll down, it shows you places that are further away from your target town. 
When you select a trail, you see the trail on a map and you can zoom in or out. There are reviews you can read. If you select a person, you can read all of the reviews posted by that person. 

Overall I have found this app to be much easier to use than similar apps such as Strava and Alltrails.Look, I've read over a few of these reviews and responses from alltrails. This app is designed to provide users with plenty of info and details regards trails in your area and it does just that. I HIGHLY recommend the PRO version. You can use the app offline and download any map you want. The overlays and additional map points and details are unmatched on any outdoor trail app ANYWHERE. I AM A VERY EXPERIENCED hiker and I know my way around. However, this app makes me SMART as a hiker and it is excellent for planning, tracking, navigation, etc. I love to record hikes and check photos of other hikers too. IMO. this is the best app out thereI use this app pretty much exclusively when tracking my trek, with verifications other sources. The only suggestion I have for this app is maybe a link or button for connecting trails. Don’t know if that’s possible. I when passing and talking to other people in trail I usually ask where they are going. There are so many connecting trails and different ways to get to places. When searching for a trail to hike in the app it would be super nice to have a way to quickly search for connecting or related trails. 

ThanksI’ve used this app for the past three years- clocking almost 2,000 miles hiking the Colorado Rockies. I have several other trail/navigation apps, but AllTrails is the go-to for navigating and tracking my miles. There are apps that “do” more (more map layers, etc.), but AllTrails is easy to use for finding and recording our next hike and has been 100% reliable. If you’re exploring the outdoors (hiking, biking, etc.) and need an app to help plan your next outing and help you confidently navigate the backcountry- AllTrails is it!I love AllTrails. It’s easy to find new trails and features. It’s easy to download maps and stay on track. It’s easy to share trails with others. 

HORRIBLE that you have so many prompts after the trail to rate/name/add pix… just let me do that separately. 

Also would love a feature that senses when you’re done with your hike and back in your car. Too often I forget to stop tracking and get home with an average pace of 40mph and registers I’ve done 40 miles. Perhaps an “edit” button.I have had this app for a couple years now and also subscribe to the AllTrails pro subscription. This app has enabled me to find countless hikes and give me important information about what I can expect from the hike as well as tracking my stats on these hikes. I really enjoy this app and will continue to use it indefinitely, after this most recent update I’m really loving the new preview feature it is super neat. Thank you AllTrails for helping me and my family get more out of being outdoors!If you like to hike paying for this app is 1000% worth it! Directions straight to any trailhead, tracking lots at elements of your hike and feedback from other users. Best feature is the ability to download maps then you can use your phone to keep on the trail for the whole hike. The app is continuously updated and improved. Sometimes the mileage can be a bit off but I think they take an average of the different hikes from people tracking.I’ve found this both useful for discovering hikes to try, and also for tracking my progress while on the hike. I also like the security feature of being able to send my real time progress to a selected friend.  Of course if you are hiking someplace without cell service you lose some of those benefits 🤷‍♀️but so far has worked well for my purposes (not doing true wilderness hiking)Great app for trails. I use it for downloading reliable trail maps to be used off grid while hiking in the backcountry. GPS tracking works great and you can run it in airplane mode to save battery and still track yourself. It helps you stay on the trail, track distances, speed, elevation. Very pleased. If you are a hiker the paid version is totally worth it. You can even create your own maps when you the the online version(not the app)I had a “to visit” list where I had put hundreds of trails for the future and now it’s completely blank. Really messed up, especially when I pay $30 a year for the full version. Very disappointing because otherwise this is a 5 star app.

*Changing my rating since my lost list re-appeared. It’s a fantastic app that has brought me lots of joy and the tracking is pretty on point.*I’m new to hiking and this app is one of the main reason I’m loving it. Taking the guest work out of finding trails makes it so much more enjoyable. Plus, tracking progress and digitally recording your adventures is a blast!!! I used the free app for about 3 months and it has everything you need. I recently purchase the upgraded plan and I’m loving g the new features.

I highly recommend this app and am so appreciative of the person. That created it!The app (paid level) is excellent and provides fantastic real-time detail whether I have a signal or not (magic!). We have thousands of acres of off-the-grid and out-of-cell-service hiking in Idaho and All Trails has yet to fail me. If you are serious about knowing before you go, tracking while going, and sharing your results, this app is a must-have.Great for exploring new areas, staying on trail and tracking your accomplishments! 

I travel a lot and I love to find a trail to hike, bike or run. AllTrails easily lets me find what I’m looking for by using the filters feature, then I can confidently navigate that trail knowing I will be notified if I get off track. Using the lifeline feature is an additional tool that my family is greatful for. 

I really enjoy having a log of all the hikes I've completed with detailed stats for each of them. 

Lastly, I have had to contact customer service a few time for assistance and I have had nothing but fast, friendly, thorough and professional service. 

Now get out there, explore, record and enjoy the great reward of the outdoors!Not going to lie, the free version is awesome if you just spend some time with it and figure it out, but for the price and what you get for the pro monthly exc takes it to another level, we have done smokies, sedona, st Augustin and so many other places. Using there tracking service, waypoint markers and also just knowing of the trails in the area to get out of the everyday tourist stuff. Highly recommend for any outdoor personThis is a great app for anyone who is directionally challenged, as I am. I get lost very easily, and this app with it’s time updated tracking prevents that. In addition, if I’m hiking with my parents who are in their 70s, I can set parameters such as length and difficulty level, to find trails that they can go with me on. It also helps you to explore areas that you wouldn’t know about otherwise. One of my most used apps on my phone!I got this app for one specific long mountain climb that I wanted to ensure I had offline map access for, but now I use it for every little neighborhood hike. It’s not only great for tracking deep woods location when hiking but also for memorializing all the little hikes I take too. Absolutely worth the annual subscription price. I got my money’s worth on the first trip! Easy 5/5One issue that I’ve had a couple of times: If you neglect to stop tracking at the end of the hike, then the drive away from the trailhead (say) will distort the record and the statistics. It would be great to have a way to edit that out, so that we can keep a faithful log of the actual hiking.  

Thank you for this great app.Have used this app for a few years to track many out door activities from hiking, to biking and off road jeeping in the high country of Colorado. Recording and tracking is very helpful for staying in trail and on track. Love the alerts for missing turns on OHV tracks and the topo and satellite map overlays are stunning and helpful. Look no further for you outdoor adventure help app than AllTrails!I have always had this overwhelmingly natural desire to “run up a mountain”. I never knew how to do it and AllTrails was my savior. Directions to Trail heads was all I needed, but it has provided so much more with tracking my runs and not to mention the amazing evidence of my trail metrics to look back on. I review to motivate myself, outdo myself overpower myself. An empty tank is what fills my soul, so thank you, AllTrails for helping me to aim for the peaks!!!This app is incredible for me.  It will find me trails I didn’t know existed near me and it will help me navigate them, which is a great way to minimize stress and let you enjoy your surroundings.
Plus tracking my history of mileage walked is very helpful to keep me on track with exercising.
All in all, fantastic.

P.S. - I don’t know the last time I wrote a review for an app.  So, that may say something, too!I love this app!  Where I live there are many trails and this helps me locate the right trail, I use it to record my hike, I can make sure I’m going the right way as it’s very accurate where the trail is vs where you are.  Even though I don’t have service on my hikes I download the trail before I head out (I use the free version) and the tracking works great.  I then have a record of where I have hiked.My number one issue hiking without AllTrails was that I would often cross path with say a bike route… 1/2 mile later - location is a mystery - wasting time backtracking… with AllTrails - you will get an audible alert that you have gone off path!  Having fun learning more of the capabilities as days go by.  Happy subscriber…I’ve never left an app review before, but I was so impressed by AllTrails I wanted to share my experience. I had downloaded the GPS for a big ski tour/climb. The weather was beautiful all day but at the summit we were caught in a total white out and got very turned around. Even in the remote wilderness this map tracking was able to help us figure out where to go and get down safe!So I’m not a big app user because I don’t like to have a lot of stuff on my phone but the All Trails app is worth the $ for a 53 yo woman. I hiked with it yesterday and easily followed the directions for my first hike and enjoyed the tracking features immensely. I also enjoyed knowing what point of interest I was looking at along the way. I definitely recommend this app.I’ve used All Trails all over the U.S. and it’s the only app that has up to date reviews. I love how it tracks me even when I don’t have service. I fee safe when hiking alone because of the tracking feature. It’s reliable and functional. I recommend All Trails to anyone about to go on an adventureI got this app when I took the wrong trail and hiked much further than I wanted. I am just getting back in shape and I like all the trails listed, rated and reviewed. I also like the gps tracking so I know I’m on the right trail. I bought the year subscription and never regretted it. I never knew there was so many trails around me. It has encouraged me to get outside moreLove this app, I have a few others similar to it but definitely use this one more than the others. The other apps are more tracking and data style. This one does a lot of that, but what I like is that you can look for and browse for new trails anywhere.Love that people can leave reviews, pictures, and you can share trails with others. Has a tracking feature as well. Very good map location of the trails, so you can screenshot and send to family so they know where you are planning to go. 
12/10 recommend this app!!I am new to hiking and absolutely love this app. I keep it on while I’m walking so I can easily see if I have gone off route. The mile marker function is extremely accurate, which makes tracking my runs awesome as well. Would definitely recommend.My daughter and I were hiking a lesser used trail in the Talimena’s when we entered an area where the trails were overgrown from previous years forest fires. The app allowed us to work our way through about 2-3 miles of forrest that had overgrown the trails as it recovered. Saved us about 3-4 miles of backtracking and finding a different trail.I used to hike all the time, but took a break. This app has so many features, even the free version, that it MAKES me super motivated to get out on the trail even more. I don’t fear getting lost and I can plan for weather and incline. The pictures people post are super helpful and the interactive tracking with elevation is great. Great tool.. thank you!This is a great app. I don’t hike without it now. Lots of useful features (trail reviews, pics, notes and tracking feature). Highly recommend if you are a hiker. 

Best feature was the one I least expected, the search/filter. Allows you to hone in on exactly what type of hike or length you’re looking for.AllTrails is my go-to app for deciding what routes to follow. I also use it to track my progress. I’ve found the maps and tracking better than my GPS mapping device. I still carry that as it allows for emergency notification and communication. AllTrails is also great for exploring an area.Great at tracking but I wish you could save trails and use an “offline mode” to access them since most of the places I hike have no service. It’s an awesome resource for finding new trails. I love the elevation-distance tracer feature as I can see it on the map as well!Easy to use, I like the recording and tracking features built in, and the trail ratings are actually useful. 

I’ve used other hiking apps for finding day hikes and AllTrails is hands down my favorite. Easy to explore by area and the GPS tracking is great. The community is helpful as well.The maps are much better than everything else out there. Great tracking functionality and accurate location details. Reviews are fantastic.

I also don’t understand why they don’t add some space for users to make notes on hikes (like “do counterclockwise for easier descent” etc), why user reviews from various hikes take up most of the screen space when saved lists are viewed from the desktop site (how is that in any way helpful??), etc. etc. I don’t even know what the developers’ goals are anymore but certainly usability / user satisfaction does not rank very high.

One improvement can be to add the ability to see “remaining distance” for a hike. Just saw that “remaining time” feature was added. The pace differs from person to person and so that is not very helpful.

Ideally one plans few way points for a full hike. It is useful to identify (mark) waypoints and get a “remaining distance to the next waypoint” presented as a motivator to accomplish planned goals and keep to a planned schedule.

The offline maps show the GPS location on the map and the elevation at the point can be seen. So I am surprised why not the remaining distance to the next waypoint or end of the trail?

I also see that the interface to using a “pause” in the middle of the hike is very unintuitive. Pause state changed to hold after a few seconds -  not sure what that implies. Realized that a long hold on the hold moves to a different UI state that has a resume option.One of my main goals for using the app was to track my hiking history and compare hikes. 

First gap I encountered was the inability to add hikes from before I installed the app. I have been hiking for years and most of the trails I’ve hiked are in the trail database. It should be straightforward to add a hikes distance and elevation gain using start and end waypoints to my history. 

Second issue was when inspecting the trails on the map you can’t select 2 waypoints and see the distance and elevation gain between the two. 

Lastly when looking at the list of waypoints on a trail, the only statistic shown are the coordinates. Seems very strange to omit the elevation and the distance from the trailhead here. Including estimated hike times would be hugely useful for planning. Most park maps include this and this app has actual telemetry data to use here as well.  

In short, not a very good cataloging or planning tool.

Love running from 5ks up to marathon and last few years I have become head over heals for ultras and crazy races. However outside of races I would almost always train on roads. I discovered some awesome trails near my new home and brought be back to high school cross county days. This app allows me to
See Trail options I would have never been aware of even ones I have driven by for over a year. I once had a goal of running every road in my town. Now through this app my new goals is to Run every trail in the local trail systems.Absolutely love this app! Makes getting out there so much easier and safe. 
 
It would be a great addition to add a feature that senses when you’ve began moving again on the trail, just like it gives you an alert when you’re off-route (which is incredible by the way!). Sometimes I pause it to eat a snack and totally forget to restart it. :( 

The only actual concern I have is that I’m not sure I can trust the calorie counter on it. My Health app on my watch always shows drastically different #s, and I just can’t feel comfortable trusting AllTrails’ high #s (sometimes twice the amount) on my daily tracker. 

A super cool addition just for enjoyment would be a way to have a goal tracker. Such as a hiking miles or elevation gain goals for the month. That’s just extra but I know I would love it!! 

Thanks for the work on this amazing product! I use it religiously on my days off haha. :)I love this app to find local walking or hiking trails. I live in Orange Count, CA, and Santa Barbara, CA, alternatively city and rural. The app is great for finding trials in both places. The ratings are accurate, including helpful photos and comments as well as a simple star rating and easy-difficult scale. My favorite feature is being able to track the hike/walk as I’m going. It’s helped me not get lost, as well as keep to my mileage goals! Thank you creators!!I use this app constantly and have never been disappointed. You can find some true gems through their collection of trails. The categorization and review system is really helpful in choosing which trails best fit your adventurous goals for the day and the pictures don’t spoil everything you get to see along the way.

I’ve been using the Pro version of this app for over 6 years and it seems to me that you keep switching features around catering more to a social media look, which is fine. But I am not sure where you get the user experience input because I can tell you that it’s not us, the long time users. I rely heavily on my history to find previously used tracks I built and hiked. Last year you put the historical activity on a different tab, harder to locate. Fine, I guess, more cumbersome but I have adjusted. With the version released a couple of weeks ago, you made it even more cumbersome to get to, not intuitive at all, it’s now under profile! 
To make matters even worse, you didn’t add a search feature on the activity history on the app!!! I had to read the FAQ’s and community comments (read complaints) to find out it’s only available on the computer. 
This is unacceptable. Especially after you increased the price of the subscription this year. 
Please fix the app and add the history back. To make it better, put the history back on a more intuitive and less cumbersome to find location. 
I’m really considering switching to another app if this is not something you will fix soon.I’ve been a user for years but I’ve given up on AllTrails, switching to another app that focuses more on maps and routing and less on reviews, photos and more social media focused functionality.

I just want to find interesting trails, track my hike, make sure I stay on the route, and get back safely

I grew tired of getting nagged about the same trails each time I launch the app, and nag to rate, leave reviews, and upload photos after use.

Tracking got spoiled too many times to when I forgot to stop it. Competitor apps allow you to fix this problem. And maintain your history more accurately.

All trails does have the largest selection of routes available for use, but this is a very solvable problem with any of the competitor apps.

If AllTrails should ever make it possible to just use the app without being nagged to share experiences so much, I might consider using it again",0,The new version is terrible!Too much focus on social media functionality,trail_ninjartphokie,"{'id': 36483213, 'body': ""We appreciate the feedback on this change.

A lot of pop ups and adds to download more, but those are easy enough to close out.The latest update that prioritizes local trails when searching is great.  Makes the app much more useful for discovery.

There are two things that would make it even better.

As someone else pointed out, an iPad app that works in landscape would make discovery even better.  An external keyboard for input and larger viewing area for information would be nice touches.

A history of trails I've looked at would be great as well.  My wife tends to airdrop me trail ideas but there's no history of them so after about four I have no idea what the earlier trails were.  Just a simple MRU list would do wonders as we compare trails for our next outing.I really do like All Trails for the directions to the trails and the general accuracy of the trails when on them.

You have to re enter the trail name fully even after you just looked up the same trail minutes ago which is very annoying.

Please put check-in back where it belongs, it’s a critical feature, and right map loads with the name of the trail on the saved history. 
I also agree with the other user about trail hopping.  In New England many trails connect but are listed separately.  If you are no longer on the same one you started it appears you are just going rogue on the map.  How about auto loading the newly entered trail?
Also being able to edit history would be helpful. There’s been a couple times where I started driving home and forgot to hit pause and save.  And why the “pause” button when the trail is complete?  It’s a weird way to “finish” or “end hike”.

Two, it makes finding new trails easy, especially with the filters. And third, it makes me feel safe because I can download the map before I go and when I’m on the trail with no reception, I can track exactly where I am and where I’m headed - it’s saved us quite a few times from getting lost on some of the trails! Couple of suggestions: 1) have a “daily report” that people can update in regards to conditions of that hike on that particular day/week (don’t always want to scour reviews for that) - we went on a hike that was incredibly overgrown over the summer and encountered a bees nest in the midst of it and really did not enjoy it. 2) be able to tick off trails we have done and have a “past trails” list or “history” list that isn’t tied to recordings or anything. Otherwise, great job! Thanks!I love AllTrails for its detailed coverage of, well, all trails. I love how easy it is to see the whole trail from an arial view so I can plan my hike. I’m impressed with the level of detail and how well the GPS tracks me on the trail even when I’m out of cellular range.

But I don’t love that I can’t browse a map, find something that looks interesting, and drop a couple of pins to figure out the distance and elevation gain between those points. I either have to extrapolate from the map data, or I record it when I walk and then save it in my history. Those options are little help for planning.Haven’t used the app since last summer and was delighted finding the new update! I love new navigation options and the history of trails in the profile and stats and all of these. The only thing that could be better - fix the request to access photos! It’s annoying to go through “selected photos” every time you want to add photos to the reviewExtremely pleased with this app! Very informative and easy to navigate. Instead of spending hrs on the laptop making a list of potential trails I’d like to try I can simply click on the app, filter what I’m looking for in an area I want to go and bam! me and the dog are on the road. The app even redirects you to a map app to get you to the trail head! I love the History and Stats options too so I can keep track of where we’ve been and always look for new trails. Love Love Love!!This app has reintroduced me to the great out doors! I’m so happy that a friend suggested it to me. Now, and particularly because of COVID, I want my exercise regime to continue. Where better than in the midst of Gods glory. I know that sounds cheesy, but I never appreciated the beauty of this country more than I do now, and am learning about our history through parks and trails. Who would have thunk it?

 I’m even looking to buy a bike now so I can tryout some bike trails. 

Job well done, folks!Has been using this for three years and find it very useful for hiking, running and biking.
Few points which are would make it even better than what it already is:
- in a search by park/area - list all associated trails in the park
- being able to see activities, history&stats by type of activities. i.e. hiking, biking etcThis app is incredible for me.  It will find me trails I didn’t know existed near me and it will help me navigate them, which is a great way to minimize stress and let you enjoy your surroundings.
Plus tracking my history of mileage walked is very helpful to keep me on track with exercising.
All in all, fantastic.

P.S. - I don’t know the last time I wrote a review for an app.  So, that may say something, too!This is an awesome app that I have used through several Adirondack and National park hikes. Also has local city hike information As well. I highly recommend getting the paid version if you enjoy hiking - it keeps your history and the offline navigation is awesome and sometimes incredibly usefulI love this app and use it almost every week. 

I’m not a big fan of taking away the “history” button at the bottom however. I noticed it gone after the most recent update.This app has kept me out of trouble by keeping me on trail.  The reviews are current and you know the ‘secrets’ of the trail before you hit the trailhead.    The history feature helps with remembering insights you had trail previously.  I appreciate this app so much.",0,"Very useful!You are better than Google Maps, but you could still learn a thing or two from them.The updated version of the app is absolutely amazing!Hands down, fav app on my phone!!OutsideGreat appFantastic tool for hikersfantastic resourceLove the app, not a fan of one part of the update.All trails unique benefits",legallybonniejenystaimanshturwalezzz@Moe Moe MonsterDJR301valdimirMPeppwavehawkAwaybeachMarley311LynnRL,"{'id': 36826814, 'body': ""Hello - thanks so much for the information here.

There are a couple improvements I would love to suggest:
-Ability to share entire lists with others/maybe even collaborate with other members
-Easier method to add trails that don't already exist in your database
-More stability and consistency in performance. Frustrating when my offline map crashes repeatedly and I'm trying to find my route
- An iPad app. Please!!!

Highly recommend this app! Especially as improvements are continually rolled out. :-)",0,Love this app! ... but it could use some upgrades,glutenfreelyfe,0,All Trails Hike Bike Run,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,122,has_collab,1

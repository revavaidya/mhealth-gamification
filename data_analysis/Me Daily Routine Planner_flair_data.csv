This app offers so many capabilities without having to pay. You can make checklists under activities and events. It gives you suggestions of things to add to your schedule. Events/activities are very customizable. It has a list of routines to try from hot spring to-dos to work out and cleaning routines. You can set alarms, track your sleep, listen to soundscapes and meditations, and check broadcasts. Broadcasts includes a great overview of how you slept including percentages of when you woke up during the night and when you were in light sleep and deep sleep. It also has sound recordings of your night. Weather in your area and fun history facts. They also give out free or discounted membership opportunities. It‚Äôs honestly a great experience and I feel more confident and in control of my schedule than ever before!after seeing all that this app has to offer, I have recently decided to get the full experience by paying for the unlimited version. as someone with ADHD that is actively trying to find ways to work on organization and self discipline habits, i love how this has so many features that are GENUINELY helpful and enticing.

however, the ONLY suggestion that i have so far is that the timers that you can set have little challenges ‚Äî which is exactly what i wanted ‚Äî but i would love it even more if it could make you physically GET UP. like if it would be able to track your steps! i know this suggestion may get lost in the plethora of reviews, but i would absolutely love to see that!",0,Best App I‚Äôve Downloaded-ADHD Win!This app is amazing!!

The title looks like a bad translation, the concept is pretty niche, and the elements in the routine are broad and (again) contain no extra help or direction. 
Overall, the routines are broken down into overly broad and generic steps. With ADHD, that can be overwhelming and more hassle than it‚Äôs worth to customize it.

Cons:
Doesn‚Äôt integrate with calendars as so many other apps do. This is an  ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY feature for individuals w/ ADHD to appropriately orient their day. This is a HUGE drawback, and will cause me not to use this particular app.

Having a brief synopsis of the daily news is also very time efficient since I am almost too busy to have hours to read the news. And the sleep music and meditations are also helpful because I love having peaceful music to sleep by. 

However, I am about to cancel my premium subscription because I want to track my sleep. This part of the app doesn‚Äôt appear to be working properly. For one thing, it is stuck on two days ago. Today is April 14, but the data will only show for April 12.  I have attempted to reset it on the calendar but the calendar will not allow me to change the date. I am also concerned about the level of accuracy for my sleep tracking. It shows that I was awake for 2 hours the other night (I have no idea about last night or the night before because of the inability to change the date.) I really don‚Äôt think that I was awake that much because it isn‚Äôt supported by the ‚Äúsounds‚Äù recordings.There are grammar errors all over the app from the broadcast talking in past tense when it should be present tense, to missing spaces or spelling errors. 

The app itself is more tedious than I thought it would be. I thought it would start as a guided process to help motivate me such as quizzes to find out what tasks would best for me and where to start based off my needs, but all the willpower had to come from me. 

The sleep tracking is not very accurate at all compared to others. I am okay with that as I know that wasn‚Äôt the main goal, but if you are gonna have it I would compare with Fitbit‚Äôs or Apple‚Äôs to see what kind of quality people expect. Some past apps I‚Äôve tried allowed 3rd party apps which allowed me to use ones that I know work while still using the their app for everything else.

I would love to see a different medal system for each day. As someone with major depression, anxiety and adhd, many days my personal goal of how many to complete is 3 tasks maybe 5 even if have 30 tasks I want to track. It would be nice to be able to see the days I do super well versus the days I do one task. 

I do plan on getting the subscription as I think it‚Äôs a fair deal for other apps I have tried. With this in mind I do hope my review reaches the developers as these things will eventually need to be fixed if they want to keep me for multiple months/years.I switched to paying for this app from another very similar app to try something different. the other app did not have sleep tracking, so that was an additional feature I was looking for.  I like having the weather, my horoscope, sleep report, and the news all in one spot - the daily broadcast. However, the horoscope doesn‚Äôt fully show, and there is no way to click into it. Some days it says something with a cliffhanger- like  ‚ÄúSomeone who has asked you for help may be involved with something that could end up b‚Ä¶‚Äù and leaves you hanging. This is very annoying and something I would like to see the developers fix.Hello!

I love the app and it‚Äôs ideas.

There are a few things I‚Äôm hoping to bring up to have changed/fixed:

1. I‚Äôm not able to change the time of day that my habits fall under. They all appear under ‚Äúany time of day‚Äù and I‚Äôd like to be able to change them to morning, afternoon, and evening if possible. 

2. When habits are completed, the following days consistently rearrange the habits and this causes me to have to reorganize them every day. Sometimes, new habits don‚Äôt appear immediately as well.

3. The constant pop ups to pay for premium are a bit annoying honestly. Everytime the ‚Äúspin the wheel‚Äù pops up, I hard reset the app and reopen because it takes too long to go through the animation just to offer me to pay for premium for the fifteeth time that day. Could you please limit the number of times the pop up occurs?

Please fix, as this app could easily be the best habit tracking app if those things were ironed out! Possibly worth paying for in the future, but not as it stands now with the issues above.

As someone with ADHD and depression, this app helps remind and motivate me to do basic tasks each day. I‚Äôm often terrible at remembering if I‚Äôve taken my meds and this app has helped me stay consistent with taking them. When in a depressive episode, basic tasks like washing my face & brushing my teeth can fall to the wayside. This app helps motivate me & remind me to do those basic tasks. Being able to check off one small task like washing your face when in a depressive episode can feel like a huge accomplishment. 

My one pet peeve is that the widget does not refresh on its own. I also wish the data review for tracking habits was more user friendly and visually appealing like the ‚ÄúHabit‚Äù app.

And I haven‚Äôt seen but I think premium is like pretty cheap a month.The UI for this app is amazing. I love everything about it. Seriously, this is a one-stop shop for everything I could ask for (from workout routines, to sleep scheduling, diet information, mood tracking, etc etc etc)

This app has it all and I think it might be one that I actually use consistently just because it literally has it all and is SO user friendly.I use this app because I was not really good at keeping tracking my stuff but I saw this app everywhere and I wanted to give it a try and whenever I tried it just for a few hours it actually really helped because honestly I would‚Äôve been laying down for the rest of the day if I haven‚Äôt found this.‚ò∫Ô∏èthis app is really where i navigate too whenever i‚Äôm feeling like my phone is consuming too much of my time and attention. I enjoy everything the app has to offer tracking my mood, journal entries, and always having motivational material to look over to bring back my productivity.I was recommended this app in an ad on tik tok and i have been very impressed by how many features it has! Planner, sleep tracking, affirmations, workouts, meditation, soundscapes and more! My ADHD makes task management difficult but this has helped me find a routine ans stick to it.

I‚Äôve always struggled/procrastinated planning out my own routine so I figured that ‚ÄúMe+‚Äù would be the perfect app to assist me.

It was great at first, answered some good questions and set my priorities/goals for this app.. but then after, a subscription popped up. Now this I expected to happen so I just skipped and tried continuing.. 

But yet again I‚Äôm greeted with SO MANY POP UPS.. everywhere I tapped and looked there was always little advertisements for subscriptions

Not only that but there isn‚Äôt really any real tutorial on how to navigate the app so I was just left to figure it out for myself WHILE trying to get past those advertisements..

There‚Äôs just too many on the screen that it makes it hard for me to navigate where I need to go; it looks unorganized and messy

This COULD have been a good app, perhaps even a GREAT app.. but it ruined it for me by the overwhelming amount of advertising of subscriptionsTLDR; complicated regulated setup with little benefit. 

I was looking for something to help me plan and track goals. But after spending 20 minutes answering questions about whether I procrastinate or feel overwhelmed the app itself overwhelmed me.  Then asked me if I want a drink of water ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è still could not find the section to set what I as the user and subscriber wanted. What a waste of time. 

If you‚Äôre trying to help people with ADHD and anxiety who are short on time maybe don‚Äôt take so much time and require focused attention from the ADHD user for initial simple setup with only a SEVEN day free trial. Can‚Äôt believe people are recommending this.I don‚Äôt have the time to create a schedule. When I saw the (countless) ads for this app, I thought the app would give you a questionnaire or something about your available time and goals and it would auto generate a suggested schedule based on that (like for example, tackling cleaning tasks during the week when on a busy schedule). However, you have to create your own schedule and add tasks yourself. With all the things I need/want to do its just too overwhelming to figure it out and I ended up not creating any schedule. This app is just not for me.I was really excited to download this as i‚Äôve been struggling in a lot of self image and routine things lately. It was really disappointing to see that several of the goals to set were focused around making your body look a certain way, like weighing yourself in the morning or shaving to have a ‚Äúbeach body!‚Äù Overall, will definitely be looking elsewhere for a habit tracker that doesn‚Äôt focus on certain appearance standards.I am not satisfied as I could not see the options of planning prior to subscribing, I believe it was very misleading. You cannot add your own goals or anything. There was nothing that would match my needs and that was kind of unsetting. Either we should be able to see prior to purchasing or let us make our own ones as wellCan we seriously get weight loss off of the list of self care goals? Science shows us that dieting just makes us miserable and also leads to long term weight gain.

None of these pre made plans applied to me. There were lots of one size fits all office worker / computer jockey plans. Not so much for professional musicians who want to make a practice and rehearsal schedule.

Also, anyone can make a three step plan to shop for, cook, and share food. In what way is that supposed to be novel or help me.

This app feels slapped together and in no way useful for anyone who isn‚Äôt living in a particular box.Unless you want to spend $$ on a fancy to-do list then don‚Äôt get it. 

I wish they had some free options but no. Nothing more than a money scam. 

Please, just go and get a cute notebook and write down goals and to-dos and save yourself the time and money.",0,Overwhelming Ads & Hard to NavigateSo wanted to like this app‚Ä¶Another task‚Ä¶Negative Habit BuildingThe optionsDiet culture is not self careCosts too much money,HentaiiWaifuuDocski71JoylpzLugrpaSamantha.V.35<3TeteSagehenDfghhhhvgffffff,Me Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine PlannerMe Daily Routine Planner,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,705,has_goals,47

It is beyond frustrating to spend my time creating a routine and then wanting or needing to adjust it and not being able to!

I was hoping I could add times to my daily goals to keep me on a schedule instead of getting to them whenever. As someone who is looking for some organization in their life, I need accountability, and having the option to set times with my daily goals would help. I was also a little disappointed in the exercise options and was the main reason I paid for the app. I know this isn‚Äôt a workout app so I don‚Äôt want to complain, but I was thinking it‚Äôd be a little bit more for what I got after paying. 

I do still think this is a lovely app and I believe it is helping the people who are having good experiences, it just isn‚Äôt for me.I‚Äôve used this app for quite some time now and I‚Äôve never had any issues until recently. It seems like every month or twice a month all of my habits get deleted and I have to add them over and over again and when they disappear some of them I can‚Äôt add back because it‚Äôs says it‚Äôs already a habit that exists BUT IT DOESNT and some I can‚Äôt edit so they all just sit at ‚Äúany time of day‚Äù instead of them being scheduled‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt wanna have to keep doing this so I‚Äôll most likely move to another app because I have too much to do to be fumbling with an app that‚Äôs supposed to help with whatever goal you‚Äôre on and not add stress It was a wonderful app when I first got it but it‚Äôs not that wonderful anymore if all of my goals get thrown outSo I downloaded this app because I have HUGE issues with procrastination and I need a schedule to stick to! But as I was trying this app I went to make a schedule and I have to get premium, I understand that y‚Äôall have to make money but it would be nice if you capfuls watch an add or maybe even earn gems after logging in or completing goals do that day so you can use it on other premium things, I just don‚Äôt have the ability to do premium right now so it would be appreciated if you could make some changes other than that ok app!This seems Like a  great app to let you get your life organized, it sends you reminders and has list of goals that you get to pick to check off. But With these kinda apps there is always a twist, you have to pay which is really dumb in my opinion because you should not have to pay for a life organization app and as a person who doesn‚Äôt have a Job o can‚Äôt afford to pay $40 for an appI‚Äôm so confused they literally just got rid of the ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù Option where it asks you what time of the day you‚Äôll goals will notify you so they are all under ‚Äúany time of day‚Äù. The goals are still set for the specific hours of the day I want them to go off but it‚Äôs annoying because they aren‚Äôt organized :((((((I really enjoy the app as it helps me remember self care and cleaning goals throughout the week. Only to find that one day all your data completely disappears. All your goals, carefully created task lists, timers, completion data - all gone. I could cry I‚Äôm so sad the app cleared itself somehow. And to think I paid over $30 for full access :(I can get confusing sometimes.

You can plan out your day or you can just make a list of things that you need to get done. It‚Äôs free, add free, and you can also pay only 1.70$ a month for premium wich is very affordable. You can also set goals like do this this this many times today and you can create your own step by step checklist. With my adhd I often can‚Äôt get things done because I can‚Äôt focus or because I don‚Äôt know where to start or I‚Äôll get stressed by all the stuff I have to do but with this app I can just do things step by step, little by little. I I‚Äôve had this app for not even two days but my mental health is already improving and I‚Äôm genuinely so much happier and more productive. So for anyone looking at the reviews seeing if they should get it or not, this app is a ten out of ten and you should definitely get it. Big thanks to the creators of this app for improving my lifestyle.Having ADD I can truthfully say this is the best productivity app I‚Äôve tried. So many others force you to create your routines, habits and schedules all by yourself. Most productivity apps start in a place of customization. By the time you figure out what schedule you want to choose, when you want to do it and how often you lose momentum it‚Äôs so exhausting you want to quit. The beauty of this app is that there are routine templates based on who you are and what you want to achieve and then you just add those goals/routines it to your custom one. Just the right amount of free choice but mixed so much with outlines that are pre-set you don‚Äôt have to figure a lot out. Definitely recommend - worth the hype. My only suggestion/request if possible would be to add a goal template that includes pets. When to walk them, spend time with them, take them to the vet, get them groomed. No points taken off though - this is awesome!I have been needing to have a schedule and I have been over all over the place lately but ever since I‚Äôve gotten this app I have been more organized this is an AMAZING and easy app that has been helping me on the way but.. you have to pay for almost EVERYTHING you even have to pay for why fruits and vegetables and other foods are good for you.. that‚Äôs outrageous also when you make a reminder like on the calendar part and you can make your own goals, when you have a time goal if you go out of the app eve for a second the timer starts like what if you want it to still go on but you lose track and everything! Anyways this is a great app I would highly suggest that you would get this app if you have anxiety or depression issues or you just need a check list or something to keep you on trackI definitely love this app. I have been struggling with my late ADHD diagnosis, and by some big stuff happening in my life and was feeling completely lost. With this app I feel more organized, focused, and on track. You can time up reminders so you know when to do some of your daily goals, you can even find some pre-designed goals, and you can adjust them for your benefit. I love this. In the little time I have been using it I can definitely say that it has changed my life. I am so glad I found it. 100% RecommendedOkay I admit I found it though my adhd daughter. I noticed a change in her. She was actually cleaning her room. Oh not by only that  She kept it cleaner. This was including her chores on the weekend too! She told me how she was using timers and the reminders on this app. We both love Me+. I added crocheting time for myself as a reward for completing my house chores and love it! It also let me set heathy goals so I started out with drinking more water. It helps remind you to take small sips! Which I love. Thank you so much for making this app!!!!This cute little app really helps me feel like I‚Äôve achieved goals by doing the simplest things. 

It also has a happy journal that I love, it asks to to write down what you are happiest about today on the daily. I love that, it makes be put into perspective how lucky I am even for the smallest things. It also make me realize that I am making strides and I can work with this crippling ADHD and Over come! 

Love this app overall, can‚Äôt wait to find out more and see more features.

(I don't have it) it's still a great app for Checklists, and staying organized! Most people think it's for money but if you click out of those, it's completely free. This is a really great app for everyone with goalsThere is yoga, exercises, and even meditation. Totally would recommend downloading the app. It can get you to be who you want to be and it's easy to use this app!The best app you have to get a subscription if you want some premium thing but it is amazing without paying you take  this little quiz at the beginning about your personality then it helps you set goals and then you can mark off things it‚Äôs the same as the adds are and you only have to watch like 1 add every long time it‚Äôs amazing highly recommendThis app is very life-changing and patient it asks you questions about the negative and good and sets goals for the future. This really has changed my life. I think I‚Äôm starting to be more productive. and definitely more focused on the good things. I really recommend this app if you‚Äôre trying to change your life and start off fresh and new. Thank you so much‚Äù me app.Me + has helped me with my self-care and doing things around the house and I have reached a lot of goals ever since downloading this app, and my cousin has downloaded this app as well and she loves it to. I hope if you are reading this review that you would like to download me + tooIt helps me set goals and achieve them everyday. I just wish they would stop trying to get me to pay for all Me+ features, it‚Äôs super annoying. But overall it‚Äôs a great app, and you really don‚Äôt need to pay for all features.Life is busy.

However, I have some critiques:
1. If you set a task (one-time) for any day other than the present day (aka in the future), you cannot edit it. It simply says 'let's focus on today' when I try to edit it. 
2. The 'help' center is small.
3. You cannot look at your subscription status or history in the app. You have to manage it through the app store, which is less clear.
4. If you're a new subscriber with a coupon from the spin-the-wheel you do not get a 7 week trial.

I personally find it disgusting and discouraging that loads of other apps take advantage of the challenges neurodivergent people face when they are just trying to make their life a bit easier and more organized. This app offers so many capabilities without having to pay. You can make checklists under activities and events. It gives you suggestions of things to add to your schedule. Events/activities are very customizable. It has a list of routines to try from hot spring to-dos to work out and cleaning routines. You can set alarms, track your sleep, listen to soundscapes and meditations, and check broadcasts. Broadcasts includes a great overview of how you slept including percentages of when you woke up during the night and when you were in light sleep and deep sleep. It also has sound recordings of your night. Weather in your area and fun history facts. They also give out free or discounted membership opportunities.

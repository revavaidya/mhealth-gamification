The longer time spent using the free version, the more abilities that they limit. After using the app for a week, they eliminated information necessary for understanding your progress. I really enjoyed the app, but it should still have options available for those who do not wish to subscribe.I was supper excited about this app. It is well made, looked amazing and the games are awesome. But you are limited to only daily challenges and i wanted to play all day. So i purchased what i thought was a monthly subscription of $2.90 something cents only to be charged a lump sum of $34 for the entire year.

My main complaint is the system that requires you to get an overall score before you can unlock new levels for games. It’s entirely possible for one area of focus to keep you from progressing in others which is extremely frustrating. I understand why this choice was made, but unless you add more content to all areas, you will reach a plateau and you won’t progress further, locking things you enjoy behind walls you can’t remove. Please either add games to all areas of focus, not just a few, so there is a better chance to raise the overall score or change that overall score as being what unlocks new challenges in each area to each area unlocks the more you progress. And no, it’s not a case of try harder. When I’ve spent hours attempting to better my score and I’ve reached a peak performance and I have limited choices in raising that score, it’s no longer only holding myself back, but the app design. I suppose a third option of lowering what’s required to unlock new content is also a tweak than a design change would also work.

I feel like I’ve paid for way more than I’m getting and that’s disappointing.I paid for yearly pro and will be deleting this shortly.  Too many games depend on a timer or a twitch reflex response.  If you want real challenges to train your mind you have to buy the extras ... after I paid the yearly fee. Just so disappointed in this.   A couple games are interesting but cease being fun with the incessant nag telling me “I can do better than this”.  Yes, I can do better, I will delete this app and find a better program on the app store.  I regret this purchase.I don’t care how good your app is. If your goal is to force me to succumb to a paywall to get better content, your goal isn’t to train my brain. Your goal is conditioning me to open my wallet.

Plus what athlete does a single drill once and leaves it? Not any respectable one. If you want to train something, you keep drilling it until you’ve improved. So if I need to play 6 days in a row to take another crack at low pop, I might as well be trying it for the first time.

I was very impressed with the quality of the challenges presented until I was handed the developer’s walls.

No thank you, go train some other people.Well redacted collection of mental challenges and puzzles, organized as mental fitness program. But almost immediately they try to hook you on a subscription (ugh) or you can choose to fork over $99.

Thanks for the fun, tho.So I saw ads for this app on Instagram. They often showed a little deductive reasoning riddle (such as a who killed someone based off the evidence they show on screen). I downloaded it thinking that some of the games would be like them. In fact none of the games are like that. However if you are looking for small little challenges to keep your wits sharp it’s not a bad app.Enjoying the challenges one week after downloading, but has been crashing more often last two days.
Otherwise, the free version offers just enough variety of games and goals to be engaging.
Needs at least one update to address crashing.I like this app a lot. I like the challenges and different skill levels.

I think it surpasses all the other “brain training” apps by miles! I do have subscriptions to Luminosity as well as Elevate. But Peak is the only app that has kept my attention. It has a great assortment of games to train things like memory, mental agility, focus, problem solving, emotion, coordination, and my personal favorite language. Peak’s games are diversified and so much fun to play. I can spend hours training. I love playing the different challenges to raise my peak brain score! If iTunes would let me I'd give them 10 stars!! If you're looking into purchasing a brain training app this is definitely the one to get! Pro is worthy every penny!!!!As a new mom and quitting my job to be a stay at home mom I felt like I became dumb. My brain seriously was in survival mode! Once my child turned 2 I was searching for something to stimulate my brain differently on a daily basis and I came upon this app. I tried it for a month without the subscription. And then paid after feeling a difference. I’m in my 3rd month and I feel sharper and smarter and look forward to the challenges of the different types of games! Thank you for this app! I still have mommy brain at moments but I feel so much better than I did before!Edited to say that I’m in Month 10 of my pro subscription and I still play consistently. I really enjoy the challenges and love watching my progress. Still having trouble with British/American English differences stumping me. (E.g. in word alike, it took a few minutes to remember that torch is flashlight not blaze in BE. 

The other fantastic thing for those who travel a lot is that you don’t need WiFi to play. It’s a big help on flights to be able to play in airplane mode. 

I’m definitely renewing my subscription in a few months.I am 76 y.o., post 5 strokes and post Covid 19! So as you can see I have challenges physically, mentally and emotionally. Peak has helped me so much, once I was able to remember that I had it on my iPad! That was a good day even tho I saw a much lower Peak brain score than previous. I track improvement and can see actual evidence of new neuropathways being created. I am hugely encouraged. The brain is amazing! Thank you Peak! Now if I could only get this excited about my physical exercises.Totally enjoy these games and the increasing challenges they present as you work to improve your brain. I don’t like to spend any money on app upgrades but happily spent the low cost in this one to open some more options. I mean we spend more on a dinner out, but this lasts a whole year! I find that as I watch my stats I can even tell when I have not been feeling well due to a sag in scores. I highly recommend this app if you truly want to refine some cognitive skills.I ‘play’ my Peak workout everyday and then some more games I like the best. I enjoy it and I can feel the brain power developing. So many games to choose from in the full version but even the free was a delight for me. I’m over 70 and believe me it is a part of my busy day as a missionary school teacher in Nepal
Still playing, still enjoying, it has so many challenges it stays new!I've tried a number of popular brain training apps. By far Peak is the best. The games change up daily based on my progress. The scoring of challenges is graphed out comparing me with others my age. I consider Peak one of my must do daily health routines. Highly recommend. Just finished my 366 day streak of playing!If it was FREE- there wouldn’t have been ANY negative reviews!!

To the Developers:
Exceptionally well done! Bravo!!!A great set of Brain Games! Constantly evolving to offer new challenges. I like that you can track your progress , the different levels and the individual challenges as well. I wish the instruction for some of the challenges were a bit clearer, but after a play or two you figure it outAlthough “Peak” steadily — at times frustratingly — challenges my quite damaged brain (via a life-altering C19 battle in late Fall, 2020), it’s that very fact which I appreciate, and am so grateful for. “Peak” does not lower its standards, nor expectations, at any point. Those standards give me hope.Peak challenges every practical ability that one can have.  It provides an excellent means to develop latent abilities and sharpen skills now in use.  

I strongly recommend this unique game in which one can do alone, family or groups.I’ve been playing Peak for several years, and love it. The games are fun, and it really helps with muscle memory.

I would love to see some new challenges added. What is the plan for releasing new games?I absolutely love this app! In fact I loved it so much I upgraded to the monthly subscription. I genuinely enjoy the mental exercise of this app as well as the array of challenges it presents. I work in Emergency Medicine and it helps me maintain my mental dexterity between emergencies and at home while I’m stagnant.I like the variety games and the challenges they present. I really appreciate the feedback at the end of the games that show how I’ve progressed or digressed and where I fit regarding the population of people who utilize these games.Peak is the most fun and mind boggling game ever and what I love most is that you get to do different types of mind challenges but the thing is it just feels like you’re playing a game and not working out your mind.I enjoy playing daily, trying to beat my own high scores and records, and to meet new goals and challenges.I really enjoy this app.  The games make me think through different problems and concepts, and it's nice to exercise my brain in a different way from my usual challenges.I love doing the challenges where it says I did better than 99% of people in my rank. It helps me gain confidence in myself, because I honestly think I’m an idiot.This app is quite truly great! It always challenges my brain in so many different ways and I love it!

I completed a “workout” that consisted of 3 games. I got my highest score ever in 2 of them (both in the same category) and my overall score dropped 2 points in that category. This happens every time I get a slight rise in my score. I have to figure it’s because they don’t have a higher level” and this no way for me to progress, so they artificially drop me down,  but there’s no way to reach out to customer service to check. My subscription expires this month and I won’t renew unless it’s fixed or I get a responseHaving participated in daily exercises through Peak, Elevate, and Luminosity, Peak is best overall. It’s categories for training make it highly engaging and have made progress noticeable. 

The only thing that isn’t clear is that Peak score gives inconsistent points - for example, on a day with no games on ‘focus’, I’ve noticed I get negative points, which seems odd? On a similar note, my Peak score progress is really skewed because it doesn’t give me any chance to play games for ‘coordination’ and ‘language’. I’m guessing it’s because I haven’t purchased Pro.

The major issue with Peak is the abundance of ads. After reaching a certain milestone/duration with the app, it triggers ads after every game that last anywhere from 5-60 seconds each. If you want to replay, same thing. 

And after having the app for about a month of play I’ve been getting it before and after games. I don’t value the game enough to buy it, but if you’re willing to pay this game would be worth not having ads.Added new games a year ago that still don’t count toward points.   You have a couple bad games and your points slide.  There should be a practice mode for games to get used to. I play on phone and some games are harder than on computer.

(GAME TRICK: if you have a bad round pause and restart before the game is over and you don't have to watch an ad!) I liked playing the games so I decided I'd pay so I could play more. The paid games really aren't that fun or feel like I'm fine tuning any skills. One of the games is like playing asteroid (while fun, kind of mindless and defeats the purpose of the app). Also, as soon as I paid for it (2.92 a month, not that big of a deal) my scores seemed to drastically drop - lost almost 100 points on my peak brain score and dropped down 10% on the percentile. Thought I was doing great, now kind of feel like an idiot (in more ways than one).The concept of Peak is a good one but it is executed poorly, in my opinion.

The main issues I have with it are:

- Games: Some of the games are poorly explained. For example, because of the tutorial video, I played a Language game under the impression I could only make 3-letter words, resulting in a very low score. You are also not informed that the games increase in difficulty when you rank up, or how the game changes once you do.

- Scores: Maybe I’m just salty (?) but I have a 14 day streak and my scores are incredibly low... I think? You are not told if you want high numbers or lower but I’m assuming higher is what you should aim for. I don’t consider myself a genius but I believe my mental abilities are at least average and yet my brain map never even comes close to that of my age group’s. My Peak brain score has never cracked 300 (and it appears to be out of 1,000) and  additionally, at the end of each workout, I sometimes lose points in categories I never played a game in on that day. The issue is that nothing is explained: why did I lose or gain XXX points? What does my brain map and Peak brain score mean? What is good, what is bad, and how can I improve?5.32.0 - this version doesn’t give me the option to replay a game all the time like the previous versions. Seems like this is a bug because the screen goes white with just the score, not stats given, app hangs, must restart app and no option to replay the last game. Some days it doesn’t even tell me my score for the day. Yesterday it gave me -11 points for emotion, but none of my games that day were from the emotion category. Clearly not enough testing before this release. Wish I could revert.Many of the games’ scores rely on luck or a particular perspective (e.g. any of the word association games depend on the user associating the same set of words, or the blimp spelling game relying on spawning usable letters). Also, despite blowing past the target scores you can still lose points if you have an off day - *plus* it’s highly disproportionate. I might double the target score, but if it’s 5% lower than yesterday I’ll still lose 10 points off my category score.

I can’t attach a screen caps, but I just got three new high scores and two rank ups for a grand total of +9 across four categories. 

Yesterday I lost 10 points in one category for scoring about 15% lower on one game (out of three I played in the category) than I did previously. 

It’s nonsensical.Peak was great until my score dropped 40 points every time they have me play a new game even though the instructions specifically say new games won’t drop your score. I was at 670 now 602 because I’m forced to play new games. I love the new games but not when they drop my score and not when I never see that game again to potentially increase my score.I like the mental challenges of this game but because it’s constantly comparing you with others performances, it’s a little depressing and the fact that it takes away accomplishments in the form of points plus and minus that are visible is also not inspiring.",0,"Don't pay for itGood Concept but needs better ExecutionBuggy version on otherwise great appFine, but not greatScore change with new gamesA little depressing",jessracSupercalifragalisticexp.......Bonfiam[septimus]Fun but way too slowTagni 2,"{'id': 34941199, 'body': 'Hi Bonfiam!

However, my only complaint about this app (so far) is that it does not have enough information. For example, on the game called Grow you're supposed to create as many words as possible out of just a few letters, the bigger the better. One of my groups of letters was ""mas"" so immediately the biggest word I could think of was Massachusetts. Awesome for points right? No. The game kept telling me it wasn't a word, so I wasted time spelling it differently thinking I might be spelling it wrong, which caused me to get a low score. I spelled it correctly. I checked. It's frustrating because I cant replay the game (without paying) and I really do want to know my progress. This issue occurred with more than just this word. How can I learn when the game might not be as knowledgeable about certain things as I am?This would be 5 stars if:
-there was more randomization of the games, it feels like I play the same 5 or 6 all the time.
- they changed the word “multiplier” to “bonus.” Multipliers multiply things and they aren’t multiplying anything, but they are adding bonus points.
-my biggest wish is for us to be able to create our own daily workouts that count toward our streaks. As it is I could play 7 games of my choosing and they don’t count towards my streak. 
- allow us to pause our streaks if we need to. I have a chronic illness so some days I physically cannot play, and it is demoralizing to see a multi-month streak wiped out because I was in the hospital. 
- add other stats like days played since start, days played out of the last 100/ month/week etc. 
- make the robot on the Connect Em’ Up game less of a jerk. We know we lost, he doesn’t need to be a jerk about it. 
I’ve been using Peak for more than a year and it is overall a great product. I obviously think very highly of it, and would be a raving fan if the wishes above were granted.My daughter, husband and I have subscribed to this for almost two years now. It would be really nice if you could just play games just to improve or for fun but this is not an option. Also sometimes the results bear no resemblance to the performance, you can lose several points or gain several points for no apparent reason. I’ve lost points in areas when there were no games in that area on a particular day. Today I lost in three areas where I really was as good as normal. Yep frustrating ……Ok I’m not claiming, or pretending to be a genius, but I can hold my own and have scored fairly high I all the tests I’ve been subjected to when I enlisted in the U. S. Army back in 1973. Plus I’ve been told I scored fairly high in the battery of test to find my IQ, back in my younger days, that told my parents and I that I was a few points above average, so I’m not a dummy by any stretch of the imagination. I don’t know what the science is behind these games/tests, but I have to be honest, I thought I would do better. But maybe that’s a key, the more you do the more challenging it will get, but also easier over time.Overall, I love this app.  My only complaint is that when it throws new games at you (which you inevitably start at a beginner level), your overall performance rating is severely degraded by the inclusion of the new, low (i.e., beginner) scores.  My overall rating dropped 4 percentage points in the last 2 days because I got 3 first-time games (not the same ones) on consecutive days.  Their ranking algorithm should factor that in and not punish the user for things outside their control (i.e., being given new games).like others, totally addicted to app, esp. the language games. However the math doesnt work on some of their games. I perform better than 99% better than all other players, only 10% make it to my current level, and yet I am not even close to the points required to level up. If you perform too well, several coordination and agility games become  impossible to level up on. But again, totally addicted, great for passing time in waiting rooms and while travelling.I’m content with the free version for now but I’d recommend buying the upgrade as you would have more games to play.

There’s a noticeable difference of points between playing any of the games in the morning versus later at night.

I like the amount of information the app gives depending on your scores for the various games.I enjoy the training and the competition with a couple friends. BUT it is hard to understand how they can “dock”points on your daily score from categories that they didn’t test that day. It makes the “scoring” overall suspect. So, depending on why you are interested in this app is whether or not that will bother you.I love these games and wanted full access so I signed up for the subscription.

I am a little skeptical of the rankings, but perhaps I’m overthinking it.

The games for the most part are intuitive, however they have finer points to them and it’s not always clear how to play or what the main focus is. For the game Grow I am still unclear if I need to order my words from shortest to longest to maximize my score 🤷‍♀️

I have been looking for “games” to increase my overall mental skills and while there are many, I love how this one provides you with such a variety. The games are motivating and fun, and I LOVE that you get instant feedback to your rating and how your performance measures up against other. Watching my progress and tracking over time is really neat to see as well. Thanks for the awesome app guys. Keep up the great work!I've enjoyed this game for over two years now and the one thing I’ve learned is that you need to play on a continuous basis. If you stop playing for any length of time you will find that your mental acuity will start diminishing. 

One of the things I fear the most as I grow older is the inability to think clearly and communicate with friends and family clearly and concisely.  This “game” seem to help me continue an active viable mental abilities. Well at the least it gives me reason to think I’m able to still be an active member in societyIf it was FREE- there wouldn’t have been ANY negative reviews!!

Truly! 

The rating system here is completely  out of whack! 
Not free?      Bam 💥- 1 star!
Can’t open? Bam 💥-1 star!
What is it???

I am glad it is not free!

 A Premium App  like this MUST compensate its creators for the continuous updates, seamlessly beautiful interface, and a superior content !

Look! It’s not going to make a genius of Einstein out of you! But, it will tickle your brain, make you smile and entertained! 

The  App Customer Support responds to all messages immediately! Try communicating your challenges to them before “jumping the gun” of the negative reviews!

To the Developers:
Exceptionally well done! Bravo!!!Great app, lots of fun, the games are increasingly challenging, definitely a great download! It’s a bit expensive, but as I was informed by the developer, they are continuously updating every aspect of the service so the prices do make a bit more sense than not. Great way to start the day, get that brain juice a’flowin!Simple interface. Entertaining games that really do workout your mind until it sweats! Great data and feedback as well as motivation from your coach. 

Would be perfect if it had Sherlock style games like Deduction, Mindfulness and a training plan just to get the mind on the Sherlock path. 

Thanks!Love the constant feedback about my score vs. my previous personal best—also love the benchmarking insights vs. other users. Winning requires a growing fertile brain! This is a great way for me to “play a game” on my phone and still feel I’m learning and growing as a human being.I like the variety games and the challenges they present. I really appreciate the feedback at the end of the games that show how I’ve progressed or digressed and where I fit regarding the population of people who utilize these games.Fabulous addictive app!

Luckily no major after effects but my brain was sludgy and making mental connections was hard. I subscribed to Peak shortly after and could immediately feel that it was different from the other brain game apps. With other games I feel like I am improving at *that game* whereas with Peak games I can see real-world benefits. It was especially useful being able to see the graph with my progress, and how I compared to other people in their 40s and 50s. It was very reassuring in a very freaky situation. 

I told my neurologist about Peak and he jotted down the name. Hopefully he will recommend it to his other stroke patients. It really helps.I LOVE the new update!!! It’s amazing. This app has helped me in soooo many ways. It makes me feel as if my entire time using my phone isn’t just wasting time on social media. This game has all of the scientific backing to prove WHY these games work. It’s just all around A M A Z I N G. I play it daily. I currently have a 330 day streak! I’m a college student, and I have found this app helpful in improving my cognition, memory, emotional ability, every aspect! Thank you Researchers for this amazing app. It is free for a workout, AND you can Watch a short 15 second video to play any game you want!I don’t think they are improving my brain but fun little games to play that work well and aren’t too hard, better than wasting time in social media. I paid for the year and enjoy the extra games and being able to play more times, the free version gives you an awesome overview of what you will get if you pay, I used that for a month and it was still pretty good esp for free!I love this app. Especially since I have been trying to avoid other social media applications which don’t stimulate me. This is an amazing way to feel engaged and keep yourself progressing with your mental and emotional agility. I recommend it to all my friend.

Literally. Before playing, while playing, and even after you’re done you’re going to see a 30-second full screen ad. I have nothing against ads, but when you pass more time seeing ads than playing, there is something wrong with the app. Also I didn’t mention that’s the only app that makes your overall score go down after making the perfect score in a game, why? Because when they introduce new games to you, you’re a beginner in that game, so no matter how well you play this game, your overall score will go down the first time you play new games, to make sure you keep wasting your time on this app and don’t reach the perfect score. Oh and I forgot, if you don’t pay the monthly subscription, some games won’t be available anymore, that means you’re gonna keep your bad score for ever and there’s nothing you can do about it, to make sure you won’t finish the game without paying. Everything in this app is about ads, making you pay and keeping you playing by making sure you’ll never reach the perfect score. Doesn’t worth paying either since their games are not even working, the vocabulary games are limited to their vocabulary, the sorting cards game doesn’t even alert you before switching sides, if you’re too fast the game say you’re wrong even when you’re not. Bottom of the line: great concept, badly developed, don’t waste your time.This app can be a good idea but there are many flaws. I understand why the point of having ads is important to have a game and it gives you a reason to buy the premium then and also ads=money but my problem lies with the constant ads like after every game another ad! Like calm yourself I’m not going to pay $35 a year just to probably delete the app in a month anyway. Also why do I have to buy the premium to replay a game once. I understand if u want to play the same game twice so you can’t constantly spam to get a higher score. Also one day by accident I held the play button and all my games were completed for me and my score decreased by 25%. Like I this is when I got like 3 weeks into the game and my scores were fairly high so I stopped playing the game for 2 weeks because of it then I recently got back into the game and i was mostly annoyed because I knew i couldn’t get it back anymore because I needed to spam play which I can’t obviously do because I have to pay for the premium. And you may be like then just buy the premium but $35 is a lot for a person who can’t get a job. Also it’s a mobile game which they are only addicting for about a month or so and they get boring.It is set up so there is a daily quiz. There is a set time of 30 seconds or so for each question and then it just ends, so if you have a streak going it’s broken and if your struggling you’ll never figure it out. You can’t go on the app and focus on the areas and problem you struggle with you can only do the set daily quiz. It doesn’t allow you to personalize it so that you can focus on what you struggle with. It might be that you’re not bad with that area of skill but the way that question is designed like you need to color in blocks in a certain manor but they use three or four shades of the same color so because it’s all a matter of shades you take longer double checking the shades to make sure it’s marked correctly than if they would have used different colors vs shades, that makes you struggle but just like a standardized test it’s one size fits all test. The “statistics” they give you about the capability of the “average” mind in an age group is a complete lie. I’ve talked to teachers and psychologists and neurologists and they all say that nobody, absolutely nobody has a perfect balance of medium skill level in all subjects. Everyone does better in some and worse in others by comparison.Don’t fall for it. The free trial will auto renew at a YEARLY membership of $35!!! That’s outrageous. Then the company will point you to Apple and say there is nothing they can do and Apple will point back to the company and shrug their shoulders. It’s a predatory business practice to scam money from people and hope they don’t notice. I almost enjoyed the games enough to consider another month but I wouldn’t willingly pay 35 for five of these apps. And the rankings and scores don’t even feel legit. There is no real information about how they score or why you are ranked a certain way. Overall this is just a big waste of money. They should just call it a game app and stop lying to people. Shame on Apple and this developer for setting up their free trial this way.  If you get enough Complaints that you need to put it in your FAQ you’re probably doing something wrong.Went from zero days issue to now after each game it mostly goes to a black screen never to return again. I need to close app and restart it again. How disappointing. In addition I’ve been getting some high scores but overall rating continues to go down. Old games now showing up again.  Using latest iOS on iPhone 13. Seems like problems continue. 

Why does this app do this? Doing the normal daily routine, complete it but later in Day funky things happen and seems like some link was broke. Is this running on AWS by any chance? My data for Tuesday of this week was there and completed and now again lost all those days so I’m back to zero. Not the first time this has happened and I expect not the last. So disappointing.I am trying out Luminosity, Elevate, and Peak. Park was definitely the first one I UNINSTALLED  because of the terrible annoying video ads for other apps. You have to wait them out, they are pixelated, and my particular ad showed an elderly woman holding her head because of her ""mental age"" score being low.  The ad itself had a very small (x) at the end, and all in all, it felt like it was fishing for someone to accidentally click on it. The games weren't that great, and they seemed like Luminosity rip offs. (FWIW, Elevate is my favorite so far as the games are focused more on math, spelling, writing, and reading - and in general, they feel more useful than the abstract games of Luminosity and Peak.)Started playing, was enjoying it when I noticed the numbers were a bit weird in the results/comparisons section. You can get the same or different scores and get different or the same results, respectively. The numbers have to be made up, and even the “streaks” in games were off. I counted, and once it said 20 when I made sure to make a mistake after 10 in an agility game. The percentage comparison with other people must be randomized, because after playing the same game several times I saw the percentage go up and down willy nilly, despite me obviously doing better or worse in all areas. Not sure why the ratings are so high, maybe people just don’t bother to look at the stats.I paid for a full year of Peak and now, having played for a month or so, I’m not sure I’ll bother continuing with it. The wide variety of games is impressive at first, but most are minor variations of the same idea. There are four or five versions of the Stroop color word test, a handful of word games, and then some clones of other common mobile puzzle games like Flappy Bird and Picross. With many of the games, I couldn’t tell what was being tested or challenged - many are simply tedious or poorly laid out, so the challenge is dealing with the UI. There is no info in the app explaining exactly what is being tested with each game, and the only metric of personal growth is their “Peak IQ” scoreThis app is trying to get you to buy their premium version of the app. The overall brain score it gives you for is really low on purpose. You could be in the top 95% in every game, but your overall score will only be around 300. The only way to make this score higher is by playing the games more times so you improve at that game. That’s where the problem occurs. If you pay for their premium membership, you have unlimited access to all the games and can play them until you master them. This app isn’t making you smarter, it’s making you better at pointless mini games and puzzles, but telling you it’s improving several vague categories of brain activity.I don’t like being told how poorly I’m doing compared to others. I’m recovering from a concussion and was told this app would be helpful. It’s not. I would like to be compared only to my previous scores to look for improvement. Being compared to the “child prodigy's” (from an earlier review) doesn’t help my self esteem, which has already taken a hit. Nor does this app seem to be helping me. If you’re already in Mensa and want to feel even more smug about how smart you are, you’ll enjoy this app. If you’re fighting your way back from traumatic brain injury, this app will only make you feel worse.Do yourself a favor and don’t get sucked into this game. I started playing a few months ago I had 130 day playing streak and then I missed a day and now I’m on an 80 day streak. The game is rigged so that no matter how well you do on each game it will find ways to deduct points until you subscribe and then you’ll be a superstar for doing the exact same thing. Such a scam, and it’s so not affordable! Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this horrible app! These sad people are only money hungry and are trying to convince you that you are stupid unless you pay. Literally.I used to play Peak when it had started. It was a fun game that I would compete with my dad and brother in, to see who could get the highest score on games. Back when it first came out, it didn’t have nearly the amount of ads it does now, if it even had any. But now, trying to play the game for free is a nightmare. 
In between games: 10 second ad
Replaying games: 30 second ad
Playing all the games in the daily routine: 30 second ad
Most of the time you’ll be watching ads more than you’re actually playing the game. It’s just a sad shell of what it used to be.At the end of the day it’s a money grab and the logic behind it doesn’t make any sense. Like today I played a focus game called unique and it said I scored above 98 percent then I finish my “workout” and it said my focus rating went down I can’t see if that’s possible when I did better than most people and the brain mapping can’t be right either because in most little game so score well above 80 percent then I go to the summary and it says you are 62% above your group then if you go to the brain mapping it shows mine much smaller than my age group it doesn’t all coordinate... I guess it’s fun but you won’t actually gain anythingNew update now slaps an ad in between each training game, rather than just having to watch ads to play more than the first two Super intrusive and annoying, I liked watching a couple to unlock more but now I don't even want to open the app

Update to dev response:
 Cop out answer. They're not short video ads they are intrusive long ads. Longer than the games between the ads, not to mention the extra banners thrown on top of the ads to block the timers/force you to go to their store page to get you more clicks

There are ways to improve the customer experience so they WANT to support you, rather than choke people until they're forced to either purchase or uninstall, I'd still be building my streak on a daily basis if it wasn't for those ads, getting me closer and closer to buying in to spend more time training, now it's just an uninstalled forgotten appPeak certainly provides hours of mindless fun, but its contention that using it actually improves cognitive performance are suspect.  As a clinician, I have yet to see that using programs like PEAK improves cognitive performance demonstrated in a double-blinded study.  Until that happens, this will be nothing more than what it is: something to occupy idle hands on long flights.  

Furthermore, how it assigns ‘improvements’ in any of the cognitive domains seems decidedly unidimensional - how can one play ANY of these games without improving one’s scores on at least two (and possibly three) metrics, particularly when all of the games are timed?The issue was fixed after my last review and worked for a day or two. Now it just had a loading circle on the main page and games won’t load. 

 I love this game and plan on buying the full version when the next sale comes along. 
BUT, since the last update it does nothing but crash. Over and over. Sometimes I can make it work for a game if I turn off my iPad and turn it back on again. Once I leave the app, it will just crash again as soon as I try to start the app again. 
I have contacted customer service but just got some canned response that has nothing to do with what I (and many others) are experiencing. 
I have lost my daily streak and am truly sad about that. 
Please fix this ASAP and not wait until the weekly or bi weekly update for the app.I really enjoy this app, but I will never tolerate something that makes me feel scammed out of my time. My time being made to watch ads in order to play a game I enjoy, then denying to allow me to play said game. I literally watched 2 ads, one to exit out of a game and post my score, then went back to replay the game, watched another ad, then got denied to play after watching another ad. One star for wasting my time instead of being up front about it and just denying me before wasting my time.Many of the games are fun to play when they come up in rotation. Pay no attention to that score because half the word games are testing how well you can text rather than any other skill. What really disappoints me is recent developments that have limited the access to games without watching extended commercials. While the games are fun, this is a company that couldn’t care less about its customers. Monthly cost is close to premium movie channel.I’ve been playing this game for a while and am a tester for it. I like the variety of games but it is frustrating to do really well and have no change to overall score and then do slightly less well and overall score goes down. The algorithms seem very skewed towards negative performance. There are quite a few glitches also which have been around for a long time with no fix. Overall I enjoy it but wish these things would get addressed.So, I’ve been paying for this service for years.  I put up with being harassed for reviews.  I put up with be constantly coerced to do what *they* wanted me to do. 

I was a Grand Master at some games.  A Legend for years at another.  I constantly scored at the 99th and 100th percentile.  

I logged in today and was told that I was close to leveling up.  At the game that I’ve been a Legend at for years.   I threw the app away and relaunched.  Three times.  Same result.  I restarted the phone and relaunched the app.  Same result. 

Bye.  

If you can’t do something as simple as keeping score, what else can’t you do?   I don’t want to know.  And I’m not paying you for the privilege.  

From a business perspective, you’re morons.I fully understand the need for ads and I don’t mind them if it means I can continue to play for free. (That’s my budget right now.) The problem is when the ad pops up before the end of the game. Of the three free games today it happened twice, and the second time I had to shut down the app and restart it to get to the third game. I wonder what my score would be if I could actually play to the end?I’ve been a user on and off for about 3 years, and at one point I was using it every day.

I came back today and honestly, this app is nothing like it used to be, and is borderline unplayable now. 

More and more features have been taken away to be pro exclusive, the app has never really adjusted it’s scoring system to recognize really good scores as opposed to slightly off ones, and now there is more ads than ever before.

If you’re looking for a brain training app and you’re willing to drop money on a subscription to play connect four for five minutes a day, be my guest. But if you’re here to even attempt the free trial version, just don’t bother.Paid for subscription based upon my poor initial assessment performance. Pro Games are good. But I realized when I took the initial test I was tired so maybe I didn’t score well. I signed out and created a new account. I destroyed all the assessment games and was in above 95 percentile for all of them, but again, they scored me poorly in a few areas. Total ripoff and feel cheated. But maybe that was the real test of my intelligence and I failed since I bought a subscriptionThis game makes it a really big deal to compare you to other users. The app praises you for high scores and kinda brings you down for low scores. You don't get to play any of the fun games they show in their advertisements that actually require evaluation and thought. Most of the games are timed and increase in difficulty the longer you play. It's just not what they make it out to be. I will be deleting app.This is just a trick to force you to spend money. After taking the prognosis test, I was told on the memory test the average score is 67% where I got 100%. It then gave me a really low percentile for my brain map. As someone who qualifies for Mensa, I know I am not only in the 58th percentile, so I know my current brainmap from the app was just a marketing tool to try and get me to pay the exorbitant subscription cost. Don’t fall for it.Don’t know who is writing the other reviews—bots?  I see no impact from this other than the wasting of my time. Score progression is opaque. Games are not fun. I see no real improvement. But worst of all are the horribly stupid ads. That alone would erase any improvement you might have seen (if that’s even possible given the silliness of the “games”). This is just an ad machine. I’m deleting this.WTH is up with the 30 second ads after every single game? It’s really distracting and disappointing that you guys would do this to your free users. I’d understand one ad before starting the session and one after, but after every single game? Come on! And now you can’t see your score until after you watch an ad. This app is becoming unusable.I enjoyed this app very much until it stopped recording my progress and updating my scores. I know this should not be happening and have contacted the developers twice already with no response. I’ve basically paid for a year subscription on a now utterly useless app with zero customer support. Lovely. 

Don’t risk your money on this app, if it breaks you have no recourse.I like the premise of the game, but they're just trying to sell you on their paid version.

Furthermore, at least one of the games (the one with the faces) scores half of your correct answers as incorrect for some reason (""Is the man wearing glasses?"" He is not, and you select ""No"", and get scored as an incorrect answer) .

Very frustrating. Needs improvement. Could be a fun activity.Thought I loved this app, spent money finally for pro and all my scores dropped instantly.

Since I haven’t heard back from anyone, I’d like a refund and my scores to be returned to what they were. It took me 9 months to get my score above 800 and it dropped like a rock because I bought pro...Please fix the bugs in the latest version!! After you play a game and it’s showing the score, there’s no way to continue on to the next game or to a different game.

Forced to Exit out of the app and restart. I’ve stopped playing and only playing Luminosity now.I can't believe the devs. If you want to complete your daily streak you have to watch an ad. If you want to see your stats you have to watch an ad. If you want to replay a game you have to watch an ad! And it has ads even between games.

The issue I have with it is you only play 5 games a day, and sometimes I forget what the purpose of the game is and it takes a couple seconds to figure out what you are supposed to do. When you play everyday you are more likely to remember the object of the games and therefore you score higher because you are prepared for how to play, not because you are improving your brain function but simply because you know what to do when the game starts. They offer tutorials before the game but I often forget to click on them and there were a couple that even after watching I didn’t fully get. 

I’m an engineer, I fancy myself to be above average intelligence, but it’s certainly not because of this app. I deleted the app today seeing little to no value. I would have kept it but the ads in between each of the mini games take as long as the game itself almost. I get you need ads, but do one before you start playing and one after, not one in between each mini game (there are 5).I’ve used this app for years and generally like it. My main complaint is the system that requires you to get an overall score before you can unlock new levels for games. It’s entirely possible for one area of focus to keep you from progressing in others which is extremely frustrating. I understand why this choice was made, but unless you add more content to all areas, you will reach a plateau and you won’t progress further, locking things you enjoy behind walls you can’t remove. Please either add games to all areas of focus, not just a few, so there is a better chance to raise the overall score or change that overall score as being what unlocks new challenges in each area to each area unlocks the more you progress. And no, it’s not a case of try harder. When I’ve spent hours attempting to better my score and I’ve reached a peak performance and I have limited choices in raising that score, it’s no longer only holding myself back, but the app design. I suppose a third option of lowering what’s required to unlock new content is also a tweak than a design change would also work.

I feel like I’ve paid for way more than I’m getting and that’s disappointing.pro user. After spending a good bit of money I got pro. And while I LOVE IT I hate the issues with certain games. 
Jump- I don’t know if it’s an iPhone sensitivities thing... but I can’t get it to work at all. even my partner tried. He can’t do it either. I end up with a 0 score. And as you only have two games for coordination, when one doesn’t work, you only have one other to play so my overall coordination score is very low. Certain memory ones don’t work correctly as well.. 
spin cycle. 4 yellow blocks rotating clockwise 
“ the color has changed” - false.. and it marks it as incorrect!! I get that it’s a learning brain teaser game, but when it doesn’t work correctly it can be extremely frustrating.  I would love to keep using this app, and even renew my pro subscription again next year. But with out addressing the bugs and problems. I feel like you can only play certain games- and therefore only reach a certain level of achievement.I love this app, don’t get me wrong. Recently the peak brain score is immensely flawed. Today I was introduced to three new games: baggage claim, face to face, and memory sweep. Baggage claim and memory sweep are in the memory category and face to face is in the emotion category. The other game was for mental agility. For all of the news games I scored within the 100% percentile or around there. One can say I did good. Yet, for today’s summary, emotion went down 35% and memory went down 7%. The peak brain score specifically says that it does not calculate new games yet those two categories (both which involved new games) went down significantly and ruined my streak of a growing peak score. There was no other games played besides the 3 new games and the mental agility game. So I do not understand why my categories went down so significantly if 1. these were new games and 2. I had excellent score on my first try. 

Please fix this issue. It ruins the experience of new games.I love this app and I’ve been using it for a quite a while already. I like how it helps me in certain areas of my daily life. But there’s a minor problem, and that is that once I achieved Graduate level in some of the games, I was introduced to new games, which makes sense because you can’t stay stuck on the same things. But the problem is that my Peak score performance went down (by a lot) while just trying for the first time these new games. This is not fair at all because it seems like I’m doing terribly while working out my brain, which is not true at all. I wish this was changed, so for the first time you try a new game (because you’ve leveled up), your performance actually keeps constant, without affecting your overall Peak score performance. Please, fix this!I spent one month being Pro. When I downloaded this app, there were only one time (no replay) three games(unlike in Lumosity where you can replay day games thousands of times). I got intrigued, so I bought a subscription. But it felt forced and after a week I knew I wouldn’t be returning to pro.
What’s the problem with games? They get too repetitive and too addictive. Constant comparison to self AND others is demotivating. Streak quickly turns into a chore.

And then my Pro ended. I couldn’t finish even daily workout because advertisements were too annoying - you cannot even restart JUST started game without having to watch 10 seconds video. Deleting app and never coming back. There’re better options on market.I haven’t purchased yet.  The games start before I know or remember how to play.  So then I have to stop the games for the instructions.  Then I restart but am required to watch long video ads first.  I got frustrated and gave up because this isn’t fair.  I don’t want to purchase until I’ve evaluated it but don’t have the patience to sit through all the long ads.  I understand if I wanted to re-take the tests because I didn’t like my score, but I just want instructions and I pause as soon as the games start.  Either give us the options to see the instructions first or don’t make people who stop within one or two seconds watch videos in order to play the games.Games only change when you move up a level. However, the scoring doesn’t work once you reach a certain score. I completed a “workout” that consisted of 3 games. I got my highest score ever in 2 of them (both in the same category) and my overall score dropped 2 points in that category. This happens every time I get a slight rise in my score. I have to figure it’s because they don’t have a higher level” and this no way for me to progress, so they artificially drop me down,  but there’s no way to reach out to customer service to check. My subscription expires this month and I won’t renew unless it’s fixed or I get a responseI found this app from an ad and it looked fun so I got it. The introduction is really clear and the first brain ‘workout’ you do is cool. Then after I finished that I thought it was cool that you could compare your scores to other of your age, profession etc. But then I looked around the app wanting more and lo and behold I couldn’t play any more games without upgrading to monthly subscriptions and paying.... And to make things worse you can only play the first free set of games once a day, I believe... I genuinely thought this was a smart, cool, and fun game but I guess not. Deleting it right now.  Don’t download it if you aren’t willing to pay $2.67 or something like that per month.Having participated in daily exercises through Peak, Elevate, and Luminosity, Peak is best overall. It’s categories for training make it highly engaging and have made progress noticeable. 

The only thing that isn’t clear is that Peak score gives inconsistent points - for example, on a day with no games on ‘focus’, I’ve noticed I get negative points, which seems odd? On a similar note, my Peak score progress is really skewed because it doesn’t give me any chance to play games for ‘coordination’ and ‘language’. I’m guessing it’s because I haven’t purchased Pro.

The major issue with Peak is the abundance of ads. After reaching a certain milestone/duration with the app, it triggers ads after every game that last anywhere from 5-60 seconds each. If you want to replay, same thing. 

And after having the app for about a month of play I’ve been getting it before and after games. I don’t value the game enough to buy it, but if you’re willing to pay this game would be worth not having ads.The app is fun to play and engaging but it can be very frustrating. It is expensive is upgrade to peak pro and so i dont, but because i dont upgrade i am stuck with a randomly selected set of games every day. The worst thing is i get the same games every day, for the past two weeks ive had the stupid wizard game appear in my list and I absolutely hate it. I am getting really tired of this app and am thinking of deleting it. The only thing i like about it is being able to track my score but that, as im told, could not actually reflect how im doing at all, considerig im playing the dame games.I’ve been using this app for a while now and I’ve gotten to levels in the games where you need to replay the game and get a certain score twice in a row to level up. Recently, when pressing the replay button, it asks me to upgrade to the Pro version and will not let me replay. Before, I could watch an ad in order to replay that game.  Financially I can’t upgrade to Pro, and if I am not able to level up my games it’s really going to deter me from playing. 

Otherwise, the app is fun and good. But this is a huge roadblock to my enjoyment of it.It’s a great brain game. And every game I play it says I’m above average. It shows my scores then compares them to averages from other people, and as I stated before it says I’m above average to in the top highs. But then when I check my brain map vs other players it shows that my level is completely lower then any player. Basically shows a map that says I’m a below average dumb minded person. I don’t get it. It shouldn’t tell you that you are above average then show a brain map that says the complete opposite! Not sure what’s going on there but they are messing up statistics somewhere I think!I started on this app only about a month ago and have recently received my “brain map score,” or what ever. I am a smart 13 year old that struggles with words sometimes but it says that I exceed in language but have AWEFUL COORDINATION. I may not be great with my hands but I  can land a perfect handstand and when faced with boredom, I SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY FINDING SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO. I am very left brained and this is not accurate. If we could have the option to get rid of outliers, I would have a higher score because I am not perfect. I will continue to use this app though. Great app though.Like I was saying I thought it would be a fun game to train your brain, but what I didn’t know is that you had to pay money to play the game all the time. This really got me frustrated because I wanted to replay the game and see if I could get a better score, Instead I can’t and they want me to pay money for pro. I really thought this would be the game that did do this because I really liked it. I’m a little sad that it had to come to me deleting the game.I’ve been sampling this app for over 100 days and while playing the ‘Grow’ game I had two letters ‘CH’ that I had to complete a word. I chose “Christmas” and it was an error. I then minimized the game to check my spelling, and when I returned to the game I got a video error. I closed the game and then opened it back up. The error is still there, not allowing me to continue my daily play streak. This game doesn’t teach you to think better. It’s no better than a sudoku game.The games in the app are generally fun and well-designed. One can play 4 games per day on the free version, but I wouldn’t bother getting this app unless you want to pay for the subscription because it no longer lets you see your score for the game you just completed or how it compares with prior scores. Instead, you see an ad and skip the feedback screen. Very frustrating.Like this app ok. Overall it offers a wide variety of games and ability to flip around in different games. But Wish there were a way to turn off the stats completely. It would be interesting to have the option to play just for fun rather than to always have score weighted or factored in to total score. Some of the games are anxiety provoking for Neuro divergent folks.Great mental game set for people who love ads longer than the games you can play.  Even better if you love ads before and right after your game so you have to wait for the ads to finish before you  see your score. Me? I love ads so I’m giving it two stars.  If there weren’t as many ads I might only give it one be the games are so lame and childish.App is good for brain training.  Not updated enough with new games though and they are incapable of keeping track of daily workout streaks.  Mine always resets even though I am doing the workouts.  They say not to do the workout around midnight if you want it to count. Pretty bush league.  Fix that and do more updates.  Until then disappointed I bought itToo many of these games have really inadequate instructions. I got really frustrated and had to google some of them. I thought that was ridiculous, given how clear it became after googling. Why didn’t it just say so in the first place? Honestly I don’t think my brain is improving either. My scores go up and down.7 day streak… get high scores on all games and even do “better than most ppl at your rank” and my overall score goes down. 

Maybe the math really does work out there but man is it discouraging. I like the idea of staying sharp but this app relies on negging to keep you going. 

Super skeptical of this app and its methods.While most of the games are very good, and the sense of progression and improvement is great, some games are simply impossibly to progress and rank up on, no matter how great you do.

I have one complaint though: the progress you see is not entirely accurate. The score you receive is entirely based on the level of difficulty you’re playing at, and you don’t unlock the more difficult levels without having to grind out the beginner stuff. Some of the games at beginner & novice are a cake walk. It’s easy to perform perfectly, but scoring perfectly on a beginner or novice puzzle will sometimes give you a peak score of less than 400. As you unlock the harder levels, you’re able to score higher because that restriction is gone. This falsifies the results a bit, so it’s not reflective of your actual progress. Don’t get me wrong; this app is extremely beneficial, and tons of fun. It could just use one fix.

Developers: if you’re reading this, please remove the restriction on the higher difficulties for new users. It’s pretty boring to breeze through the easy puzzles to get scores that aren’t reflective of one’s mental ability. Not only is it misleading, it may deter new users who don’t feel like grinding out the beginner puzzles. 3/5.Many of the games are fun and do seem to help cognitive growth. Love the tracking and goals. However, some of the games are frustratingly too difficult and one game I just can’t figure out at all though I’ve tried.  They allow you to thumbs up or thumbs down a game but the thumbs down ones show up in your daily exercise plan and you can only change the game once per category so you a lot of times get stuck with another game you don’t want to play after passing on the first one. Minor annoyances though. My biggest frustration is that this is obviously created with Great Britain English vocabulary vs American which is vastly different. Actual American English legitimate words that would win in scrabble aren’t allowed in word games and so many GB English words are referenced that you would have to know their forms of vocabulary to do well in some of the games (words like pram that many Americans don’t know but are in the Word Alike game). Games also are stagnate. Dropping a newer game once in a while would be nice.I’ve had this app for years, going back to it every few months. I enjoy working my brain in little ways, as most people who download this app probably do. But my issue with the game is the ads. It was annoying getting ads after every mini-game but I get it so I continued. The real issue is getting ads in the middle of playing games, not allowing me to finish or seeing my results. Sometimes I can’t even close out of the ads and have to restart the app, but then it starts me at the next game, unless (get this) I watch another ad to retry the previous game. The games are fun even if some of them are luck based and therefore despite being better you get a lower score. The ads actually make it unplayable, the games are timed and when an ad pops up that wont close until 15 seconds have passed while playing a game where every second counts, simply ruins itThis brain game was very good. I enjoyed the games. The last few times I had opened it to play, there have been new games, which, you would think, that’s so great. Changing it up. However, my brain score drops by giant amounts with these new games which is somewhat unfair when you are getting used to a new game & how to play. Today I played the games offered & instead of getting to continue to play games I usually have access to, they were all locked & it said I had to pay if I wanted to play more. I don’t mind the ads & having to wait through them to continue playing. If they think forcing me to buy time to play this game is going to happen, you should think again. Let me play with ads & I will continue to talk up what a great brain game this is, otherwise, I’m done…I do love this app. But I think greed got the best of this app unfortunately. I used to be able to play certain games whenever I wanted. I do the daily workouts and I used to be able to choose which of those daily games sometimes included in the daily workout to play on its own. Not anymore. I have a streak of playing for 32 days in a row and yesterday I was able to play the game I love and today I can’t till I have another streak of 19 days. I understand the need to push for the upgrade but I should be able to play more of the games on their own without having to purchase the pro version. I was literally this close to purchasing it anyways, but this really rubbed me the wrong way. And now I’m researching for other apps that are similar and trying to find a similar game to the one I love in this app. It’s a shame....Two issues. 1.) You really need to allow users to comment on each game and take their feedback. Some games have glitches — for example, a game wherein similar (or opposite) words are to be connected, one round had the same word (not similar, but the exact same word) twice but only one would be considered the right answer paired with another word. I like the app and everything, but it’s frustrating not being able to give feedback on particular games outside of the Apple store review. 2.) It seems to me that the more you play, the better your score is, rather than the better you do, the better your score is. Why does my score go up when my best score was 5-10 games ago? Why does my score do down if I get new high scores on every game I played that day? Puts the validity into question.........I was enjoying the brain training a lot, even though you can only play games once and have to watch a lot of ads to play games that aren't in your daily workout. (GAME TRICK: if you have a bad round pause and restart before the game is over and you don't have to watch an ad!) I liked playing the games so I decided I'd pay so I could play more. The paid games really aren't that fun or feel like I'm fine tuning any skills. One of the games is like playing asteroid (while fun, kind of mindless and defeats the purpose of the app). Also, as soon as I paid for it (2.92 a month, not that big of a deal) my scores seemed to drastically drop - lost almost 100 points on my peak brain score and dropped down 10% on the percentile. Thought I was doing great, now kind of feel like an idiot (in more ways than one).I’m unsure about some of the games. For example, Happy River. It’s supposed to test for Emotion but the result of the game is based-on the difficulty of crossing the River (it’s like Frogger) not necessarily recognizing words representing positive emotion. The same goes for the Must Sort game. It will suddenly swap cards from side to side but not delay the game so you’re punished if a swap occurs close to when you sort. The game should stop, then swap. I’ve also found Tap Trap doesn’t respond to taps when it starts to move fast. Finally, Object Find is weird because the items are drawn more comical than real so you’re almost trying to find a weird interpretation of an item versus the item. Overall if it’s a fun puzzle game. Fun enough I pay for a subscription. But, I wouldn’t put too much stake in the brain score or brain training.The concept of Peak is a good one but it is executed poorly, in my opinion.

The main issues I have with it are:

- Games: Some of the games are poorly explained. For example, because of the tutorial video, I played a Language game under the impression I could only make 3-letter words, resulting in a very low score. You are also not informed that the games increase in difficulty when you rank up, or how the game changes once you do.

- Scores: Maybe I’m just salty (?) but I have a 14 day streak and my scores are incredibly low... I think? You are not told if you want high numbers or lower but I’m assuming higher is what you should aim for. I don’t consider myself a genius but I believe my mental abilities are at least average and yet my brain map never even comes close to that of my age group’s. My Peak brain score has never cracked 300 (and it appears to be out of 1,000) and  additionally, at the end of each workout, I sometimes lose points in categories I never played a game in on that day. The issue is that nothing is explained: why did I lose or gain XXX points? What does my brain map and Peak brain score mean? What is good, what is bad, and how can I improve?Overall I like the app. But I don’t think the games are always designed well to target the area they say it is.

 For example, in the games in the “Emotion” subject I have found the variable that most effects my score is coordination. In the game where you drag the smiling face to another while avoiding hiring the blocks, it is coordination that effects how well I perform. This has nothing to do with emotional intelligence. I would also like to see published research on these games. 

What makes them think that each game actually targets and has performance based on the skill they claim to be training? I understand that some areas are much easier to develop games for, but it is misleading to say it is training a certain area when that is not what determines the score you get.

I think the games are generally better in the other sections like mental agility, focus, math and verbal. But some games have similar issues where the limiting variable (at least for me) has not been my ability in what the game is supposed to train, but another area like coordination in the previously mentioned example.UPDATE: I have been playing this for nearly 6 months and am canceling my subscription. The game is rarely updated and problems are not fixed. Also, brain scores go up rapidly in the first couple months to pull you in, and then slow waaaaaay down. I have better things to do with my money.

I enjoy Peak and look forward to my “brain training” time each day. It is very satisfying to see my score go up every time. If I had a criticism it would be that some of the instructions for individual games can be confusing and some of the games are quite clunky - particularly the word games - so do keep that in mind. But overall it is excellent.These games to an extent reflect an immutable characteristic, intelligence, and so therefore most folks will have ceiling within a game that is well short of the highest levels one can attain. As well, when one plays, they are told how they compare with others of their ‘rank’. Why? I’m imagining someone who although they get a great workout from and otherwise enjoy these games, being told they’re in the lowest quintile of scorers FOR NO REASON other than to make high scorers feel superior for something they are born with smacks of elitism and ableism. Progress should he measured against oneself, and friends is they so wish, not the gen pop of higher than avg IQ individuals who gravitate twd these activitiesI purchased the pro version of the app and everything looks great and I love the games. However, there seems to be a bug where scores aren’t properly recorded or once I complete a game it’s as if I never played it once I go back to it and look at past scores. One of my friends who also has the pro version of the app is also experiencing these bugs. As fun as it is, my actual progress can’t be tracked. I’ve tried reinstalling the app but this doesn’t seem to do much to fix it. There’s bigger potential for the app to be great with tracking progress but this may not be possible in the app’s current state.This game started out pretty cool for me. The free version let me play a little each day on my daily workout. Then, after my second or third day, a lot of games that were included in my workout were LOCKED so I could play no more than three or four  per day. Then the ads came around and told me to watch ads to get free plays. I tried this twice and still the games remained locked. 
Also after a while my scores stopped updating and I was pretty frustrated cause I’d been doing pretty good.
Such a waste tho. These games should be enjoyed by everyone, not just those who want to spend money.I love the games, but there is one in particular that has been malfunctioning & I can find nothing within the app to get support.  

I also don’t get, how I can play the same game over and over,  get one score which tells me, I’m unstoppable, play the same game again within 5 minutes and get told that I’m doing better than a certain percentile with a score that is higher than the one that told me I was in the 100 percentile.

My biggest frustration is not knowing how to get direct answers to my support questions.  I will state again the games are great.5.32.0 - this version doesn’t give me the option to replay a game all the time like the previous versions. Seems like this is a bug because the screen goes white with just the score, not stats given, app hangs, must restart app and no option to replay the last game. Some days it doesn’t even tell me my score for the day. Yesterday it gave me -11 points for emotion, but none of my games that day were from the emotion category. Clearly not enough testing before this release. Wish I could revert.Before the update you would only have to deal with ads if you wanted to replay a game. Now every time you finish a game a 30second ad pops up. The ads are hard to click out of even when you watch it for 30seconds and if you leave the game to go to something else while the ad is plying it freezes and takes forever to get to the next game. I used to really love this game and would do it during my 15min breaks now I can’t because of the ads after everything. I’m very close to uninstalling. My streak has dropped drastically.Most of the games are actually geared towards brain training and such... but some really aren’t. The problem is on object find games when you’re expected to know what the object looks like to find it. If a “drum kit” isn’t a picture of a snare drum, then what is? 
They also have games that discriminate against hearing loss instructing a higher score by listening to the change in sounds. Well, that would mean deaf people aren’t as smart because they can’t hear the sound and react faster?
Frankly, play on the free side. Don’t waste your money on a subscription.Most of the games are interesting, but all the language/vocabulary-based ones are full of errors. They don’t recognize common words, yet allow foreign words, acronyms, and nonsense words.
My latest issue is having my streak broken and put back to 0 days, even though I’ve played every day (and it shows that on my history.) There is no support, and no way to address issues.
Maybe if I paid, I would have access to some support? I won’t pay for an already-problematic app.I purchased the full version when it went on sale, so I have played many of them.  I have found that this is a great app for high school G/T students to hone skills.

There are issues, however.  Some of the categories (like Emotion and Coordination) don’t have many games, so it is tougher to increase your score.  And specifically, Word Pairs is an incredibly inaccurate game; there are many meanings for the words, so pairs that should match up, don’t.  

I would love to see some games based on divergent thinking to help hone creative thinking skills, rather than focusing on convergent thinking (right/wrong questions).

It is also important to remember that these games hone very specific skill sets.  For example, if you score low in Emotion doesn’t mean you aren’t attuned to people’s emotions or are not empathetic.  These games rely mostly on speed and fluency in timed settings.As far as games go, Peak is at least productive. If I had kids, I’d want them to spend time mastering the games in this app. My biggest frustration is with the language games - in Word path, when you have high value words and letters on the board, the game glitches and doesn’t allow you to place new words. You can put letters down but they no longer become recognized as words. It seems to intentionally freeze whenever you have a higher score.I enjoy games such as these, however I am disappointed in the scoring.  If you are truly bettering yourself, it should be recognized.    Sometimes all games are higher than previous and score goes backwards.   You can look at your game and see that the score meets criteria for next level, and then the scores don’t seem to matter.   I do not have the paid app, but if this is reflective, I won’t be getting it either.  
I do however, like the idea of challenging your brain every day!I just down loaded the last update and 2 of today’s games freeze and I have to totally reenter to replay. Also my top favorites are gone from the Today screen. The updates seem to cause more and more problems than fixes

So today 3 more games froze at end on the game score - Must Sort, Rush Back and Tunnel Trance.  Very frustrating and I would lower my rating if I could.   Are you even reviewing the ratings your are asking for???After playing for about two weeks straight, I lost the ability to watch advertisements to replay a game (instead, it prompts you to subscribe for unlimited replays). Since the games require you to attain a certain score twice in a row in order to level up, this means my games will never become more difficult, though my peak brain score may continue to increase. I think I will stop playing now. Fun for the first two weeks!I have been using Peak for a few months and have found it rewarding. A few weeks ago, I began playing Decoder. While playing, I notice that Decoder will sometimes not recognize that I tapped the screen, and then it negatively affects my score. I know I am not tapping too late or too early; it simply occasionally does not register my taps at random times. (It took a bit of trial and error to figure out that it was not my mistake, but rather the software.) I have a new 7th generation iPad.I enjoy passing the time with the various challenges presented by your app. However not sure how reliable your calculated Peak Brain Score could be. I wonder what English language dictionary your Word Fresh challenge uses, it leaves a bit to be desired when a word I find in my dictionary (Merriam-Webster) is not accepted in the game (i.e. - exuberate). There have been other words less recent which I unfortunately no longer recall… with the same result. 
Thanks for the fun, tho.The first 11-12 times I played it were fun. There is a good variety of challenging games. Ads only appeared when I wanted to play a game that was not curated for me that day. However, after about my 12th day playing it straight, ads started appearing before and after each game. That’s at least 10 ads a day if you are keeping your streak up. I get that it’s a free version, but the number of ads was perfect at the beginning. Now I just was to throw the app away and try something else.When I play, problem solving is consistently where I do my best, always above 90th percentile and generally above 95%..however, when I go to look at my scores, it seems to be the worst. By far. It has me in the 9th percentile, as in 9%. I'm not 100% sure the others are accurate either, it seems like they're all over the map. Not sure if anyone else has this problem, but it's pretty annoying as I can't get an accurate read at how I compareMany of the games’ scores rely on luck or a particular perspective (e.g. any of the word association games depend on the user associating the same set of words, or the blimp spelling game relying on spawning usable letters). Also, despite blowing past the target scores you can still lose points if you have an off day - *plus* it’s highly disproportionate. I might double the target score, but if it’s 5% lower than yesterday I’ll still lose 10 points off my category score.

I can’t attach a screen caps, but I just got three new high scores and two rank ups for a grand total of +9 across four categories. 

Yesterday I lost 10 points in one category for scoring about 15% lower on one game (out of three I played in the category) than I did previously. 

It’s nonsensical.Pros: great presentation and variety of games, achievements and comparing scores is fun. No external ads is nice. 

Cons: can only play 3-5 pre-selected games once, and only one time per day, unless you pay for Pro as a monthly subscription (yuck) or one-time $100 charge (double yuck); game sandbags your score initially so you feel inclined to pay and play. 

It’s a really nice-looking game, but there are so many comparable and less expensive/free “brain training” apps out there that paying to use this one makes no sense.Pros: the games are simple, fun and you are scored per game (shows bell curve of your performance based on other users at your rank) as well as track your overall progress.

Cons: bell curve percentile includes 100 which should really only be out of 99... Also, I’m not sure why I can score pretty consistently in the 90th percentile (or so) yet my “brain map” is smaller than the average for my age group 🤔. Based on this data, I question the accuracy of the app and its data quality of the overall brain map. 🤷🏻‍♀️It’s a good game that has help me in many ways. Still using the free version waiting for the next sale before I buy the paid version. One thing I don’t like is that I have used the game everyday and this is the third time my streak counter went back to one. I haven’t missed a day since I started so I don’t understand why it’s messing up. Wish they would fix this issue so I can actually see how many days I’ve been doing it. Other then that a great game to playAs someone who is pretty confident in her strengths and weaknesses I found it hilarious that my highest scores were in emotion and my lowest were in problem solving. I’m mildly autistic and have a successful career as a lawyer where I solve complex problems for a living. Every official test I’ve ever taken has ranked my language skills as low and my problem solving and special recognition as high, this app tells me the opposite so I can only assume there is some bunk science going in here. Most of the games are fun though.I get that developers want to make money. But I don’t want a subscription. I’m happy to watch a few video ads once in a while. But this game has gone from offering a few free games per day to requiring a video ad I between each “free” game to now making you watch a full 30 second ad just to see your score on a “free” game. This is a perfect example of an ad experience making this app unusable. I’ll sadly be deleting.I LOVE Peak! This app is so amazing and the subscription is worth every penny! But I haven’t even been able to play my daily workout since the new update. I’ll open the app and all that comes up is a blank white screen where the daily workout square should be.. I’m able to see and click on the other workouts, just not my daily one. I lost my daily streak because I haven’t been able to do my daily workouts!Peak was great until my score dropped 40 points every time they have me play a new game even though the instructions specifically say new games won’t drop your score. I was at 670 now 602 because I’m forced to play new games. I love the new games but not when they drop my score and not when I never see that game again to potentially increase my score.The better you get, the harder it is. Makes sense, right?  But certain games only let you advance with one condition and that is a ridiculously high brain score. I have a high score, have been playing a long time but at a certain point it is a brick wall. Bad design. Also no new games as long as I’ve been playing. So it’s lots of fun at first then it just sort of becomes frustrating.Used to be great.  I recently got back on here, and I don’t recall there being this many ads before.  It also freezes during them, usually after games where I do really well, so I never get to actually see my score, and it doesn’t count it.  I’d say about half or more of the ads freeze the app or kick you out.

Also, some of the grammar/punctuation games aren’t always correct.Super fun but it’s annoying that the “instruction” videos for each game/puzzle are not available when you don’t have internet connection. I bought this game to play on the subway (no cell service) and any time a new game comes up in my daily puzzle pack it’s hard to learn how to play without the instructions and it messes my scores up.The games are interesting, but I feel that it’s not worth my time to jump through hoops in order to level each of them up to the point where they’re hard enough to feel like a mental exercise.  I also don’t like how your overall score across all games artificially increases over time as you level up your games and thus unlock greater scoring potential.This is HANDS DOWN my favorite game.

However since the new update…
1. the screen freezes when you get you score after the game.
2. when looking at your score over time the app freezes if you change the period of time shown in the graph (ex. from 1 month to 1 week or from 3 months to 1 month, etc)I would give Peak five stars until recently.  When I complete a training
module, instead of going directly to the next module,I get the score I earned on the previous game on a blank white screen and I have to shut down my computer to go to the next training game.  Help!  Is it just me or can you fix it?They’ve put in way too many ads, especially with this latest update. And even though your scores improve in their games over time, I definitely haven’t noticed any change in my memory/problem-solving skills/etc. in the past few months I’ve been playing. Not worth your time and all the ads.I’m not a fan of the “You’ve done better before. Why not try again?” messages after you play each game, especially when I feel like I’ve done pretty well (oh no! I didn’t get a new high score. I should feel like garbage now). The messages come off as negative and condescending and honestly have made me consider canceling my pro account.You lost two stars for two reasons:
1st star: Everything needs to be paid for! I can do like 4 games a day and l can't even see my full progress!
2nd star: I heard from multiple people that they all star off really bad. I do too. It makes you look really bad so that you want to keep doing it. All of the stuff I do really great at aren't my top score.
Otherwise, the app is great.I worked very hard to get a 500 Brainiac score and the minute I achieved it, after 200+ days, I went to see my pixel score and boom they’d updated to 600. No satisfaction whatsoever. Hard to compete with someone moving the goalposts. I’ll be leaving when my subscription is done. Now I just play around without any goals, might as well be solitaire.I normally don’t right reviews but this is an is a problem. As the title says the time is to fast, time needs to be more (like 60 seconds or a little more) some people need more time to think it out. They also might feel pressured, which would give them incorrect scores.I played this with interest and joy up until you need to watch an ad before and after every play.  When they added an ad before you got your score - the last straw.  The app is pricey for an occasional user ... it was supposed to be a distraction rather than a devotion.  Not worth it in the long run.Bought the pro subscription, not sure it was worth it. Some of the games are fun, some are just obnoxious and have no way to improve score other than luck and some categories seriously lack game options. It could use improvement for sure but it’s not awful.It was pretty cool at first showing me all my stats but then when I tried to play a game again to get a higher score, it tells me I need to upgrade to pro. Personally I do t like to spend money on apps but if your the kind of person thats is willing to pay a monthly fee than it’s great.It’s been awhile since I have used the app but now my performance is hindered by the ads that pop up during a session. The timer will not stop and my score is inaccurate! Please fix!I signed up for Pro for a month.  FAQ says new games do not count against your score for a while.  That is not true.  My score goes down each time there is a new game in my workout.  My score has reduced by 74 since playing Pro workouts in the last 2 weeks.It’s enjoyable enough but I find it disappointing it’s dictionary for word games is lacking. It makes games that score strategy and speed around language difficult to master because you never know when an ordinary word won’t be counted.I’ve been using the app for a couple weeks now and just testing out the free version for now. I don’t understand why my coordination score is the lowest, yet I consistently score higher than 99% of users in the flame dodge game.  Is there a reason for this?Was working great. Latest update causes freezing of the score screen. You have to close the app and then reopen it. Was working great, why fix something not broken?I like most of the games and it’s a fun app, but my workouts have been bugging on me, and having me repeat a game that I just did.  I can’t get through a whole workout anymore, which isn’t helpful if you’re trying to get an achievement for a long streak.Seems like this app has been losing connection lately as the score hasn't been updating nor daily games (featured).Great way to spend some down time. Lots of games that are fun to play. However one thing that needs to change is the ranking system for the games. Having to reach 900 brain score is crazy. Rankings should be based on game performance alone.I had the peak app and loved it. Something happen and I had to reinstall which lost my scores. I reinstalled it and now there are so many more adds which gets tedious. Why has peak changed so much? 🙁Often the ads freeze up, so when you wait for the ad to finish so you can see your score, you hit the x and nothing happens. You have to kill the app.I’d appreciate it if I didn’t lose my 65 day streak after completing my workout at 12:01 the next day. An option that included freeze streaks, such as in Duolingo, would be very helpful.I like the concept. I don’t like that I can only play once a day. I’d like to improve my scores and play more times without having to pay for a subscription.

I upgraded to pro pretty much right after the first little test, and don’t regret it. Only issues are first the comparison seems to be weird. It’s basically comparing your overall score to others and seems to me it’s not about your performance or brain power or anything, rather just the longer you play the higher your score. 
The other issue I’m having is incredibly frustrating. The little “how to play movies” never finish. Like 1-2 seconds into it it just goes to the reply screen. Every game I’ve played I’ve gone in with no instructions, which is really frustrating. Please fix this!!It’s a system, that is certainly fun, but I don’t know how useful it is. They show and evaluate the data of your games to assess where your “peak score” is. To show where your brain marks up against people of different age groups. The more data they have (games played) the higher your score is, because you continually are playing at a higher level, which makes the game more fun, but I don’t know if the speed in which you are able to drag a picture of a smiley face to another really determines how emotionally intelligent you are. 
Like I said it’s fun, have fun with it, but if you’re actually trying to assess your brain competency, I don’t know if this is best for you.I really enjoy doing this daily, it’s one of the first things I do for the day. You get ranked in each of seven categories that contribute to an overall score and can compare your score with friends, your age group, or specific professions. Love it.

However, they really push you to buy the full version and make it blatantly obvious. I get so many memory and language exercises every week, but maybe only one or two coordination and problem solving exercises each per week, so the “workouts” are very poorly distributed in the free version.Dunno how much it helps with keeping your mind sharp but the games are engaging. Scores do improve over time but who knows if that’s simply learning what to look for. Peak does have multiple games that if you are red/green color blind you’re going to have struggles.

The main thing that bothers me with this app is the opaque way you are scored in each category.
My overall percentile is 61 percent, in language I’m at 85 memory I’m at 80. But in every other category well.  99 percent of the population is better at problem solving than I am I guess. 
No matter how much my scores improve in these categories, the percentile never moves which is irksome to say the least.
What else bothers me? I absolutely hate the vibration when I get an incorrect answer, it totally throws me off track. I also despise a few games, happy river, is just really stupid and jump control could easily cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Despite these grievances, all in all, it seems to be a more productive distraction than say, candy crush, and some games are really enjoyable. Pixel logic is my absolute favorite. I’m still uncertain as to whether ones mental faculties are actually expanded by playing these games. I’m fairly certain the juries still out on that one.Peak is great and it definitely exercises my brain and keeps it sharper than it otherwise would. But I recently UPGRADED to Pro and all of my STATS went DOWN. I imagine this is because with the availability of all the other games, now there are suddenly a lot of zeros being taken into consideration from the games I have yet to play, but it was honestly incredibly DISHEARTENING when I looked at my progress and my stats had all dropped by at least 20%. All of my hard work and progress suddenly felt erased or disappeared, and though I know it's still there in my head, seeing my chart shrink in a major way is certainly not motivating, especially for someone who just shelled out the MONEY to be able to get even better. Maybe that's not something that occurred to anyone during programming, but it would be very nice if there were a DIFFERENT WAY of introducing unplayed games to the overall scores.So I love just about everything about this app. It's fun and I feel like I really am training my brain. However, my only complaint about this app (so far) is that it does not have enough information. For example, on the game called Grow you're supposed to create as many words as possible out of just a few letters, the bigger the better. One of my groups of letters was ""mas"" so immediately the biggest word I could think of was Massachusetts. Awesome for points right? No. The game kept telling me it wasn't a word, so I wasted time spelling it differently thinking I might be spelling it wrong, which caused me to get a low score. I spelled it correctly. I checked. It's frustrating because I cant replay the game (without paying) and I really do want to know my progress. This issue occurred with more than just this word. How can I learn when the game might not be as knowledgeable about certain things as I am?I love this app! But I am having a little bit of a hard time understanding exactly where I am at or where I should be scoring for my age and compared to others my age (if I’m doing well or not). When it shows the percentages for a game, it varies so much and I can’t tell if it’s just based on the game in general, if how many times you play it goes into account or if it’s because the difficulty changes the more you play? 
For example: It will say I’m scoring higher that 95% of others, then say I’m only higher than 36% on the same game when I replay it and my score didn’t change much, so I wonder what the factors are that change it so drastically. I guess I just kind of want to know the lowest and highest that can be scored? Also, how you get the numbers for the summary showing all the categories on the chart?Some of the exercises are clearly well thought out, challenging and exciting. Others, such as Word Fresh, lack in depth and opportunities for progress. Hitting a ceiling, it seemed the only next level to reach was Brainiac which required an overall brain score of 700. After about two weeks it seemed I had crossed that threshold yet nothing happened. So I checked again what the requirements were to reach Brainiac status. Mind you, the developers had not updated the app in at least 3 weeks yet mysteriously the overall score requirement to reach the Brainiac level had been changed from 700 to 800. It seems that’s one way to get around having to develop more challenging levels in an part of the app. Maybe I should cancel my subscription.I love this app and use it everyday. It’s a lot of fun and I recommend it to others all the time. 

That said, there should be an option to turn off certain games such as JUMP. I have long-term damage in both hands so placing three fingers on the pads is nearly impossible. Believe me. I’ve tried all kinds of techniques. Holding the phone differently; using a flat surface; two thumbs and a pointer finger; pointer, middle and thumb; etc. I really dislike the way my overall score is pummeled when I do poorly on JUMP. 

I do know there are options for color blindness and dyslexia in the settings screen but there are no options for physical disabilities—or frankly even just disliking a game and not wanting to pursue it.This would be 5 stars if:
-there was more randomization of the games, it feels like I play the same 5 or 6 all the time.
- they changed the word “multiplier” to “bonus.” Multipliers multiply things and they aren’t multiplying anything, but they are adding bonus points.
-my biggest wish is for us to be able to create our own daily workouts that count toward our streaks. As it is I could play 7 games of my choosing and they don’t count towards my streak. 
- allow us to pause our streaks if we need to. I have a chronic illness so some days I physically cannot play, and it is demoralizing to see a multi-month streak wiped out because I was in the hospital. 
- add other stats like days played since start, days played out of the last 100/ month/week etc. 
- make the robot on the Connect Em’ Up game less of a jerk. We know we lost, he doesn’t need to be a jerk about it. 
I’ve been using Peak for more than a year and it is overall a great product. I obviously think very highly of it, and would be a raving fan if the wishes above were granted.Love the app but the PBS calculation in fundamentally flawed. Your PBS will only be realistically where it should be after putting in a certain number of hours. I’ve been performing in the top 98%+ in most games, yet my PBS is still way low at 300. You need to change the algorithm to allow users to have an accurate PBS score with less total play time. EDIT: Will revise review to five stars once you fix this ridiculously frustrating PBS score. I was 99th percentile in every game I played today and lost a ton of PBS score. Absolutely destroyed perilous path today and it said it took me an avg of 7.33 seconds when there’s no way it took me more than 2 seconds on any given puzzle.This app is awesome, for multiple reasons! I love the games but I just have one problem, its the streak achievements. So the problem is that in order to achieve grandmaster on some games or to even get a higher rank, I need to complete my workout for I think 14 days in a row (maybe more, im not sure for grandmaster rank). In order to not get bored with the games, I need them to get harder and to rank up. I am also a really busy guy, so I could really only get a 5-7 day streak at a time, which means I couldnt progress and I got bored recently. So I’m kind of stuck. If you could please change the app so you dont have to achieve a really long streak to progress that would be nice, thanks.Annoyed because I have literally played this game every day and it seems just as I’m about to get my 14 day streaks it resets. It just happened again. I had about 10 days I just looked at it then as I was doing my workout I looked and it had reset back to 1. I hadn’t even finished the workout so how did it reset to 1?  I play at bedtime around midnight so perhaps this is when it resets but for the price (I am pro) I would expect a time clock or something. Last time this happened I was on day 13 trying to get a 14 day streak. Makes me want to delete the app. 

Gave 4 stars though cuz games are fun and addictive. But please help me figure out this streak business!Ok I’m not claiming, or pretending to be a genius, but I can hold my own and have scored fairly high I all the tests I’ve been subjected to when I enlisted in the U. S. Army back in 1973. Plus I’ve been told I scored fairly high in the battery of test to find my IQ, back in my younger days, that told my parents and I that I was a few points above average, so I’m not a dummy by any stretch of the imagination. I don’t know what the science is behind these games/tests, but I have to be honest, I thought I would do better. But maybe that’s a key, the more you do the more challenging it will get, but also easier over time.My only complaint is that certain games seem to either accelerate too fast or are too slow. This could just be a personal issue, but the Tap Trap goes from to 3000 in 2 seconds and it’s hard to work on my score when the cards go by faster than I can comprehend. On the other end the game with the blimps where you guess the words? I couldn’t get those things to move faster if I tried, it also makes it hard to improve my score because it never gets over a certain point since the blimps all move at a really slow paceGames are fun. Love that there is a wide variety. Graphics are nice. But several of the games won’t consistently register my touch and one game is actually too sensitive. I have a relatively new iPad, updated it, and rebooted it and the app. I’ve written to customer support and they have failed to write back after about a month and two tries, the last more than a week ago. I would give it five stars, but around 15-20% of games malfunction thereby lowering my scores.The app is amazing and is a great way to challenge your brain. My one problem though is that I had a streak of a little over 30 days going and when I opened the app today I saw that it had gone down to a zero day streak. When I completed the games and checked the daily summary it showed that I have played every day for the past 30 days. The streak however still said zero (now it would be one cense I finished today’s workout). I’m not too upset about this because it’s a great app but I am curious why this happened.I enjoy this app, the games, and the interface, but at the point in time when I paid money for it, I definitely believed (based on the amount of info they provide about how new games will impact your scores) that there would be new games being added to app. It has been years since anything new was added and I’m ready for some variety—pretty sure that just mastering this set isn’t promoting the kind of brain growth that novelty would.For those saying the game denies real words, I have though that too a few times, but you're likely misspelling the word or using a proper noun (i.e. Massachusetts) Shepard is the name, shepherd is the noun for the person a few below me. 

My only complaints are about Asteroid Defense, Happy River, and Word Alike. The first two depend largely on luck to score high (given the time constraints) and the latter is full of stretches in logic and word association overcome only by rote memorization. 

Other than that, worth the time and even the money.I have played this game for sometime. A Pro user with a 98% percentile with the longest streak of 50 days+. In the beginning the games really helped me improve my brain cognition. After I missed one workout day and lost my longest streak I kinda lost interest. Probably because the lack of new games. But I like how peal comes out with some limited festive games. Would rate this app and love it more if there was more games otherwise I think I would eventually not play this game. Hard to believe I’m legend in some of these games tho.Overall, I love this app.  My only complaint is that when it throws new games at you (which you inevitably start at a beginner level), your overall performance rating is severely degraded by the inclusion of the new, low (i.e., beginner) scores.  My overall rating dropped 4 percentage points in the last 2 days because I got 3 first-time games (not the same ones) on consecutive days.  Their ranking algorithm should factor that in and not punish the user for things outside their control (i.e., being given new games).There are a few things that could improve the user experience.
1. Allow me to set what the time parameters of my “day”. I hate when I mess up a streak because I didn’t get it before midnight. 
2. For games like Objectifind it would helpful at the end instead of going straight to the score screen if it highlighted or identified the item you were last searching for. 
3. Coordination and Emotion need more than their respective two and three games. I don’t feel these are enough to accurate score in these categories. 
4. There should be an option to see (in table format, 2-3 columns) each game title, category and rank in one place.  
5. Are there new games coming? Is that an option? I love my subscription but I’m getting bored. I’ve already long since identified which games are my favorite and which I don’t like as much.The games are great!  I have been playing them for three weeks now and I enjoy the challenges of each one I have played.   But the scoring makes no sense at all. It said I was in the 100th percentile on a game tonight and I played it again and did even better!  But then it said I was in the 23rd percentile!  It’s like that all the time. Scores are inaccurate and don’t transfer correctly to my totals. I got it for the good holiday price of $19 for a year though, and I enjoy playing so, oh well.I’ve been having a lot of fun progressing in the various categories but my streak counter keeps resetting for no reason. The first time it happened I thought maybe I just forgot to play the day before but then it happened again, and today was supposed to be my 20th day streak but then it happened a 3rd time. It’s especially frustrating since some games won’t let you progress until you hit certain streaks.

Please fix this!Some of the games are fun, and I like that they get harder as you improve. The streak tracker is pretty buggy which is frustrating as you need long streaks to level up, and even waiting till it registers your daily result doesn’t work 100% of the time. 

FYI, “perfect” games aren’t highlighted as a goal till your level makes it much harder to achieve, so do yourself a favor and focus on that early on even if there’s no goal yet or you might get stuck.I love the games, and the streak tracker does an okay job at keeping me consistent in my workouts. That said, I bought this app as a mental workout for my family, but soon discovered that I can only compare to FB friends. My family is on the same family plan, but several of them don’t use FB because it’s pretty bad for anxiety. That means I can’t track my progress against them in this game. As a friendly competitor, that removes a good deal of motivation for me.Great concept and execution but annoying-ware and the ads get more and more annoying the longer we resist paying the high usage fee (renews each month/year👎). Sometimes there’s a sale but the price is still high. Also, some ads break the app, requiring hard app reset, which breaks the summary screen (all previous scores are 0); hopefully doesn’t affect saved scores (?). ➡️ Ads are annoying!! ⬅️Hey, this app is great but I have a few ideas to make it better. 
1. When you don’t have peak pro you can click on a game and it will give you two options, to view your stats or play the game so you don’t have to watch a video to see your stats. 
2. For the game of the day you could make it be able to be played for free as well as your regular workout just to give people a bonus game every day. 
3. Make it so you can compare your scores with people in your contacts via email/phone. 
4. You also probably won’t want to do this but make the 6 workout games free for non pro people or give non pro players an extra smaller workout. 
Again these are just things that I think would improve the app.I love Peak and have been using the app for awhile, but only recently on a daily basis. I’ve been completing the daily workouts, but somehow my ‘streak’ keeps resetting to zero. I typically do workouts in the morning and notice that on days where I don’t check in until later in the day, the streak is back at zero. If it’s designed to reset every 24 hours, that doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.Just have one issue with this game and that is if you miss one day of training you lose your streak no matter how long it was. Would love to see (at least for pro players like me) a one day (2 at the most) streak freeze where if you are having a slammed day and just can’t get to it you don’t lose your streak.I know it says not to move your fingers from the touch pad but I won’t be moving my fingers at all and it’ll say I moved them and take time off my clock resulting it in making it impossible to get higher scores. Idk if there’s a weird glitch but it’s never done this to me in the past.I like the training and switching up the games. I don’t like the new update that tells you that you didn’t reach your high score and to try again. I found it discouraging in the workout to be told several times that I had scored higher in the past. It is normal to score higher, then lower with an overall improvement trend.I’m content with the free version for now but I’d recommend buying the upgrade as you would have more games to play.

There’s a noticeable difference of points between playing any of the games in the morning versus later at night.

I like the amount of information the app gives depending on your scores for the various games.I enjoy the training and the competition with a couple friends. BUT it is hard to understand how they can “dock”points on your daily score from categories that they didn’t test that day. It makes the “scoring” overall suspect. So, depending on why you are interested in this app is whether or not that will bother you.The app is amazing and very fun but there is one problem. One time I got a very high score in a emotions game, my score on emotion overall was 188. After the game it turned DOWN to 176, it was very annoying. I think that may be a bug, if it is please try to fix it brainbow. Everyone have a amazing day and thank you for your time. BYE!!!!!I really really love this app and would give it a 5 but the answers on spin cycle don’t always get marked correctly, it’s jacking up my score! I’d love for that to be corrected, outside of that I love all the other brain exercise games, even the hard onesI love Peak! But in the Face Switch game it asks if the man is wearing glasses and in some of the ones where he is wearing them it marks it as he isn’t and on some of the ones where he isn’t wearing them it marks it as he is. This is annoying and my scores have dramatically dropped since it started doing this...I love these games and wanted full access so I signed up for the subscription.

I am a little skeptical of the rankings, but perhaps I’m overthinking it.

The games for the most part are intuitive, however they have finer points to them and it’s not always clear how to play or what the main focus is. For the game Grow I am still unclear if I need to order my words from shortest to longest to maximize my score 🤷‍♀️
Sometimes the ‘tips’ are actually rules or goals of the game. Is there a way to review the full set of tips before starting play?I love Peak and I loved it even more before we bought the thing with the family plan. Now I can’t compare with friends and it won’t connect to Facebook. Now that I can’t compare with my husband, I’m losing interest. Where’s the challenge in beating my own scores.I play peak every day and have seen a steady improvement in my performance. However, twice in the last two weeks (on Thursdays, oddly enough), my daily workout hasn’t registered so my streak starts over every Friday. A minor detail but pretty annoying.I love Peak. I play daily but I’m so frustrated by the bugs on word path. It glitches and it stops recognizing words or it glitches and won’t let you place tiles. Very frustrating and messes with your score!A fun challenging app. But w/ some of the challenges I know FOR SURE I got the right answer but it says “wrong” negatively effecting my score and raises doubt in the many other times where I think I may be wrong or maybe hit the incorrect button.Love the app. You need more coordination games though. That wouldn’t have kept me away, but after achieving a 14 day streak there was no real celebration besides unlocking the next badge without fanfare! Didn’t inspire me to try for a 20 day streak and now I’m back at 0 :/There should be more coordination games. It is one of the factors used to calculate your brain score, but only offers two games, versus the other areas being measured.If they fix word path for one, it would be great. So tired of getting good scores then for whatever reason- the game won’t let me plat my letter or starts telling me “invalid word”. I’ve videoed it and sent it in. Never heard back.Strret Nav memory game always malfunctions, ending my game prematurely, no matter how careful I am when swiping. When are the newer games going to be included in overall score? They’re not so new anymoreScoring is inconsistent.  Success rate is an absolutely terrible metric.  

If I’m cranking out double the score at 97%, the 100% player taking 6 seconds a photo should not be in a higher percentile. Doesn’t give a good grasp where you actually place.You guys need to fix a bug on “jump control” game. It keeps jumping even when all my fingers are on the right place and this mistake lowers my score. But I love the app a lot though.It’s a cool idea! And I love the games, the sounds are very satisfying, but I wish the little blurbs and “performance insights” wouldn't stroke my ego so much, like if I got a bad score just tell me; I can take it. But that’s just me. Maybe add a “hardcore trainer” setting :Pthis app seems pretty good but Face Switch answers are often scored wrong when the right answer is made, resulting in an inaccurately low score, disappointing.",1,"I guess everyone is a geniusSuddenly Set BackGreat except...👍Mixed bagNeeds Options For Turning Off Games6 WishesPBSGood but 1 suggestionStreaks?Sandman4x4FunGood appGreat games but some malfunction and lack of customer supportGreat AppNever any new games :(You people should spell check your reviews...I think unbiasedGreat App w/1 FlawGreat but not AmazingFun games but scores are inaccurateGreat game but streak keeps resettingDecent Games that Get HarderGood App, but FB dependentGreat but AnnoyingIdea‘Streaks’ Don’t Make SenseOverall a great brain exercise gameThere’s an issue with the game “Jump Control”Great trainingFree version is good enough!Good butGreat just one thing.Great for mind exercise, but one specific game is messed upLove it except...Fantastic, with room for growth4/5 because...Challenging and fun but...Please fix bug on word path!!Wrong answers sometimesMore positive reinforcement!More variety neededAlmost GreatEnjoy playing PEAK, but have a few minor issues.Fun - Poor ScoringPlease, fix a bugHardcore Trainer!Unreliable Face Switch Game",DfladgeAvery NightAliRose222Massage1$cv888TxWriterMamaJynxyBugFischguy111g4l4xicRiverShredderSandman4x4FunshllebyyJenshrinkEisenreichsWrbakerDreamy in DenverSoftOnDemandPaul Atreides IiMspencerH26AuntsuzabelleVidkid41Sarag693Allen L.JohnnyDee62scouterflySarah_MidnightStevie B'slauburnJPL20km653ScarWSOSway360Production6muddreaderCal~FuzzyWuzzyRabidBunnyMcSurly214HauteMammaLewi 74samantha.ann.kennySmc50322MrBrain77first mate jenNeSteensonKateBennett1242Tumblenanracquetball hound,"{'id': 27485011, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us; we really appreciate it!

I’ve been playing this at the pro level for a few months now and I enjoy seeing the progress and I feel like it helps me expand my mind and improve the skills that it focuses on which improves how I do my work and interact with others.  I enjoy it enough to have it be one of the first things I do on a daily basis.  It’s actually like a required step in my day.  Which brings me to the star reduction. 
Today I logged on and I had been somewhere in the 90’s for my playing streak.  Yesterday, I played it as I always do.  Today I opened it and my streak said 0 days.  I thought it was an error and would reset after I did the daily workout (because I’ve opened it before and observed that the interface behaved “differently”, I just assumed that this was a one off thing).  But after I did my workout, it updated the day count to one.  That is a big that seriously frustrates me.  
All of the other issues I have with these games have been covered by other reviewers except for the fact that if you name a game Word Fresh Zen and push some of the craziest letter combinations as words, then you had better include the word ZEN as a real word.
Thanks.I was trying Neuronation app before I met this one. They structured it and designed very well. I am looking forward to the next day to better my memory and focus. I usually am very forgettable and lose focus too quickly. I give it a 4.5 stars since today was my first day and I liked it. I like the stats where I can see my progress and I will check it over time to see how I improve. I want to build my memory muscles and focus muscles. I think I found the app that will do that for me. What I like, is that it is backed up by universities and science. So I feel good that I have proven exercises to help me train these areas of my brain. I personally can’t wait to see the changes it will make in my daily life after whole of playing this and bettering my brain muscles. I would recommend this app. I really like how they organized it. They built in this streak for you to keep track. Also I like how they have a few levels from “novice” all the way to “legend”. The games feel very professional and I feel good that I will feel the benefits of these exercises in my daily life. I just really liked it how they have all my stats and progress organized.Been practicing for over a week now with a one year subscription. Peak is fun, addictive while delivering a perfect brain wake up call each morning. 

Peak balances challenge with delightful interface in most games (e.g. compared to the ‘heaviness’ of Luminosity’s game design). I am feeling I can keep going until perfecting on all games as it feels like play time than exam time even though I check score each time...

Compared to other brain game apps I used in the past or currently use, Peak keeps a fresh edge, in its relatively large and diverse selection of games under each section, well targeted to specific brain training dimensions. I like the variety also certain twist on some games common to apps in this category. 

One drawback I have so far, & thus a deduction of 1 Star,  is the rather limited selection under ‘Coordination’ & ‘Emotion’, each with merely 2 or 3 games total right now. That’s just not enough games to either measure user’s performance properly or help user improve on those skills over time. I would say 5-8 games at least to be taken seriously. Or those tiers would also get repetitive than engaging very quickly. 

Though I appreciate there is an ‘Emotion’ section to start with.

Hope there will be improvement for the above from developer in coming weeks.Overall I like this app. I like brain games and I like watching my little brain score go up. I could play for hours honestly. It’s really satisfying and it’s nice to have trackable progress. I just wish it didn’t have to be a subscription. I’m over the subscription craze we’re in and while I’d probably pay good money for this app and be happy to do it o don’t want to pay monthly for it, and unless I suddenly come into wealth I don’t think I ever will. I’d even pay to buy the games in packs so you could buy all the memory games, or all the language games or the emotional awareness games- but I won’t subscribe. Do play this game, you’ll enjoy it.I really enjoy using this app. The brain needs to be exercised and most of the time that is accomplished through academic studies, but not everyone has the luxury to do that on a daily basis. This app is a great solution to that problem. It’s fast, easy in execution and accessible. I have bought the full version and would recommend it to others.

For the developers: 
Can you please fix Word Hunt. There really is no way to improve the score, unless you are finding a word every half second. Try it yourself and I think you will agree that there needs to be some rethinking how it’s point system works. Thank you in advance.I love this app. I have a yearly subscription to it, and I try to train with it every day, usually doing more than one training option. I would give it five stars without hesitation except that some of the games, especially ones that have a lot of moving things on the screen, have a strange glitch where they seem to jump ahead by just about a half a second, which is just enough to throw off a streak of correct answers, which then causes one’s score to suffer. I mentioned this to the game developers but they never got back to me and the issue hasn’t been resolved.Peak is a great brain game to test your skills however I have 2 complaints. 
1.) You have to spend a lot of money just to play all of the games. There should be a way to earn these privileges, like maybe earning a game if you do your daily brain workout every day for 20 days, or if you beat the high score of 5000 in smile on me, then you win the ability to play every game that involves emotion, the options are unlimited!
2.) The game needs to let your brain compare itself to younger ages. I am still a minor but can only compare it to people who are older than 19. It doesn’t really relate.
All in all, this is a great game and helps me think outside the boxThe only reason Peak isn’t getting a five star rating from me is because, without paying or premium or whatever it is, you can only do ONE (1) exercise per day. So if I do terribly, that means I have to wait until tomorrow to get a better score. (It’s honestly diabolical.) 

It’s an EXCELLENT app, with activities that are both challenging and fun—it’s a combination that keeps me coming back, strengthens my resolve, and makes me feel proud of myself.  

And it’s not just the same stuff every day, which was a pleasant surprise. You’ll play a game like Scrabble one day and something completely different the next, and it you never really know what it’ll be. 

One of my absolute favorite things about Peak, though, is the reminders. When I allowed the app to send me notifications, they offered to send me a reminder every day to complete my daily exercise—all I had to do was set the time. But I’m so hooked on it that it’s generally one of the first things I do in the morning.The app works flawless for me. There are a number of mini-games or challenges you can do everyday. At the end of a session (5games in a row) you get presented with a summary, how you compare against others in your age, gender etc group. It also gives you a detailed overview of your areas of strength and weaknesses. 

If it really improves and helps your brain, I don't know. I certainly get better with the scores of the challenges but I have not seen any real life changes, yet. But definitively a better use of your time then most activities we do on our phone everyday.I love this app and really believe in all the benefits of training your brain. I’ve seen the benefits in my own life. My only suggestion/recommendation is it’d be really nice to have something like a streak-freeze for the pro account users. Maybe if you accumulated so many workout days under your belt (like every 14) you’d earn a streak freeze and you’d be able to employ it when life (or cell service) gets in the way so it doesn’t reset your streak all the way back to a big fat zero. Just a suggestion. 😁I really do like this one. I’ve tried several different similar-ish brain apps. This is the only one I’ve kept. I even kept it prior to purchasing my cheap year subscription! I only made the low cost purchase because I was playing it so much and trying to see how well I could do. I strongly suggest to give it a try. You can compare your scores to others in your age group, in your profession, or even friends. So go see how high you can get your scores and enjoy testing yourself and exercising your brain at the same time!!Been using peak (pro on and off) since summer 2017 and I definitely feel it working. Getting quicker at completing little day to day tasks and am steadily raising my scores, now at over 900 in everything but problem solving. One complaint— the word path game breaks down 25% of the time, like it’ll tell me the words aren’t valid or it won’t let me place the final tile where I need it. And it’s been like this since 2017 so I’m wondering how often the developers are quality checking the games.It’s fun to see how far you’ve come and how you stack up to others. The UI is clean & beautiful and there are some throwbacks to the video games of the 80-90s. I’d love see more coordination games but they come out with new games frequently. The scoring and what you should be doing differently to achieve the goal score could use more explanation. Hitting a wall with multiple games and I’m not sure what I can do beyond get faster. Can’t wait to play more!I like the concept, I haven’t been using it very long but I do like it so far. The only thing I would suggest is personalized exercises for people with mental disabilities. For example I have ADHD-C and a Learning Disorder in Mathematics. Because of this I may not score very well in some areas for reasons beyond my control causing my overall score to be skewed. Other than that great app and great idea.I absolutely love this game. I’ve been playing it for months. The only bad thing I have come across is that there is only one game in the category of “coordination” in the free version of the app. That makes my individual “coordination” score the lowest. Ultimately, I wish it had more coordination games for me to play so that I could bring up my score.This game is amazing and I only have one complaint. Well Maybe 2.😂. I wish that you didn’t need pro to play the games as many times that you want because if you want it re try it and try better you can’t you have to wait until the game comes up again. But overall it’s really good and fun I have a 6 day streaks is far!Overall, I love this app. It’s a great way to keep you mind sharp. However, it used to have a feature where you could connect it with your Facebook account and compare your scores to your friends’, but this has been broken for quite some time now. Otherwise, this is an awesome appThe only thing I find annoying about this game is the badges. It might say score higher than # and it won’t give you the badge after you’ve done that. Also I wish it would give you reasons at the end for why you might’ve answered something wrong.There’s a few games that I KNOW I’m not doing wrong and it still sings my score or time. It’s driving me nuts because I just keep replaying them with no solution or option to notify of a mistake. 

That being said, I do love the app overall. Most of the games are amazing and fun.I absolutely love this app!   The only thing to me that would be an improvement is that once you hit a score there should be no going backwards. That has been frustrating especially when reaching higher ranks.I Like The Fact That They Make Percentages And In A Way I Get To See How I Outdid My Score Or The Others. Although I Find The Ads Too Much and Annoying And The Fact That You Must Watch One Every Time For 30 Secs In Order To Replay, Sth That You Won’t Find In The Competitors Apps!I do look forward to playing it everyday. I like the variety of games, the graphics, and sound effects. It's cool! The only thing I would want is for them to have grace period for the streak. Since it’a a paid app, that would be nice.This app makes me feel awesome about myself! Whenever I get a good score, it makes me feel like I’m really smart! It also tells you how much better you are than what percent of users. It’s great. I totally recommend it! 😊😊😊I am enjoying this app. I do look forward to improvements on Word Fresh as some words like “eerie” or “europe” aren't recognized as words (and I thought I was going to get a high score!)",1,"Love the app but I hate bugsPretty well created appPeak Performance Awaits...One thingGreat game, but have an issue for the developers.Excellent but sometimes glitchesGreat Game But...4 outta 5 (For pettiness)Good little Brain TeasersLove this AppGreat app!Definitely workingI’m addicted!Cool app but some recommendations.Why is there only 1 game for “coordination”?AJ’S review on PEAKCool app, with a broken featureGreat except small annoyanceFew quirks, but love it overallAddictive!!Needs ImprovementGreat game but...Self-Esteem Booster!!Challenging",XRayman1961Pr.abhuAppDeeDeeMonte_CristoGreatest game on the iPadAudiebertgabbadab😎Anna_b3ll3mbglobetrotterH BizzSuthrngal18kim.vuLainyLaneJjjahajhajaakshhahaj_coopmhuletdevazul-pyeReviewingisannoying2765sandyr59FarnazzzzToyKerBoxerMomma174Lake City L,"{'id': 27787819, 'body': 'Hi XRayman1961!

Can you stop those two games from appearing for me to play ? Please help because I like peak but Elevate and Lumosity suit my needs now. Thank you. Cheryl DunbarPEAK... please fix the workout bugs!! I’m getting so frustrated with starting a workout of my choosing (specifically the individual category workouts), only to complete my first game in the workout & have it boot me into a different workout screen.  It doesn’t register my play at all, however, it records the new high scores achieved - but this is so frustrating because I can’t get anywhere with the workout i wanted to do.  it keeps kicking me back to the Just For You category, which typically didn’t even involve the game i was playing.  Please fix!  I really like this app, and wish I could play the workouts I want!I can see how my mental skill have improved since I tried it first but a week ago everything time I enter the game it keeps loading and I can’t play it, so I restarted my phone and then it worked but the next days it was the same. Please I don’t want to lose again my streak I’ve recommended your game to a lot of people and they love it so I don’t want them to have the same issue as me. Is there something you can do about it or why is this happening? Thank youUsed to be good around 675+ (no subscription, just playing free games)... then, all of a sudden, introducing rarer games. I play them well, for a 1st or 2nd time, but not good enough to increase. Dropping 40+ points for games I’ve only played ONCE or bested my score the SECOND time. How does anyone ever progress???

*EDIT: thanks for the response!! I was wondering if that was the case. I hope these “newer” games will come up more often to better my scores. Still, a very fun app. Use it every day!!Last January I was unfortunately diagnosed with a brain tumor. Glad to say I’ve fully recovered. My first clue into the fact that something very wrong was going on with my cognitive abilities were my Peak scores. They quite steadily were declining. They’re back to pre-tumor levels, I’m glad to say but I will always find it fascinating that truly, this game was telling me something was very wrong.I didn’t realize how I was basically just sitting at home rotting my brain out I felt so bad when I compared my score to other people my age and every since I started playing I’m doing way better in real life I’m thinking more ahead I’m getting work done faster I’m focusing better at school for some reason this app is changing and I recommend you try itThe only reason why I didn’t give this app a five star is because of the game jump control. It keeps thinking I’m not keeping my fingers down when I am and penalizes me. This game needs to be reviewed and the glitches worked out. 

No I’m not moving my fingers around while they’re on the screen. 
No I’m not pressing too lightly. 
I even tried being as still and careful as I could. Still kept saying my fingers weren’t on it and made me get a terrible score. There are times when I get a zero because it literally thinks I’m not touching the screen when I am. 
I’ve been using this app for a long time and I never used to have this issue before. 

It’s too sensitive now.So far Peak seems to be similar to Luminosity without really adding any new dimensions. The game selection in the free version is very limited. If I lose interest before the end of the week I will not buy the pro version. EDIT: I’m hooked and on a 28-day streak. I’m keeping my review at four stars because I feel it’s too expensive; unfortunately now I’m addicted.After Using Peak for a while you get bored because no new games are added. On top of it you would like to improve your scores in certain areas, but there are areas like coordination or emotion were you have only three games, so it is difficult  to improve the score or to train the brain which is ultimately the goal.Peak keeps resetting my day streak. I was going In Today to play my 12th day straight and it says 0 days. I know I only play for free but I would do the game if it weren’t so expensive. I really like it but totally frustrating to lose the continuity. I give the games a five star but took one away for being treated second class for not paying fo the full version.I love this App.  I limit myself so I don’t become obsessive, but a daily workout is part of my routine. 

A note for developers:  I’ve recently had two Daily Workouts which completed themselves.  Today when starting, all the games were marked as completed and gave me low scores for each game.  Please fix - my total score went down six points. 😢I’m not to pleased with the recent update.  I miss the round comparison chart and when you finish a game it goes to a blank white screen with nothing but the score.  Sometimes you have to restart the game to proceed with the next one in the daily challengeI was a legend for years at word fresh, babble bots, and a few others. Now, it says I have to rank up to be a legend. It doesn’t tell how to rank up, and when I get high scores I don’t rank up. The old version of your app was just fine. I suggest you revert to the old version.I’ve upgraded to pro on the yearly plan, however since then my friend using the free plan got a better score by far although I’m better at all game’s he could play. That doesn’t make any sense…🤷🏻‍♂️I brain train with my parents and it’s so fun! I don’t even really need to train (I’m 19), but the games make me want to keep coming back!

Some minor complaints:

Tap Trap: when the cards change direction, some cards that don’t even get all the way on the screen are counted as missed taps making it almost impossible to get a perfect score and level up

Grow: The achievements required to get a Master level are kind of ridiculous. “Submit all answer in the last five seconds?” That’s not a good way to play the gameI think it’s easier if K just list my pros and cons. 

Pros: 
  No annoying pop ups
  Actually seeing improvement
  Games are fun
  Many different levels of comparison
  Easy instructions
  Easy charts to understand 
  Challenging, but not competitive
  Positive feedback

Cons:
  Some games are missing from the score list (Word Hunt)
  Can’t edit your profile after you’ve created it
   The <19 age group is highly unspecific. Kindergarteners and High Schoolers shouldn’t have to be compared to eachotherI showered Peak to my young nephew. I could not find a ""guest"" mode. I lost 4 points on my score the next day, (although it was still worth it). But why no guest mode?It’s addicting to try and improve my score every day.  Only complaint is one of the coordination games Jump Control is in need of changing. It doesn’t work very wellLove the game but why is it every update wipes out my workout streak? And if you have to wipe it out, why can’t I earn it back? From 75 unbroken days down to Zero! Very frustrating!I hate that they want to charge so much for full program.

I’ve been training for a couple months now, with my highest streak being 41. I can actually feel myself getting better and better. My memory in everyday life is better, I can focus on my tasks much easier, I’ve started having a MUCH easier time relating to others, and my once horrendous problem solving skills are through the roof. I can tell in everyday life as I come to better solutions much faster than I normally would have. I only have two scores below 400 now (total score above 500) and I’m so very proud of myself. Looking at the progress I’ve made is astonishing. The brain is a muscle like any other. If you want it to be fit, you must train like you do with the rest of your body. I’ve done brain games in the past but lost momentum because the games were just not that fun and it was the same game every day. With Peak, there’s so many different options to chose from and you never really get bored. I do have a few games I dislike playing because I’m not good at them, but it’s easy to remind myself why that means they’re the most important to do. 

I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone struggling. My depression and anxiety have gotten much more manageable as well, but I’ve been putting in my own separate work for that on top of the training.This app is tied with Words With Friends in my opinion, both being two of the greatest apps of all time, & my personal faves...My only complaints are that I wish there were some sort of listings of Record Scores for each game, as well as some way to see the highest overall peak brain scores. The addition of those would really get my competitive fire burning hot...I also wish you could upload a pic to your profile, as that option kinda seems like it would be a given, and yet it's not. It would also be nice if new games were added a bit more frequently because each time one has been added, my excitement goes through the roof and I get motivated to hit legendary status as quick as possible. These are less ""complaints"" and more just the wants of a spoiled Brain Train Loving Brat... KUDOS to the creators, and Thnxx so much! The days I'm able to include some peak into my schedule are, more often than not, better days overall than the days I'm unable to fit a workout into. Keep up the good work!Peak is probably the best app I have ever encountered in the sense that you’re phone isn’t killing your brain cells but actually strengthening them. Peak creates personalized “daily workouts” customized for your brain. These workouts consist of a variety of games that not only make your brain healthier and stronger but are also very enjoyable and fun. You can also do a series of workouts designed for you (even one with the games you need to improve on). With the Pro Package, if you don’t feel like following a guideline, you can choose any of the many games they have to do on their own. Each game is designed to build upon a certain area of your brain. For example, there are games that focus on emotion, memory, coordination, etc. Some of the games are designed specifically do encourage positivity within you. There are also a few games for relaxation or fun without a time limit or a score. I highly recommend this app if you enjoy apps that don’t kill your brain cells, but are also extremely fun.Great games that are challenging, unique, fresh and seemingly always more being made. I like how it lets you know how you measure to others at the rank you are at, shows your progress yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and how you have measured during the game session if you replay, which creates a personal challenge to beat your previous scores, increasing the targeted brain/neuro skill. A major bonus is that there are some games developed by doctoral level researchers that help further develop data, that give you access to their published literature and research articles, to learn even more. This app has a free trial, and you will want to continue. Caveat is that it is pretty much unplayable once you have to watch horrible game ads every time you do something; the ones that last forever and you can’t exit out of, probably with some sort of king or person standing in the rain which a pointing arrow that nearly drives someone insane.To put it simply: the best games in Peak are some of the most dynamic, brain-stretching and FUN games I’ve played in any brain trainer. Low-Pop, Pixel Logic, Tunnel Trance, Rush Back and Rush Back+ are some of my favorites. 

On the other hand, some of the games make little to no sense for their category and are limited by whichever hand you get with the game’s procedural generation whenever you launch. I’m talking about games like Happy River which rely thoroughly on RNG to generate a landscape where your luck can completely change the opportunities you have to score higher or lower, which have 0 business dictating the average score for something like “Emotion”. Games like Word-A-Like ask for very specific word combinations (which you’ll memorize with repetition anyhow) and yet that game affects your “Language” category.

With Peak, you’re definitely giving your brain a workout, but take your recorded peak score with a grain of salt!After trying and paying for other brain sites, and tired of the fees that I did think were warranted I found this site. The games were more than comparable and instead of sucking your money out of you with no relief year after year, this app offers a lifetime purchase. I immediately took advantage of the offer. This is a premium brain game site for stimulating you and pushing you to use your brain in many different ways. You can replay games as many times as you like while trying to up your score or play others. There’s a huge selection to choose from so you never get bored, and so many ways to stimulate your - focus, verbally, visually, and more. I highly recommend this game. Invest in the lifetime for a cost effective and money well spent app.Going on my second year using the paid version. I do the daily workout every day. Love the fun graphics and getting me to think in ways that I might consider outside my comfort zone. Turtle Traffic has really helped me to focus and stay calm in stressful situations. I’ve never been a video gamer of any kind. I don’t like the pressure of time limits. But I see how these games help me to think more clearly and improve my memory so I buck it up and now I actually enjoy them - especially as my scores increase on initially low-scoring games... The only game I don’t care for is Happy River. I’m sure there is some science to it but I don’t see how it improves my emotional intelligence. But that is a very minor complaint. The rest is awesome and I’m happily addicted to improving my skills in Pixel Logic when I need some down time. 😊I have been using the app for almost a year now. The app is great! If you don’t want to pay a full price for the app keep using the app and they will send you deals where the subscription gets way cheaper(sometimes 50% off too). I have so far paid for subscription based games only once and it’s this app. Think about all the $5-$10 you waste randomly and invest that in your mental hygiene. App just doesn’t get more than >100K reviews based on nothing. Once you are a pro member you will love it.

To developers- Please add more coordination games and include other games in peak score too. I am on legend in certain games and still doesn’t count towards towards peak score.It’s hard to improve through a few language games because it’s hard to beat your score in word hunt or word fresh. I absolutely love these games but I feel like there’s a few things that would make these games a lot more better. More help on how to score big or to give more description in the games/ words. I tell my friends about this game hoping they will follow suit. This app is a fun way to learn and that is so rare this app should get more recognition . I have the pro service and enjoy everything I get out of it. I hope more people join so I can challenge friends/ family and even strangers. It would be cool if it gave out prizes for best player of the month but that’s just a dreamI am addicted to this app! I think it surpasses all the other “brain training” apps by miles! I do have subscriptions to Luminosity as well as Elevate. But Peak is the only app that has kept my attention. It has a great assortment of games to train things like memory, mental agility, focus, problem solving, emotion, coordination, and my personal favorite language. Peak’s games are diversified and so much fun to play. I can spend hours training. I love playing the different challenges to raise my peak brain score! If iTunes would let me I'd give them 10 stars!! If you're looking into purchasing a brain training app this is definitely the one to get! Pro is worthy every penny!!!!Had this app for months now and it’s very beneficial. I would recommend not upgrading to pro until a sale comes around though. Just one tip, the transitions between tabs are a tad chopping when finishing a workout. Adding some sort of visual growth to the pie chart(?) with your brain score or making the background react to the rest of the app would simply give this a slightly cleaner look and would allow people to actually see their growth day by day for those who have trouble taking information from graphs to charts or reality. Fantastic app regardless, try it out if you’re still thinking about it. There’s no harm.I rarely ever write a review, wether good or bad, but I’m really excited about this app and think they are doing everything right. I have been looking for “games” to increase my overall mental skills and while there are many, I love how this one provides you with such a variety. The games are motivating and fun, and I LOVE that you get instant feedback to your rating and how your performance measures up against other. Watching my progress and tracking over time is really neat to see as well. Thanks for the awesome app guys. Keep up the great work!I don’t typically play phone games, but I really enjoy The NY Times games and have been wanting something to stimulate my brain better. I’ve spent hours looking for decent free apps, but after reading the review noting the formerly gifted and burnt out status, it really spoke to me and how much more confident I want to be in how my brain works. 

The games are fun, sometimes frustrating, but the best kind of challenging. I also love that you see physical data points after each game as well as a chart tracking your overall progress.I wish I came across Peak a year and a half ago. After undergoing brain surgery on my right temporal lobe, this would’ve been a great recovery tool. It’s similar to that of the neuropsychological tests that are conducted post op which through using this app my scores have improved immensely each time I redo the test every 6 month post op interval. Only thing I suggest is to include a referral program of some sort maybe an incentive could be Peak Pro for a unspecified amount of time for each referral. 

Other than that, keep it going! I really think this is a fabulous app and idea!Played before in college against my girlfriend, we would compete to see who could get the highest percentile, ranking and score. Now i love the connect ‘em up. Specifically so i can force the computer to draw, which i feel like the game should factor in. I make odd ball moves so that it has to do the same. 

Also just returning after almost 3 years i think. Still best mind game and headache maker around.

Another also, i thoroughly enjoy when my attempts to make the computer lose end up making me loseI LOVE the new update!!! It’s amazing. This app has helped me in soooo many ways. It makes me feel as if my entire time using my phone isn’t just wasting time on social media. This game has all of the scientific backing to prove WHY these games work. It’s just all around A M A Z I N G. I play it daily. I currently have a 330 day streak! I’m a college student, and I have found this app helpful in improving my cognition, memory, emotional ability, every aspect! Thank you Researchers for this amazing app. It is free for a workout, AND you can Watch a short 15 second video to play any game you want!I had surgery last year and felt my mind was getting a little slow. I’m 56 years young and I started to get concerned so I began these practices. Initially I didn’t take Peak as a mind regulator, memory helper or problem solving mentor. Oh but it is and much more. 

I practice everyday and I can feel my mind being able to troubleshoot problems and analyze data much better than before. My focus is still challenging and I just checked it is also one of my lowest scores in practice. I don’t have the paid version BUT I’m thinking about it.

I heart this APP.I tried the free but for a while but the unlocks for the lifetime upgrade allow me to feel like I have more chances to be smarter. I’m not necessarily the smartest or close to smartest person with a score of 419 Rn but problem solving is my only percent under 50 with an average 83 percentile. Love the app longest streak was a 55 and if you miss a day it happens but you know you can train harder the next day with the added workouts and extra workouts and the whole 9 yards. Definitely the best $50 I’ve put into a game in quite sometimeI am 76 y.o., post 5 strokes and post Covid 19! So as you can see I have challenges physically, mentally and emotionally. Peak has helped me so much, once I was able to remember that I had it on my iPad! That was a good day even tho I saw a much lower Peak brain score than previous. I track improvement and can see actual evidence of new neuropathways being created. I am hugely encouraged. The brain is amazing! Thank you Peak! Now if I could only get this excited about my physical exercises.As I get older, I don’t remember things as good as I used to. I play this game daily, have been on a streak for a year and a half straight. I know I do better taking the test when I get up than after working 8 hours and then taking it. I got one of my friends doing this also. Keep up the good work. The only problem I have is I score high on one area really good and the score doesn’t go up, but if I do bad, score definitely goes down, don’t understand thatI’ve come to love this app! I was with the free version for about a week before I opted for the paid version. Considering how many games there are, I think the price is not too bad. There’s so many different games and if you find a couple you really enjoy, that alone is worth the cost. I do wish they’d provide more details on how I can improve my overall brain score, rather than just how to level up on each game. I also hope they add more mini games with future releases.I used to have a subscription but even without one you can get a lot from these games. I definitely noticed an improvement in my focus and mental agility over the period of a few weeks! The game’s are easy and fun and challenging. Plus you can play a lot of the games separately to hone your skills and improve your overall brain score. Seriously the games are fun! I tried some of the other brain games but this one is the best IMO.Have to say I agree with RandaRenee.  This is the best app I have spent money on.  It was pretty neat for free but the moment you splurge, the difference in the games and quality of them sky rockets. 
The only thing I do wonder is if the brain mapping is on track. I’m not sure how it can show such low scores in some areas but I’m beating ‘98% of users in my group in that particular ‘low mapped’ section?  Maybe I’m doing something wrong, I am still new to it all but be warned it is addicting. :)This app, especially the Pro version (worth the $$ - it’s for your brain!), has great variety of games and puzzles.  Some become very addicting!  I wish there were more coordination games, or that some of the games that are in other categories would be switched to coordination, because they definitely require some dexterity.  I also love the word search game, but wish it counted toward your score (it’s in Beta mode).  
Long to short -
Awesome!
Can’t wait for NEW games/puzzlesTotally enjoy these games and the increasing challenges they present as you work to improve your brain. I don’t like to spend any money on app upgrades but happily spent the low cost in this one to open some more options. I mean we spend more on a dinner out, but this lasts a whole year! I find that as I watch my stats I can even tell when I have not been feeling well due to a sag in scores. I highly recommend this app if you truly want to refine some cognitive skills.You really do amaze yourself with how many times you feel like you’ve hit your peak level and can’t get any higher score, until you do. I definitely noticed a change re application of these puzzles in real life situations.
With the family plan, I derive great joy from knowing the enjoyment both of my siblings and my grandmother gain from these puzzles. My grandmother loves strengthening her memory, and my siblings love the competition. Well worth the annual payments, for five years now.I love this set of games. The only complaint I have is that, from time to time, the daily summary shows a loss of points for game categories that I hadn't played for that day. Since I'm not that hung up on my rankings and whether my scores go up or down, it doesn't bother me. But it is the only consistent flaw I see in the app. 

I have found their support team to be outstanding. And unlike some other brain games apps I use (Fit Brains) they fix problems quickly.I have had this app off and on for a few years. I find it to be really nice because there are no ads and you can see progress in areas. Some games I really struggle with. I wish the app could point out ways to improve your score on certain games that I do poorly on, help me to improve on my weaknesses. I would recommend this app and there aren’t many I would totally recommend!I have been using Elevate for almost a year, and I’m very proud of my streak there. It’s a great app, where Elevate schools your brain and is very language oriented, Peak trains the muscles of your brain like focus and memory which may appeal to the broader range of people like me looking to harness more brain strength, and not as much brain intelligence. Peak also has more user interactions, a lot more statistics which is awesome and a great family plan you should look into!I have played this every day for the past 317 days. I can really tell that my mind has become sharper and faster in all aspects. I really enjoy it, and most of all, I enjoy competing against myself to out perform my previous scores. I have recommended this app to so many friends. It’s definitely worth getting the Pro version!Just recently got the pro version. The games are much more challenging than the free ones, giving my brain a really great workout. Scoring and comparison systems really keep me wanting to improve my brain score. After 50 days I’m still not bored by the games! And best of all I feel that it really does help sharpening my mind. Good job, developers!Love the app! Paid for the full version and I have not once regretted it. Though recently there have been some minor issues. Namely when I finish an exercise the screen tends to freeze when displaying my score, thus I have to close the app and start over. Hopefully you notice my review so that the glitch can be addressed.While at the laundromat or whenever I’m just pausing before my next task I can play my ‘go to’ word fresh or try to improve another game to raise my peak score. I’ve been obsessed with this game and after four or so years I can just enjoy my favorites. It’s fun to crack through a long time ceiling with a bit of effort.I feel that the variety in Peak is excellent.  The games are fun and well animated as well as entertaining. Great training for reflexes, problem solving, pattern recognition, brain agility, and vocabulary.  Just one thing, I don’t see “Moving Math” on the list of Games under Stats so I don’t think it is being factored into my overall Peak score.  Please check that out and fix, thanks!This is a great game. I love the variety of the games and i find myself looking forward to improving every day. My longest streak of days in a row was 87, that’s how addictive this game is to my brain. **only downside is that the last few days it keeps crashing every time i try and open it it just shuts down on me. Please fix any bugs causing this**I've been using this app for over a month now. I love how it tracks your progress. You can see which categories you need to improve on and the ones you exceed in. You can also compare your scores to others! The games are fun and they don't take very long if you have a busy schedule.I've tried a number of popular brain training apps. By far Peak is the best. The games change up daily based on my progress. The scoring of challenges is graphed out comparing me with others my age. I consider Peak one of my must do daily health routines. Highly recommend. Just finished my 366 day streak of playing!This is a great app for training your brain. I’ve been trying to use it as much as possible, but I wish there was a way to save or preserve your workout streak as I’ve been having problems staying committed to doing it every day and keep losing my streak.I’ve used Peak for a couple of years. While I do find it repetitive and some games are boring and unchanging, overall I feel I am keeping my mind quicker and sharp. I have noticed improvement as well as scores going up over time.I haven't paid for the pro version but I enjoy the free version almost everyday. I've used Peak for a few months now and I appreciate seeing my scores continue to rise. It's fun to compete and continue to get better and better, and I can tell I pick up on little tasks better than I used to.The little games are actually entertaining! While some can be tricky, a good challenge never hurts! It also compares your score to the scores of others, so you can see how much you can improve, but also how many people you’re doing better than! This is a great app and definitely recommend it!Great game, I play it daily and really works no matter your age! My only suggestion would be not only to add the other coordination game (NOT the Flame Dodge, the other one) to the free version and add more coordination games as well, not just those two! I’d hate to see my overall scores compromised due to chubby fingers!Love this challenge app
I’m on a 107 day streak
One huge frustration is the product tracking ads lock my phone every time! Some days I restart my phone after each game. 
Would recommend this app if that would get fixedThis is a great game that does exactly what it says. I feel like my brain is working better and quicker when I consistently use the app. When I don’t use the app for awhile and then play, I notice my scores drop a bit because I’m not doing as well as when I use it daily. The games are fun!So I’ve been playing for quite a while. Actually downloaded it for my 6 year old. I’ve learned a lot and I’m really motivated to increase my “peak brain score”. 

The only thing I could’ve done without was seeing the likings on 45 in PIXEL LOGIC (it was labeled as a “businessman”. Stopped me clear in my tracks.

Cool game nonetheless.love this app, wish you didn’t have to spend money on it. just to play and work ur mind but it’s a fun game. my family members and i try to get the higher score everyday. Doesn’t it matter what age group your in though? Isn’t it harder or less harder for certain age groups?Reviews are very honest about your strengths and weaknesses but also actively encouraging. Although some of the exercises seem very simple, they do require concentration in order to improve your score. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has difficulty with concentration.I love this app.  I play it everyday.  Since the last update it freezes after you get your score after each game.  So I have to restart my iPad to continue playing the game.  Please fixI’ve been using this for some time. I’m currently on a 123 day streak. I’ve noticed that I seem sharper at work and don’t have brain farts nearly as much. Also I have several friends that I got to use the app so we have our own personal rivalries!!Initially I thought I’d never see much improvement. 
However, after achieving the Level 10 Streaker Award for 300 consecutive days of completing a “workout,” I’m at Legendary for most every game and eagerly hoping the developers will add MORE games soon!!there is not a single game in here i don’t love. everything really helps get me thinking!! there’s a game called Smile on Me and i scored 100% better than all the players and it blew my mind!! it’s helping me find the things i’m good at and work on the things i’m not so good at. it’s incredible.I was kind of a fair weather friend to Peak until this last update. I really like the enhancement to seeing my status and next badges available prior to starting the game.  And I especially love the new streak! Now I can’t wait to see how many days I can get on my streak!  😊I love that I am having fun and keeping my brain strong at the same time. When you need a break from your day for a couple minutes, turn to this game. I also love when I’ve beat my previous score and see my brain map.These games are so good, I love them!! my scores go up and up and I play every day have for years. My son is 3 and he likes to “help” me when he sees me playing, so I’ll be having him play daily soon. Thank you for a wonderful brain exercise app.Challenging. Great concept. My peak score is slowly getting higher and I like that but I’ve Been using this app for a few months now and I’d like some new games added instead of doing the same ones over and over.Love the constant feedback about my score vs. my previous personal best—also love the benchmarking insights vs. other users. Winning requires a growing fertile brain! This is a great way for me to “play a game” on my phone and still feel I’m learning and growing as a human being.I play this game everyday. I try to play at different times of the day to see if I score better. I usually do better mid morning. This game helps me work my mind and is great for a little self competitionEngaging, addictive and fun. I love being able to see how I score against others game by game and overall against others in my age category.  I play this virtually everyday and some days on multiple devices!I have tried a few apps to challenge me, but I feel that this one is great because it tests me in so many different areas. I’m always trying to better my scores and it’s really fun to play.Love these games. Mom had Alzheimer’s and I’m always looking for a way to work out my brain. Some games seem a bit redundant but I find myself trying to beat my last scoreVery fun brain exercising game. At least 5-6 games in about 5 categories. With a lot of medals to win. I play everyday always trying to outdo my last score. Hope more games get added on.I enjoy playing daily, trying to beat my own high scores and records, and to meet new goals and challenges.I don’t know what happened but playing and scoring has improved SO MUCH.  Games are very forgiving and my scores are soaring.  Keep up the great work!This app has helped me re-sharpen my brain.  One suggestion is please add a section on exactly how each game is scored.  It will allow users to develop better methods to play each game.I really enjoy these fun game mind workouts. I start my day with them to get my mind going. It’s always a good feeling when you beat your old score. Never gets boring!Fabulous addictive app! Wish they can provide some feedback on how to improve.

However, some of the games are frustratingly too difficult and one game I just can’t figure out at all though I’ve tried.  They allow you to thumbs up or thumbs down a game but the thumbs down ones show up in your daily exercise plan and you can only change the game once per category so you a lot of times get stuck with another game you don’t want to play after passing on the first one. Minor annoyances though. My biggest frustration is that this is obviously created with Great Britain English vocabulary vs American which is vastly different. Actual American English legitimate words that would win in scrabble aren’t allowed in word games and so many GB English words are referenced that you would have to know their forms of vocabulary to do well in some of the games (words like pram that many Americans don’t know but are in the Word Alike game). Games also are stagnate. Dropping a newer game once in a while would be nice.*edit* a couple years later, and a major time away I redownloaded this app. Now I see that whether I want it or not, I get inundated with ads unless I want to spend spend the money on it, which at a one time cost I’d be fine with but not a subscription. 

Also, no redos whatsoever is ridiculous, especially when you have to do a few because the tutorials for the don’t even make sense. Yeah I get it free version is just a tease to get you hooked, but no redos? At all? Not as brain training as it used to be.*endedit*

Overall this is a great program. Great interactive touch, and really good about giving you goals to shoot for and constantly advance yourself. I only have a couple problems with it. 

Right now there is a problem with how the ""word path"" game in it is done, quite often giving letters that don't add up to words, or words that aren't in the game database as well. Along with this, it will lock letters in place even when there is no plausible options. This portion of the app needs to be looked at, as well as there needs to be a big update to the apps word database, seeing some how there a several common words that it does not recognize as such.I worked very hard to get a 500 Brainiac score and the minute I achieved it, after 200+ days, I went to see my pixel score and boom they’d updated to 600. No satisfaction whatsoever. Hard to compete with someone moving the goalposts. I’ll be leaving when my subscription is done. Now I just play around without any goals, might as well be solitaire.Enjoying the challenges one week after downloading, but has been crashing more often last two days.
Otherwise, the free version offers just enough variety of games and goals to be engaging.
Needs at least one update to address crashing.These games are really fun and they feel productive to your goals in the app. However, I felt pretty duped by their subscription service. (Oh the irony.)

I am a little skeptical of the rankings, but perhaps I’m overthinking it.

The games for the most part are intuitive, however they have finer points to them and it’s not always clear how to play or what the main focus is. For the game Grow I am still unclear if I need to order my words from shortest to longest to maximize my score 🤷‍♀️

Einstein probably would have sucked at this game lol and still gone down in history as a genius ;)The games are kinda fun, but the idea of a month subscription... to play games seems idiotic. A one time fee is more that sufficient.
They get you thinking it’s good to pay because you’re strengthening your brain, but the reality is... you’re playing games (which may or may not help keep your mind fit) and they are just keeping stats a little better than the other games you play, and putting you in categories. The monthly payments is such a scam! Surely it doesn’t cost them THAT much to develop in order to justify monthly payments? Anyway, long story short. I’m deleting it!Be careful — the app arbitrarily stopped recognizing my login credentials and all my history disappeared from my iPad, but is on my iPhone 7, which is pocket-size and too small to play on.

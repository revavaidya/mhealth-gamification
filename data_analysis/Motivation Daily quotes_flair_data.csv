One thing I don‚Äôt like about this app is I continuously have to ‚Äútap to keep getting reminders‚Äù. I‚Äôve noticed lately the notifications will stop coming and not even remind me to tap, tap, tap. Fortunately I don‚Äôt get a lot of notifications so I can quickly tell when I need to press on the app to make sure I keep getting these motivational quotes! I‚Äôve also noticed they don‚Äôt even come every hour like I scheduled it to. I‚Äôve already paid my subscription for the year so I guess this is something I‚Äôll have to deal with, but I definitely think I will look into using other apps that don‚Äôt need me to constantly check to get what I paid for.

Update: I wrote my initial review on Monday and by Friday I got a reminder to keep tapping. i feel like this whole tapping thing once a week can be for people who have the app for free. if i paid for the subscription i shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about making sure i get the notifications everyday. if i didn‚Äôt ask for them to stop coming then keep sending!

Update #2: Even though I tapped on the notification to keep getting the reminders they still stopped! It‚Äôs another Monday and I had to click on the app itself to start it over. I guess it‚Äôs better to click on the app itself than click on the notification to be sent to the app. It‚Äôs weird.This app is totally five stars but by the 2nd-3rd week of continuously resetting reminders just to get the quotes you love is annoying.

I would disagree that this app offers nothing for free. I personally really enjoy all of the features that I‚Äôve gotten from the app. 

As an aspiring minimalist the new black and white theme is perfect. After picking what categories of quotes I want and setting up notification schedules I find that the app serves my needs well. I usually begin and end my day with a quote notification and save the ones I really enjoy. After setting up the app I see no reason to continuously go back and fiddle with it except for changing the notification times. 

As for the premium features they‚Äôre nice but not what I want to spend money on right now but for free I am more than satisfied with the app. 

I think individuals needs a realistic expectation of what to expect for ‚Äúfree‚Äù in an app and understand that apps take a lot of work to develop. We have $1000 cell phones in our pockets but fuss at the thought of spending a minuscule fraction of that cost on apps that genuinely increase the functionality and the fun of these portable computers we now all carry.This application has helped me from the day I downloaded 2 weeks ago and I use it daily.

The quotes on this app are vapid, pop culture and tween focused bits of nothing. In addition the app is very inconsistent, you are allowed to set scheduled quotes, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to work or last long. Finally the creators of this app clearly feel the need to press there own political and social messages, rather than presenting a well rounded sample of world views in there quote selection. After more than a week of not receiving a single quote (despite being scheduled for daily quotes) I was sent one by now Elliot Paige, only a day or so after declaring that she is now a man. There is nothing wrong with the quote or Paige, rather this is cheap virtue signaling. In other words, this app feeds quotes that say you need to be Woke AF and will clearly prioritize people they see in that light like Elliot Paige. So, my advice, spend you mental energy wisely, and on a better app than this.For some reason the app doesn‚Äôt allow you to listen to your music on full volume when you‚Äôre using the app. I do fitness training every day so I post daily quotes on my social media which I try to get most of them from this app. I‚Äôm up at 4 AM getting the gym ready and listening to music trying to be pumped up but while I‚Äôm looking for my quotes, my music volume is turn down all the way or cut off completely.

Sometimes I would look at it whenever I felt like I didn‚Äôt know what to do in a situation regarding my life, future, however you may call it‚Ä¶.but I can say that this is a good app for anyone who may be drifting through motions of sadness, self-doubt etc. Now there are many quotes here in which I believe were gathered throughout history that many famous & influential people, personalities, individuals across all nationalities, religions etc. who were by societal norms successful and contributed in their own lives in a different manner to their personal circumstances and areas of focus. 

Regardless, they still rose above any obstacle that may have encountered in their path because we all need help regardless of how we may view ourselves at any moment. This is just my own personal opinion of what I believe is a very good approach for self care in this regard. Now that‚Äôs not to say that there are also many alternatives like books, community, human connection or other social interactions & hobbies to name few. But for those who may have trouble understanding how they might feel in relationships, life, where they may fit in this huge world, isolation along with loneliness and depression can swallow them up but I would like to say that I‚Äôm at least thankful for the support and encouragement. Thank you.Huge ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù to the Devs for creating this app! I started out with just the free version to see how much I liked it - and even that was entirely sufficient! However, decided to go Premium when I saw all the additional perks that come along with it - and that I must say is EVEN MORE worth it!You can absolutely create this app and manage it two I help you in all sorts of facets of life the good the bad and sometimes the ugly. Plus, the ability to add teams and then change fonts and then share it with your friends and family membersEither via Facebook or other social media or through a text message, what a great thing to be able to share a positive message with someone. Or better yet what a great thing to be able to find some thing to say to someone when you just don‚Äôt have the words to say yourself, just buy clicking one topic in clicking the thousands of quotes available until you find exactly what you want to say!!Not to mention the fact that you can even add your own so if you have a favorite saying of yours that you want to pop up on your widget, then you can put it in the app and time it to come up whenever you want to becauseThey give you the ability to set reminders for clothes whether it be three times a day or minute to minute. This is an awesome app and so grateful for it each and every day. Thanks so much!!!!Potential users, you will not be disappointed! ...and I‚Äôd be shocked if you were.  This app has come in SUPER clutch so many times. Whether it‚Äôs a motivation quote I go to the app and seek out or if it‚Äôs a pop up notification on my home screen. ..which I‚Äôd swear my daily notification I get each morning is always just what I need & right on time.  This app has quotes and sayings for seemingly EVERYTHING... even if I want to throw up a little motivational ‚Äúshade‚Äù on my social media without being totally rude.... I‚Äôve found exactly what I‚Äôve needed through a funny quote. LOL!!  I‚Äôm pretty sure I use this app daily and absolutely love it.  I refer friends to it all! the! time!

SN: I just read another review - I second the statement about being able to see the same quote when I open the app as I see on my notification without having to go through the notification.  I‚Äôve had that same thought but is by no means a complaint, this app is amazing!!There is a reason why this app is #1 under Health and Fitness. It generates the perfect quotes you need in your day that are motivational, funny, and are really up to you based on what you choose from the categories feature.  

The amazing thing is, you don‚Äôt need even need Motivation Premium unless you really want specific categories of quotes to appear on your feed. There are already fantastic themes and backgrounds and you can save quotes as favorites or share them to social media. I ended up purchasing Motivation Premium a few weeks ago, and it definitely has been worth it. As a college student, I deal with lots stress academically and some days I feel like a zombie in the morning. But when I pull up Motivation and read some inspiring quotes, I feel better than ever, and I hope this app will do the same for you!I‚Äôm not the kind of person to leave reviews like this, but I can‚Äôt help but think that this app is the best one out there. It has a sense of connection you feel.  You can pick your topic on what you want a quote on and it will give you one without hesitation or you can enable notifications and it will send a quote every hour. This game is used for meditation, anxiety, stress, and deep breathing. You can get this app for free and NO ADS. If you want a good app and need meditation or anti-stress this is the app for you. There is a reason that they call this app motivation, they hope that they will give you a quote and you will write it on paper or on your mirror so that you can  memorize it and make it fit into your life. This app fits all genders too.Several months ago is had a conversation with MonkeyTap. They are great people. They truly care about the apps that are developed and how they can help in people‚Äôs mindfulness and mental health. Each of their apps is designed with a purpose to enable people to expand their cognitive abilities and development. I use Motivation and Vocabulary everyday. They are customizable and have a large amount of good information. I post directly on social media and save images to share with friends from the app with works seamlessly. 

Thank you P & P! (I didn‚Äôt want to put your names up without your permission). Y‚Äôall are doing great and helping many people!I always think ‚Äúit‚Äôs just me‚Äù. It‚Äôs just me who‚Äôs not happy. It‚Äôs just me who can‚Äôt think positive. It‚Äôs just me who is struggling with this negative obstacle. I have deleted every social media within the past year and I keep having these urges to tap on an app that‚Äôs no longer there. My therapist informed me of using this app because my negative thoughts are more powerful than my good ones right now. And let me tell you, I‚Äôm getting addicted to tapping on this app and reading motivational, supporting, kind, words that my mind won‚Äôt say on its own. Soon I feel these words will come naturally with this help I have.Great app love it! Seems like the quotes I get daily have some kind of connection to what is going on in my life at the moment and definitely helps reading all the positivity. Only thing that sorta bugs me is when I receive the notification on my Lock Screen sometimes the quotes are to long and I‚Äôm unable to finish reading the quote then when I click on it to open the app it shows me an entirely different quote..but other than that really do love this app.This app is a must have for all the generations of people. The people who work for this app are super positive, spiritual, kind and concerned about the bad this social media is doing. Please it‚Äôs a humble request to download this app and spare few seconds of the day to spend on this. This is a humble request from a successful IT professional and a die-hard fan of a Yogi from west i.e US üôÇüòáüôèThis is the best quote/motivation app that I‚Äôve ever downloaded. It has such great quotes that I really relate to. AND you can share them with other people and on your socials. When I look at apps to download, I always look at the reviews and there is always such confusing reviews about the apps, but you can trust this review fully.This app is great!! It gives you so many different perspectives on how to motivate yourself and stay positive. There's also many different subjects to choose from if you don't really need motivation. It can also help you deal with mental illness, inspiration, stress, social anxiety and more.

I have it set mornings, afternoon & late evening to give me that little pep talk throughout the day. I am a female business owner, and there are days that can be a little more tough than others. I may doubt myself, or feel like I may never reach my top goals, but every time I see a quote, it lifts my spirits and reminds me that I am doing well.  Whatever self-doubt I can feel sometimes goes away with just a couple of motivation pick-me-ups. Even when I‚Äôm having a wonderful day, it gives me that feeling like ‚ÄúGreat! I‚Äôm amazing!‚Äù...I especially like that I can add them to stories on Facebook and Instagram or my Instagram feed to share with others. I have seen people in just the past week REPOST the quote I shared, because it spoke to them & helped brighten their day. That‚Äôs the best feeling!!! Yes, it‚Äôs awesome to be able to boost my mood, but if it helps others...that makes it totally worth it!  I have had this app for at least 5 or 6 months, and it‚Äôs one of the few paid apps I won‚Äôt ever cancel.  So, ty!!! This app not only helps those who subscribe, but others as well...maybe they will end up subscribing too!This app has truly helped me stay motivated and focused on achieving my goals while keeping up with it. Not to mention I‚Äôve been a lot more productive with my day. I have not felt so complete with an app before, as soon as I wake up or right before I go to bed I‚Äôm greeted with a motivational quote or just a statement least to say it‚Äôs my favorite way to start and end my day. I will be using this app to my full advantage as it has helped me in so many aspects.I look forward to my daily motivation at 10 every night. Night time when it‚Äôs quite and it‚Äôs just you with you is when internal negative talk occurs the most. It‚Äôs nice to always have a reassuring piece of inspiration to change my thinking, which changes my actions, which molds my character making me a person that can stay strong through the process of achieve my ultimate goals.I love this app so much. I‚Äôve been really hard on Myself, and I scroll to read these quotes and I really believe in it and I‚Äôve thought about more positive thoughts the first two days of having the app. If your the kind of person that needs help with anxiety, depression, relationships, setting goals, etc download this app right now!<3I enjoy waking up to these amazing quotes. They get me fired up each morning and I can‚Äôt wait to forward them on to my colleagues. Being able to set these quotes to pop up during the times of the day when I feel I need them most have helped me maintain my focus and push thru to my goals. 

Thank you.This app helps me everyday. Whenever i‚Äôm feeling down or need a little motivation I can always come to this and it‚Äôs like a spark has lit in me. This app encourages me to push harder and meet my goals. Would be nice to have a couple more free topics, but overall amazing app, very happy.The Motivation App is what I‚Äôve needed for years. It helps motivate me to continue on my goals. Every step of the way since I downloaded this app. It has increased my motivation 10 fold.

Sometimes I would look at it whenever I felt like I didn‚Äôt know what to do in a situation regarding my life, future, however you may call it‚Ä¶.but I can say that this is a good app for anyone who may be drifting through motions of sadness, self-doubt etc. Now there are many quotes here in which I believe were gathered throughout history that many famous & influential people, personalities, individuals across all nationalities, religions etc. who were by societal norms successful and contributed in their own lives in a different manner to their personal circumstances and areas of focus. 

Regardless, they still rose above any obstacle that may have encountered in their path because we all need help regardless of how we may view ourselves at any moment. This is just my own personal opinion of what I believe is a very good approach for self care in this regard. Now that‚Äôs not to say that there are also many alternatives like books, community, human connection or other social interactions & hobbies to name few. But for those who may have trouble understanding how they might feel in relationships, life, where they may fit in this huge world, isolation along with loneliness and depression can swallow them up but I would like to say that I‚Äôm at least thankful for the support and encouragement.

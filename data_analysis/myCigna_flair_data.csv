I can’t even get my insurance cards off of here. I probably am going to get rid of CIGNA all together. I’ve been paying my insurance for the last three months and I can’t even access my insurance cards to go to the doctors. I’ve tried it on the website. I’ve tried it on the app now I feel like I’m just wasting my money. Don’t waste your time with this app. It is the worst app ever!!! I went to a health fair, and the CIGNA rep couldn’t even access my insurance cards on the app or the website I also contact CIGNA through the website as well as the app and never got any feedback from them. I downloaded this app 10 times still no change. The rep said maybe it’s just a glitch. Whatever it is I’m done with CIGNA.The app is often slow and one can deal with that but customer support AKA personal guides have been 0% helpful, only if I could rate or give them feedback, I can’t because neither the app nor the support will let you do that. 
Takes them weeks to provide approval for MRI, often to be simply denied even when specialists order it, Personal Guide Shelly will say “2 business days call tomorrow to check” while next day Jeph will say “sorry I understand but it takes 5-7 business days” 
One can assume they’re just being dishonest, and probably employ “wear them out” tactics to save money and deny care that’s needed urgently.Vision ID card throws an error as I am trying to open and add it to my Apple wallet. I use iPhone6s , iOS 12.3.1. It works fine on web.
There is no feedback or message option to submit my feedback about it.
Chat option doesn’t work too as it throws an error after I type a message and hit send.
My husband is running into the same problem with vision card on his iPhoneX, in addition to that he can’t even add any of these cards (medical, dental, vision) to his Apple wallet. 
I hope this review helps your app performance.I’ve used this app for awhile now without issues. But I tried to login just now and get a black screen. Tried updating the app and same issue.

None of the features work and all I get is a “oops, something went wrong”. The live connections with Physicians let’s you set up appointments, but doesn’t tell you that you have to download a third party app until it’s your turn in line to speak with a doctor and you only have 2 minutes to do it and of course that isn’t enough time because the third party app asks for all types of information, so you end up missing your appointment you’ve been waiting hours for. This app is trash, don’t use it. You’re better off going to an urgent care because this app will have you doing all sorts of random stuff EXCEPT for the actual appointment you signed up and paid for. RIDICULOUS!Stop making us update the app in order to access our ID cards!

It's frustrating that I have to have to update the app just to display myID card. When out of Wi-Fi range and cellular connection is poor, having to download 100+ megabytes just to use the app to display an ID card is ridiculous. 

I was at a new pharmacy today picking up my prescription when the pharmacist asked me for my insurance card. I pulled out my phone and tried to bring up the CIGNA app, the first thing I encounter is The update app message. I must've spent about 15 minutes waiting for the app to download due to poor Internet connection. 

I also added my ID card to my Apple wallet but there seems to be missing information from the card on my Apple wallet as well. So that didn't help either.If you need support on this app you must give your social security number to an outsourced call center with no consumer protection. This company does not care about our security or American Jobs.
Update:Also, when you leave a bad review they contact you every few days asking you to take down the review. The goal being to annoy you. Luckily i have an email filter that has removed over a dozen emails of them asking me to “update” my review. Shady.When I enrolled I have different addresses for my dependents (divorcee) but in spite of that all the things are being mailed to me, like their ID cards. If there was an option to select to use the addresses I entered I missed it.

I’m any case, just wanted to thank Cigna for creating ever more things for people to fight about. Horrible company, horribly outdated technology…

And now for the app review.

Extremely slow.  Mind numbingly slow, even on a fat pipe internet connection.  Pages do not have loading indicators so it seems like it has loaded and it was nothing, but if you wait long enough eventually something may appear.

Please give us socialism!  I am sick of this capitalist health care.Each page takes 8-20 seconds to load. Logging in, opening my prescriptions page, before I even do anything. App looks well designed and is intuitive but is practically usable because of the slowness. I’m on an iPhone XS with great WiFi connection and speed, it shouldn’t be this slow.App never loads if using FaceID.
With password it can take minutes to get the app loads.

I was called this morning and was told that my eligibility was confirmed and my insurance card was on the My Cigna app. Not true. There was a card online but it was populated with out of date information. I discovered this at Walgreens after waiting in line and being told that the BIN and PCN numbers were in error and my six prescriptions would not be covered by Cigna until they were corrected. 

I fully expect that Cigna will soon correct their errors but I do not why they allow the application to post out of date information. Had they posted that information was being updated and a revised medical card would be available in 24 hours I would understand and I would have avoided a public discussion concerning the online insurance card and why it was no longer accepted. 

Cigna’s errors and omissions are sadly not limited to bad data.  Their supposedly professional staff (Rn’s not MD’s) are quite willing to debate medical issues with cardiologists and their staff. Ultimately the doctors rule the day but only after wasting time by the doctor, patient and pharmacist.  These issues are rarely documented in the patient’s file resulting a repeat performance by fresh Walgreen personnel who are ignorant of the past history and who are quite willing to further expose their ignorance in a refreshed debate.There is nothing in this app to actually find care. The care page is coupled with costs.

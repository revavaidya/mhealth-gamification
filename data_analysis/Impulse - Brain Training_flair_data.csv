As someone with ADHD I wanted to see if it could help as advertised. I took all the tests, did the daily challenges for a couple weeks, and enjoyed some of the games. 

What was really frustrating was seeing the advertisements and seeing tests only to go into the app and find that they weren’t there or results weren’t what showed on the ads. This was especially true in archetype tests. 

It is a decent app, but the puzzles and games I played a lot didn’t really get more challenging and this test issue seems misleading.",0,Advertised tests aren’t available,Jessicaleerose,Impulse - Brain Training,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,101,has_challenges,93

However, in the app they bombard you with deals off the premium subscription, they give you up to “96% off!!” Claiming it’ll only be there for a while, which isn’t really true. It doesn’t really affect gameplay though because you can still play some games, and you can complete your daily challenges without premium. My big issue is the tests that they have. Some include trauma response tests, IQ tests, etc. I wanted to do one, so I took the time to complete the test, and then only afterword was I told that I needed premium to see my answers… now I’m not here to beg to make the app totally free, but at least state a somewhere clearly that you need premium to unlock your answers. Or just don’t allow people to take the test unless they have premium. Anyway, that’s pretty much the only thing I have against this game, and all in all it’s been a great addition to my daily routine!!!

I really enjoy seeing how I measure compared to others so it gives me a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses. I let my son play the color connecting game- and I was amazed at how quickly he was able to navigate the game to level 10! Made us both feel really awesome. Very excited to see this platform expand. It would be great if there was at least an option for a free version where you could only play a limited number/ limited game access for those who do not have the disposable income for games but still deserve a mental health break.The challenges it gives you are both fun and challenging. I think it’s really cool that it shows you the statistics of each challenge to show you how you can prove and so that you can strive to try be a better version of yourself. The only downside I would say is that you need to pay for quite a bit as there are many ads and if you do the tests you need to pay to get the full evaluation. Other than that I think it’s awesome ❤️After utilizing the free trial period for Impulse, I had NO doubt that it was worth the purchase price. If you enjoy puzzles and brain games, you need to try the app that conveniently houses all the different kinds of brain teasers and brain training exercises in one easy to use package.  Like any other body part, the brain needs working out too, and this app employees so many different types of mental challenges and problem to solve, it's like cross-training for your brain.This app holds my attention because I control how quickly I can do each game. It’s really well-balanced with simple concepts and stimulating visuals, keeping you engaged. The challenges follow suit. The combination of these factors really allows you to enjoy these mini brain workouts.I’m having fun with this. Came in handy since lately (I’m 61), I’ve been forgetting simple things. Not sure if it’s the meds I’m on or if it’s something worse. So I started to seek out challenges for my brain to keep my focus sharp. Too soon to tell if it’s working yet but this is a fun little app!When you take a moment for yourself to keep growing with Impulse, you’ll find yourself on a mission to overcome the little challenges in a fun way! Quick lil games & quest for mastery keeps your brain sharp; you don’t become mush, complacent, or overindulged with endless entrapments of video games. 
4 stars is for cost $$$I’ve never been one for playing game on my phone but I love the thought process of the app. I love that it engages your mind instead of just mindlessly playing a game with no purpose. I also enjoy that the challenges are all different and get harder as you go!",0,Refreshing NoveltyI love this app :)Impulse AppOnly reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because of ads on free versionStumbled upon this little app…On a MissionThings that make you go 🤔,"wzxvvm:,oecruRabbitReal.Life.BarbiAndy Kotz/ AKMusic Productionsonly1meMisSaydeez",Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,501,has_challenges,93

Knowing how i am on a scientific scale has helped me narrow down on my strengths and weaknesses and has since improved my ability to connect with my family, friends and even in my marriage. Everyone I know has taken the personality test and has inevitably had the “Ahah” moment. Upon sharing with others we all say” well that makes sense. “ This app has fantastic games that are challenging, fun and really get the brain juices flowing as they get harder. I really like the diversity in games and the fact that they all challenge in different important skills. My favorite are the ones where you have to put a box together in your mind and be able to rotate it mentally to see all sides in order to be able to answer correctly. Another good one is the math challenge. Frankly for anyone like me or otherwise with the desire to see the world from multiple perspectives and solve problems with practical yet unconventional methods this is a great app to get short form challenges to stimulate the mind.I absolutely LOVE this app! For a long time, I’ve wanted an app with multiple bite sized brain challenges or puzzles to be able to solve. This app gave me just that! I love the Workout section (or at least the free workout so far), and although I haven’t had this app for long, I can definitely see myself using it for a while. I haven’t bought any of the subscriptions, but I still feel like I’m getting a lot out of this app. So, if you can’t afford the subscriptions but you still want an app like this, this is a great choice. I can understand that some people might get frustrated and or annoyed about the amount of ads, but compared to a lot of other games I think the amount of ads is worth it. Overall, I personally love this app and I would definitely recommend!This game popped up when I was looking for word games. Then I discovered it was a brain-challenging game for various brain functions, some of which I felt were declining since COVID and aging. I found my strengths and weaknesses while having so much fun. I played for at least 4 or 5 hours the first day (though I had some obligations to finish). I ended up buying the year (for now) and set up my randomized daily challenges reminder. With each game, I have improved and learned “secrets” to get the right answers as well as completing them faster through practice. There are also other interesting “tests” that may give some insight to other brain concerns, like stress leveling and IQ, among others. Definitely worth the price. Looking forward to my daily challenges from Impulse and improving my brain plasticity!With the many different test I have learned a lot about myself already. Things are spelled out, they are very easy to understand and you’re like…wow that’s right on the money but I didn’t realize this or this. There are suggestions on how to improve your mood, communication with others, your life in so many ways. It’s just amazing. And as we age we need brain games to help keep us motivated & moving forward at a great & steady pace, this app does that. The game’s challenges you in all areas of your brain & helps you to push yourself further all while telling you how you performed against your peers. I suggest this app to everyone. It is really, really worth your time & a great investment in yourself!!I’ve only used the app for a couple hours now and the way it challenges your brain is superb and it only gets more challenging the better you get while still being enjoyable. In this modern day and age where people have become so distracted and can’t focus on anything that does stimulate pleasure and enjoyment for more than a few seconds before they swipe up to the next reel this app is really a good refresher. I purchased the one time payment because I’m my opinion I believe it’s completely worth it and training my mind in this modern age will help me and everyone else who also made the purchase have an advantage in todays society. Highly recommend this app and I’ll be using it everyday!!!!!My father got me the app, Impulse to train my brain. At first, I was pretty confused why he gave us that app. I’ve been playing it since though and it really my brain out. I loved the app! The way things were designed, the challenges, the brain-twisting, the fun… I loved it. 

Now, I am a Middle School beginner and I forgot about the game six months ago and randomly stopped playing it. I saw my brother playing it and I asked why he’s on his phone. He told me he’s plying Impulse so I remembered… and I downloaded the game on my phone. It got better from six or ten months ago! Especially how challenging things are. I think the creators and developers have done an awesome job on this game!So first off the App is easy to use and gives you valuable insights on how your brain works. Doing theses exercises does help so try to test out how you feel/react throughout the day. In terms of challenges once you reach the max level you “can’t” restart to see if you can speed through the course. Which is a bummer because it would’ve been neat to try again from level one. Other thank that this app is Amazing in helping my ADHD and to pass the time while on work breaks. Keeps you sharp and witty.Was skeptical of another “mental training app” but find this to be a great alternative to blowing things up and chasing zombies games. 

This app makes you feel like your actually exercising your mind through the mini activities (games) but still challenges what you think should be easy activities (matching pairs no problem! Basic math no problem!) which turn out to be interestingly challenging.

I play before bed or while drinking coffee in the AM or if just passing time waiting somewhere to get to the next level. 

Interesting stats, tips and ranking against your age group make it even more involved so you see where you are against your age group. 

If you’re looking for something to stimulate your mid (because you think you’re always forgetting things or worries about your mental fitness I.e. always a forgetting things :) ) then give a go!I’ve quite enjoyed the memory games and the math games. I’ve only used it for two days so I don’t know if it’s improving anything but I think it’s really fun to do and challenges me to think about how to respond in these games. I also enjoy the tests that they offer I thought that was a fun addition to the app. I wish the test that’s you take would adjust your game recommendations and I wish they had a game recommendation section. Overall I think the app is great graphics and color pallet and all.It is worth every penny! The games are fun and challenging. It is definitely sharpened my brain, even lowering anxiety. This review actually sounds like a paid review or a bit review, I know. But it’s not. This app is actually, truly that helpful. If you have brain fog, anxiety, or trouble remembering things, USE THIS APP. Your brain will absolutely improve. I especially love the encouragement it gives if I don’t do well on a challenge. The better you get at challenges, the harder they get, keeping you sharp! Five stars.Impulse has countless number of different games that challenge your eyesight, mental acuity, innovation thinking, and it challenges the brain which I believe will help with mental disease prevention. One of the best features is that you don’t need to be connected to the internet. You can play a quick game literally anywhere you are. I highly recommend Impulse if you don’t have patience to sit for long games or that drag you into some deep story.I’ve been struggling with mental arithmetic and processing since leaving college, and have needed to practice to be more effective at my job. This app is both fun, engaging and challenging. The puzzles are unique, and the math challenges are varied in style to use different styles of learning and practicing. I don’t really like subscriptions, so I just decided to buy the game wholesale at the full price, which is a bit expensive. But to me, worth it because I intend to keep it to practice loving to learn again.I’m shamelessly starting off with a “That’s what she said joke,” but really, there are so many different games, challenges, & self-exploration tests such as IQ and personality, it’s a little mind boggling. I’ve been using it several times a day for about a week and I haven’t tried everything within it yet. I feel like I can probably delete all my other puzzle games without regret. 

I paid $40 for a lifetime subscription, and I feel it was totally worth it.I’ve been going through a lot of things in my life and now it kinda feels like when I’m playing this game it keeps me focused and relaxed. I know this sound so dramatic but I’m being serious, with every time I’ve been downgraded by others I find peace in listening to music and playing this game. It also really challenges you when you’re at a harder level. I recommend this game if you just ever want to relax or challenge yourselfI’ve only had this app for 2 days and already I’m enjoying the trainings. I thought it would be fairly boring and repetitive and I would loose interest in it right away, that’s not what happened though. The challenges are unique enough to keep me engaged making the daily training a pleasure not a chore. If you want to strengthen your brain you should at least give it a chance I think you’ll like it too.The challenges are a bit easy but that’s only cause I started yesterday. The app said they would get more challenging as I go on so that’s cool. The challenges are enjoyable and seeing how I stack up against everyone either makes me feel proud or makes me want to try the challenge again for a better score. I wish there were a bit more challenges in the daily ones. Great app to incorporate into your daily routine.I love impulse becauee I Lowkey feel like it helped me get my critical thinking skills back tbh, and for those out there who think it’s dumb to try and get smarter , or that your stuck where you are then your wrong . Because everybody can get smarter it’s just if you have supports , and impulse is one of my supports that I feel keeps me up even if I miss a day i still feel motivated to try and beat the next level, to do better on the challenges.The games are quick, so it’s not inconvenient to give my brain a little extra exercise when I have downtime. The directions are easy to understand to complete the challenges, and I also like that it shows your results in comparison to other users. Works other parts of your brain that you may not use normally on a daily basis. A worthwhile purchase to stay sharp!1. I’m always looking for little fun puzzle games but get quickly bored of playing the same game and puzzles over and over again which honestly most games on my phone last maybe a week before I ever open it again, this one is great because you always get a new game!

2. Challenges increase based on your own ability to complete so it won’t get too difficult too quick but for games you excel at they will increase the difficulty for that single game.

3. You can go in after daily challenges and play levels on any game you enjoy.

4. They are all games that will help with mental status, increasing multiple different regions of your brain and can be adjusted to however you want.It’s difficult for me to be challenged. Impulse is providing that for me in fun, adaptable, intelligence building ways! The games are progressively stimulating, and with the quick instruction video, I can be clear on how to play before the game engages. It shows how I compared to other users at the end of my challenges which keeps me interested in playing because we all know, that “I” have to be the best.It’s actually quite fun and entertaining. The fact that I am benefiting from doing these games, challenges and puzzles is awesome. It’s all about neuroplasticity for me. It’s helping. Slowly but surely, it’s making a difference for me. Plus, I just enjoy it, and I’m not one to like let alone bother doing “stupid” little games.  It definitely rocks! Didn’t think I was going to actually enjoy it!I have adhd with a iq of 130 this helps me focus when I’m not interested in what I’m doing while I follow the things I love as much as possible reality doesn’t work that way and as adults we have to do things we are not interested in impulse helps me preform at my highest level by providing me with the challenges I need to improve on the areas that I struggle with and helps me with games to keep my wits sharpI think exercising the brain is something everyone can benefit from, regardless of age, but even more important as we age & retire from our career. This app makes it really easy to do and fun to boot! I like the challenges to improve and the instant rewards and feedback. I also like the daily reminders to be consistent and the variety of exercises that keep it fresh. I highly recommend it!!I was hesitant to spend the money, but this app is worth it! The games are bite size and there is lots of variety. The challenges are satisfying and use different skills so if you aren’t great at one thing, you can excel in others. Graphics are good and game sounds are nice (not annoying and repetitive like some games). I can definitely see improvement the more I play.I really like the variety of games and challenges that provide the opportunity to test my focus, problem solving, memory and math skills.  The developer’s response to a problem I had with billing was excellent and the issue was quickly resolved.  I just hope that there are new games on the horizon so the app doesn’t get stale.I’m really enjoying the different challenges that come up daily. I am hoping to notice a difference in my everyday life because of the games. The games peak my interest and keep me intrigued. The free version has good options so I wouldn’t mind spending to get the full package because from what I see so far it’ll be worth it.I have had several brain training apps. This by far has been the most entertaining. After a while I loose interest but this app offers different game challenges daily. I also enjoy the option to play without purchase. I have not made that leap yet but every day I play I’m closer to making that purchase.Impulse is great because they give you new challenges everyday to train your mind, they also have different varieties of games to choose from. They have tests to see if you have ADHD, and others, they can also quiz your IQ, and determine your IQ class, so overall, this app is great to use when you want to train your mind.These challenges are fun and keep you focused, teach you how to focus, to increase your brain power.  When you think it’s easy, you trip up!  You learn about your focus ability.  Also, great games to challenge your memory skills.  Learn how to sharpen your skills in what you see in an instant, and then recall. Love this brain power strengthening app.I feel as though the app knows me by now. Like, when slack off a few days, then I get a notification on some exercises I just “know” I’m going to pass with flying colors. I pass… then I miss that one,but the interesting challenges and smooth transitions of the lesson/session itself makes this app that much more fun to interact with!! I love it!This game is fun if you are highly anxious like me. Just a couple minutes of playing some mind challenging games takes my mind off of all the tasks I need to accomplish in a day.. helps me to reset and refocus and be more productive … if you like quick brain challenges this is for youFinally a game app that is what it claims. I’ve enjoyed the simple games as they increase with challenges. I find myself getting back to this app when I’m in a waiting room or such places like the car service department to help stay awake 😉.  I’m older so I think this helps with speed/timing.I appreciate the app trying to accommodate each user and I really like that the app gives them challenges they can handle! 

Honestly, I’m not a fan of math— honestly if there’s a way to exercise the brain without using math then I’d be happier for it, haha. 

but I do like that the app teaches the users about the human brain. It’s very helpful!This is one of the best most competitive, brain improvement, challenges I’ve seen and I love the ability to compete against others and see where you stand against other people in the same age brackets. There are many IQ tests and other cognitive testing that is totally worth the money! Keep it up!After several rounds it becomes more and more difficult. The challenges are different therefore ultimately fun. Keeps you on your toes and you definitely have to think from time to time. I have not played enough to notice a difference, however I can already tell the game is helpful.If you have trouble with basic brain function due to high amounts of stress and trauma, this app is for you! It tests you on different types of brain function. It starts at a kindergarten easy level and then you work your way up to harder and harder challenges!I thoroughly enjoy the game it makes me think a lot more than what I normally have to in helps me process a lot of what I do now because I gave makes you think so much which is what you want and that’s why I really like this game because that’s what I was looking for something a challenge me in this game really challenges you.I just got the game a few days ago, but i really like it. I like that there is different games and challenges you can do. At first the games will seem easy but once you get on higher levels they actually begin to get challenging. Unlike some games where each level is practically the same.This app hasn’t only given me some much needed confidence in my intellect and brain capacity but I love the games! And it feels great to accomplish the challenges. I recently heard of these two nuns that lived to be 100+ but with the memory and recollection of a 20 year old because they would complete puzzles/brain games. This is my goal & Impluse is helping me get there. 🥰Apart of being healthy is not just a healthy body but also a healthy brain and this app can help with that. This app is full of fun and great challenges that keep you on your toes.  After  a few weeks I feel like a can handle the mental grind and have more clarity throughout the day. I recommend it even if it’s just for fun.The challenges are designed to exercise different parts of the brain and consistent practice helps me think and deduct ideas faster. Interestingly enough, I noticed a byproduct of this practice. Working on these exercises “light a fire” in my overall state of mind so it shifting me out of a sadness, depression or any lower state to a higher, brighter mood.Honestly pretty fun. Lot of games that were played as a kid but with a competitive twist that challenges the mind… or maybe I’ve just been out of school for a while lol but no still really fun, lots to do and I’ve barely started. I paid the one time subscription because I move like that. I recommend.Helps me wake up in the morning better than my coffee does it challenges my brain just enough to activate my thoughts on the morning and also calms me down when I’m upset I’ve also learned a lot about myself through the tests they provide love love love this appThis app is so much fun. I downloaded it for one game and I had no idea all the cool challenges it actually had. My favorite part is the random games it gives you but also the fact it ranks you against others to let you know where you stand. Want a challenge get this app!Love the challenges and the pace off these games! It is a much better use of my time that would otherwise be wasted getting sidetracked going down a scrolling rabbit hole of internet brain numbing nonsense. Thanks for encouraging good screen-time with fun games do t bombard me with pop ups, and spam!Very impressed with the huge variety in different quizzes to test your brain. The app is addicting though. I have began to look forward to new challenges everyday & love the fact it shows you where you rank among others. A++I absolutely love this game.. I have memory trouble a lot and this game helps me to train my memory and challenges me to really think about how to solve some of the problems.. it give detailed instructions if it’s a new game and it tests me in different ways and helps me be more confident in myself!!!The free version of this app is just enough for me. Three mental challenges each day; it’s quick, it’s fun, and it’s challenging. I wish there wasn’t such a long ad before each challenge but other than that, I’ve enjoyed the app!I really enjoy this app. It challenges you and keeps your mind sharp. You can tell that the creators put a lot of thought into how the mind truly works and what exercises and games would help improve the brains overall performance.The training is a mind awakening. I am enjoying it everyday. I really like the challenges, easy to comprehend instructions and follow. It’s a great mental keep up especially in my age, retired and less responsibilities since my kids are all grown ups. Thank you for creating this wonderful mental exercises.I am rehabbing my brain from a TBI, so I have since downloaded and subscribed to and or purchased a hand full of different apps. I must say this is perhaps the most clever and stimulating so far not a bad thing to say about these challenges and games and tests and on and onLove this app so much. I think it’s worth the yearly subscription, because it promotes self improvement each day. There’s many games and challenges. It’s also cool to see how you did compared to your peers. Definitely recommend!!If you want to push your mental training to the next level, look no further. The daily challenges will get the ball rolling and pushes you to achieve higher scores with each task. Absolutely love this appt and I highly recommend you download it.I’m really enjoying my daily challenges :).  At age 62, and retired, I worry that my brain is going to slow down.  With the challenges, and the IQ tests, I can feel good that my brain still works pretty darn good.  Hoping that with daily challenges, it’ll stay that way.Enjoyed the selection of challenges and the variety. It’s also interesting to see how my performance ranks amongst others. I do wish  there was expanded insight into the brain areas responsible for the functionality of each challenge.Many interesting games, puzzles, and challenges to build brain cells. It’s not as easy as I thought it would be. I hope I improve. This thing keeps track of your progress so we will see how it goes.Love the mental challenges of everyday use! Really is designed for your needs and can be utilized to work every part of your brain all you need is between 5-20 mins a day for something challenging. Best suited for Critical thinking skills and analyzing situations. Awesome!Impulse has a variety of games. All of which are challenging but fun. The additional quizzes for IQ and Left/Right Dominance are also fun and the results are interesting. Impulse has been a wonderful stress relief and I look forward to my daily challenges.Just getting started and I’m already appreciating the challenges. It starts off super easy and makes you earn your way to higher levels. Just as you would do in the gym.Definitely challenges my mind/ brain. I’ve been questioning my cognitive skills lately and coming across this app helps me think harder and test my brain!!  I feel like it can only help and improve my aging mind!Love the games and challenges they offer to help train and strengthen my brain. I have ADHD and the the quick mind break this app allows me to have is amazing and I wish I could have had this years ago!Not like other brain training apps at all!! I was pleasantly surprised and impressed!! The challenges are reasonable and not too long or boring, keeps you intrigued and wanting more!!I like to take my daily challenges during the day to stay off social media apps during down time.  Seeing my ratings against others helps me focus on the areas I’m weaker.I enjoy this app because it gives you a space to wine down but also challenges you in a healthy manner to where you don’t feel like you are not productive at all.I’m not a game person AT ALL but i saw an ad for this && totally fell in love !! it really does keep you thinking and using your brain in the best way. i’ve already bought the lifetime package and can’t wait for the daily challenges.This is a nice break from typical social media.  It challenges my mental focus and allows me to see my own personal skill level and where I need to improve my game.  It actually works the brain just like a bicep burn with a 12lb weight!I Love this app so much I have improved so much ever since I started it. I love all the challenges it gives me and I’m 13 but it’s still so fun and it helps me focus and do math faster and other things like that. 10/10 totally recommend.I like it because it challenges you to use your brain more than you usually would do. Giving you a good sense of what you want to improve on and stay focused and sharp.I am not much of a gamer in any fashion, but always love small little challenges like this and I find my every brain “workouts” to energize me in a way I’ve never really experienced before! I love it so much.This app is so helpful when you fall into boredom somewhere but still want to be alert. I feel like I’m exercising my brain every time I go through one of the challenges which are like games.Yeah, it’s just a good idea to get this on your phone. It’s not just a great time, but the challenges are fun and you learn a little more about yourself every time. Just saying, I don’t leave many reviews. This is a gem.Really having fun and some challenges while working out my brain. I have a brain injury so anything I can do to help keep my functions and maybe be better, helps.Very fun and creative way to keep your mind sharp. I’ve been using it for a week now and look forward to the new challenges every day! 10/10 recommended this appI like the tests, and enjoy the different types of games. I would only recommend they use the data and introduce new challenges and games as they learn what you needFound that using this app daily turns moderately strenuous challenges into fundamentally easy tasks. Simple 5-10 minutes a day has improved multiple aspects of my reoccurring mental strains.Great fun. Challenging. I love the levels. Keeps me on my toes.  Kids play these games as they are developing and they become sharp. Adults seem to forget about brain games thus they slowly deteriorate in memory skills. These challenges help restore some of that.Cheap as it is a yearly subscription. Really easy to navigate and has a bunch of challenges that are fun to play. Would recommend if your trying to become more intelligent and looking for something fun to play.My memory has been pretty bad lately. I wanted ways to “exercise” it. These challenges are fun and it kind of relieves stress in the process. I also like the option to pay once and that’s it.Love, love this app!! Usually I don’t play games on my phone and honestly never find the time either. Something said to try it out and I love it! Challenges my mind and gives me a since of clarity.Impulse brain training is an engaging and interactive program that I find highly enjoyable. It not only provides entertainment but also helps me sharpen my focus and prepare myself for the challenges of the day.I’ve done many brain training apps and this is by far the best.  It’s held my interest far longer because of the number and types of different games and challenges.",1,"The best app for a cognitive boostI’ve been looking for an app like this!Truly Addictive!Suggest this app to everyone!!EXCELLENT FOR TRAINING YOUR BRAINBest Brain Training App To Use!!The King Of All Brain GamesEnjoying seeing where I rankThe app is great!GET THIS APP AND USE IT!!!THE most entertaining mental game for non-game people!Fun and challengingIt’s so big 🤩👍👍👍Enjoyable trainingI really like it so farThanks impulse 🙏🤷‍♂️ConvenientPerfect gameChange it up!!Fun, entertaining and useful.This helpsGreat fun & great exercise!FunGreat variety of games and challengesAwesome brain gamesMost EntertainingImpulse is great!Fun to focusAwesome!!🙏🏾Fun way to get your brain goingOne game app that really plays what they advertiseDefinitely worksFantastic Brain GamesChallengingDefinitely worth downloading and buying!Best gameGood GameLove it!Love it.It’s an Igniter!Fun, Challanging, mindful gameGreat app for your mindFUN!!!Great App!Actually feel challenged!I love this game!Love the daily mental workouts!Total brain gainConnie N.🤩Amazing appSelf growth on 10!5 StarsFun!

First, notice that the tests have an almost hidden disclaimer at the very bottom of each test overview that states: “for entertainment purposes only.” I overlooked it so I took it anyway, and then at the very end they give you a sneak peak of your results and then ask you to PAY even if you’re already on a free trial. What a scam. I was excited so I paid for a weekly subscription anyway, but notice how they don’t mention this “disclaimer” on the purchase screen, they just do everything they can to minimize cutting you off the lead and take your money. I’d say it’s really dumb, much wiser would be being more transparent with their customers to build long-term trust and reputation. But this… this is no different from other mainstream “brain tests” and “exercises” you find on the web—where all they want is just your cash. The test result wasn’t even comprehensive, no mention what scale they used or base for questions. But my money is already gone. Obnoxious.Dissappointed. Cant see test results without paying. Think this should be explained prior to taking the test as its then a waste of time if you choose not to purchase. Wont be keeping app. Have no idea if the information provided/results are something I would value so no reason to subscribe. Should be better at allowing people to experience the app prior to purchasing to see if they like or not. Makes me think limited materials available/scam. Then, won’t allow you to send feedback without adding email. Also, if you play a couple games they offer subscriptions at up to 92% off weekly - like 56% a week. Don’t pay that up front price!First, there are so many ads I can hardly play one game. Second, most of the ads I’ve received are UNSKIPABLE. I have to continuously close the tab and reopen the app to actually play. The games really would be fun if they wouldn’t advertise other games and their own free trial every time I load into the app. It’s very irritating not for just me but for others. A lot of the good reviews are covering up the flaws about this app. It’s very upsetting because I was hoping for a game that actually kept its word. The ad I’d seen that made me want to play this wasn’t even an activity present in the app. Be real, this game needs a lot of work. Stop trying to steal peoples money and maybe people would download it and keep playing.I Downloaded the app a few weeks ago. Initially it was great but after a few days it was simply not moving to the following day. I haven’t been able to keep playing the daily games for a week now. I left a feedback through the app and no response, it’s been a couple of days. Right now I would say it’s not worth the money and feels like a trap and complete waste of money as the app is not cheap at all.
I hope that I am wrong and whatever is going will get fixed.",0,"Think twice before opening up your walletUnless you want to pay, you won’t be able to see if you actually like this app.The games are fun but the ads…seriously!?Stuck",Sergey Gutskobest use of my screen timetry me bio u mean122222226802/17/20,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,555,has_feedback,27

I’m aging, and interested in “so-called” brain trainers to keep my mind sharp. This is not it. It offers the same games over and over with no feedback on how to improve. It only gives you a one line, “you did better than X % of your peers.” How is that helpful? There needs to be more variety. There is one game that I particularly hate, “Arrows,” because I cannot get my touch on my phone to register and I always have to swipe several times on each arrow instead of once. It’s really frustrating.

 The only reason I gave Impulse two stars instead of one is because the tests do offer some interesting and helpful information. It needs a much wider range of more interesting games and puzzles, though.When I looked at getting this app, it stated VERY clearly that there was a 3-day free trial, after which my iTunes account would be charged. It also stated very clearly that to cancel this, it would have to be more than 24 hours before the three days was up. Got it. Check and check.  I figured with so many positive ratings, it has to be legit and above board, so I proceeded. 

Upon installation, it also stated very clearly that I could cancel in the settings of the app. Ummmm... there are precisely ZERO ways to cancel in the settings of the app. Zero. I’ve “left feedback” through there, but there are no account settings to be found anywhere in this app. Highly disappointed at the intention deception here.

While an app having a few boring games is to be expected, there aren’t enough total games in rotation to keep me wanting to come back.

Some of the games are similar to the sort of testing I had done during my neuropsyche. eval. for ADHD so I feel like that adds to its credibility of being a brain-stimulating app. I also like how they paced the increase in difficulty of each game. When you’re further along in a game you can give feedback on if the last level was too difficult or easy which adjusts the next level accordingly. The games definitely feel stimulating to say the least, plus there’s a bunch of em so you’ll likely not get too bored or just good at one game if you play with the intention of bettering your brain. 

P.S. the UI is very user friendlyAlthough I have only just completed my second day with Impulse, I am already able to see that I will benefit from following this program. Both my physical and mental fitness suffered while undergoing the rigors of caring for my Dad in my home during his last seven years, while remotely working full-time. I have been slowly building back my physical strength, but at 65 I don’t want to neglect my mental fitness. So far I am finding the program both challenging and encouraging. As well, there seems to be great kindness built into the feedback, something I genuinely appreciate and need at this point in time.i think this is a really good game and it makes me happy that they ask for feedback because it feels like they actually care about the people playing the games. I like that i can play this for free with ads but also if i didn’t want ads i could pay for a subscription. i also like that if they do include ads they don’t bombard you. the games are challenging but not too challenging to the point where i can’t play. it makes me feel accomplished when i do play a game and get it right because i actually have to use my brain to figure it out. definitely one of my new favorite appsI have been struggling with post partum anxiety and found a big difference since using this app… I feel so much better, I sleep better, and starting to feel like myself again. I also play these games instead of doom scrolling on social media which I think was contributing to my anxiety. Love the puzzles and bonus levels! Only feedback I have is would like more bonus levels and the option to only play the bonus levels in the puzzle section.I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. It can provide me with insights into myself and my thought patterns while also allowing me to work on areas that I want to improve upon within my mind. Additionally, the fact that it tailors its feedback to my specific gender and age is elegant - it's motivating to see how I stack up against others in my demographic. Overall, I'm finding it to be an inspiring experience.Great Way to Remember What’s Important in Life.  Simple tasks, games, puzzles to help anyone to feel more content and happy!  :)
There’s always room for improvement.  Education is key, and practice makes perfect.  
You can give your feedback about how the games could improve, as well if you want to.  Which, is pretty cool.  You do not have to be a genius to know What’s up!   It’s All Good. ✔️I think exercising the brain is something everyone can benefit from, regardless of age, but even more important as we age & retire from our career. This app makes it really easy to do and fun to boot! I like the challenges to improve and the instant rewards and feedback. I also like the daily reminders to be consistent and the variety of exercises that keep it fresh. I highly recommend it!!Right away I’m noticing areas I’m strong with and areas that are more challenging for me. The games are quick. The results are formatted in meaningful comparison ways that don’t feel judgemental, rather simply neutral feedback. I appreciate that aspect a lot. I’m committed to a daily practice for the next month to see what happens. 5 minutes a day for a fun brain training is an easy commitment to make.I’ve just started playing… And so far so good. It actually makes me think and do things that I normally wouldn’t even think about, but I can tell it’s very helpful and most importantly it’s fun and good for me (for my brain). I am of the older persuasion, so it’s absolutely important that I do things to continuously stimulate my mind. So far I have found just the game to do this…loving it so far.It’s so fun and it honesty makes me feel smarter. i love how it gives me feedback after every game on how i did and personalizes that game for me so i can improve! i don’t pay for the subscription and honestly you don’t need to it’s an amazing game as it is and there are barely any ads(please don’t change that). highly recommend!I downloaded impulse because I wanted a game that would exercise my mind, and evaluate my thinking and this app does exactly that. Impulse has fun games and great quick feedback. I love the simple design and the variety. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who doesn’t want to do pointless activities and enjoys puzzles!I’m hoping this helps with my reconnecting my brain function.    I’ve heard great things about this type of Neuro feedback and am hopeful this helps with the issues I still struggle with.  So far I’m enjoying this app.  It’s only been 2 days.  But I think I’ll like it going forwardI like that it gives you options of what to develop and the games are pretty fun! Quick dopamine release when you see how you’re doing well - also like the feedback in how I’m comparing to others in a similar demographic.The games in this app are really interesting—more than in other similar apps I’ve tried—and the UI (the directions, feedback, etc) have a sensible and friendly tone. highly recommended!This app was very nicely done. The games are simple yet effective, the tests are the same, and they ask the users for feedback on how to improve. I would recommend this to anybody that wants to improve themselves mentally or learn about how their mind operatesYou do have to pay like a fee like if you actually want to go continuously keep improving. I mean if your paying money on it might as well play it. This game actually makes me feel very smart, and knowing I can do it(:Find that these games, exercise different parts of my brain than the typical games that I have downloaded. So far these are short games easy to understand and I get quick feedback.App is very visually appealing and engaging. I love the games and the opportunities to give feedback, it makes me feel like they take the feedback seriously and want to make continuous improvements.

Then when i paid the 6.99 for a weeks subscription (again, after the app said when i signed up for the free trial there would be no payment during my trial) all the quiz told me was that it would be helpful to see a professional. To be clear, it DID NOT tell me my adhd type or ways i can help my symptoms like the ad suggested. it just said see a professional. 

VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL BE SEEKING A REFUND, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU CAME FROM THE ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS *NOT* THE APP ADVERTISEDI kept seeing this game and finally decided to download it cause I’m a puzzle person and was really interested! After getting this particular question “A man who has people working for him especially servants or slaves….” And the answer to unscramble be MASTER!! I deleted it and will never recommend this game! I will be posting on all my social media plate forms in hopes to have the maker remove the question, the games getting shut down, and have them apologize to everyone! I hope all races who believe in things like this shouldn’t be on here erase this game cause this is horrible. What if there is a smart child playing this game and they have come across it!!If this is brain training then so is candy crush. Slapping the title brain training on some games a child could play and telling your audience that they are ""better than 90% of their piers!"" is genius. 30 question IQ test, 25 question AHDH diagnosis.

After coming across Impulse, I figured I would give it a go. I have just completed the 30-day brain workout plan and feel real improvement now: it becomes easier for me to concentrate on the particular task and my working memory seems to be better as well. Not sure whether the same may be fully related to the use of this app, but I don’t care as long as I see results. I have bought the lifetime plan and consider this as a huge investment in my mental health.
Planning to start a new workout but not sure whether to go for 30 or for 10 days. It would be great to see some recommendations after finishing the 30-day plan.
Also, I enjoy solving brain-teasers a lot. Just a small suggestion here - would be really interesting to see how other players answered to brain-teasers.
The only thing I wish this app have is more training areas, like creativity, brain speed, etc. Also would appreciate more games and exercises (still, worth to mention that the developer adds new content regularly).
So, it’s a legit app and thank you for creating it.Been playing for two days and so far I really enjoy the exercises . I love puzzles and games that challenge my wit and strategy . Helps to unwind and relax my mind or stimulate and inspire in a positive and beneficial way. It has features also to tailor to the intensity of what you are going for mood wise . I don’t like games that unnecessary stress me out , but I do appreciate a challenge that motivates my focus and observation as well as creativity. It serves it purpose, so far so good . I recommend it. I enjoy finding patterns, connections and visual /spatial aspects as well as language and reading comprehension. Looking forward to the math exercises since I know I could really use the practice and encouragement to strengthen those skills.I’ve been living with anxiety and depression since I was 18 (mid 50’s now), and recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I’ve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.  

The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.

The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I’m fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.  

Highly recommend the app, and I’m looking forward to seeing increased results as I progress.Alzheimer’s runs in my family on my maternal side and I’ve found that as I age and near 40, regularly spending dedicated time working my brain muscles on activities unrelated to my personal life and/or work are what keep me feeling mentally strong and reduces the fear of developing dementia later. 

Of course, there are also many benefits now, years before I have to be actively concerned about brain degeneration—improved attention span, quicker processing, better memory. Impulse is great for those times you’d otherwise be mindlessly scrolling social media; the games are fun and the advantages are many. Highly recommended for those wanting to optimize their brain health!It’s fun, challenging and you get to see how you’ve stood up on each challenge to their user base as a whole. It’s much better than those meme quizzes you find on social media. It’s still new, so I don’t know this: it would be cool if it somehow integrated with social media such you could also be compared to people that you know. It would also be cool if your ongoing progress could be tracked to produce and show your iq based on your collective results over time.

Altogether it’s quick, it’s a quick easy and fun way to exercise your brain without any sweat…Definitely worth it. I paid for the year and I use it consistently for periods of time when I remember. There are many many different choices for games and it does help improve speed for making connections quicker I have noticed. It also seems easy for a lot of them, but they have enough levels that it can get difficult enough so you don’t get bored from it being too easy. I have severe adhd and I am hoping it can help improve focus. I need routine so this is an extra thing I have added to help. Love it so far!I have been struggling with post partum anxiety and found a big difference since using this app… I feel so much better, I sleep better, and starting to feel like myself again. I also play these games instead of doom scrolling on social media which I think was contributing to my anxiety. Love the puzzles and bonus levels! Only feedback I have is would like more bonus levels and the option to only play the bonus levels in the puzzle section.Impulsive is a pretty fun brain training game that most of the time I don’t realize is a brain training game. Most of the mini games are pretty challenging but make you really think(my personal favorite being the 1 line game.) mini flex, but I took an iq test and it said it was 125 which I'm pretty happy about seeing as I’m still relatively young compared to others with that iq. Overall, I really like the game and I recommend it to anyone who has too much free time and wastes it on social media.look meditation or picking up a new hobby can take up a lot of time, energy and planning to get your brain building and maintaining  new connections but this app will help you do that for a few minutes a day! With an affordable lifetime option, i’ve been using impulse (on and off) for about 2 years and i can see the growth i’ve made not only in the app but especially in my executive functioning skills!(real review- not sponsored!!) i just starting adding this to my daily routine because i want to keep my brain healthy. i’m a world where most of us are sitting in front of tv or social media most of the day, it’s so healthy to remember your brain and keep it sharp!! i love that they keep track of your daily streak and gives you a variety of different games each day. 10/10 for sureDeleted social media a few days ago. Naturally by habit I am opening my phone only to remember doing so. Downloaded this in place in case I needed something to fill the time when I’m away from my book and I love it. Simple games, insightful surveys. Highly recommend just for boredom alone. Excited to see the benefits after a few weeks.This app is great. It has everything to offer about your brain. What your General IQ is, what personality type your are, what side brained you are and so much more. There are SOME ads but barely any that would make a person mad. I really enjoy this app personally because I have ADHD and it helps me with my social skills and my mental skills such us memory and mental maths. Overall, great app and I love it!I used to be skeptical of apps like this that you have to pay for the subscription but it is entertaining for when you don’t want to scroll on social media, and after a few hours of getting lost in the games my brain actually felt very goodI’m not into games. This piqued my interest with the personality assessments, complimented by various games to spark mental activity rather than aimlessly scrolling through social media for hours on end. Each tiny victory adds up, and motivation sets in with relevant comparisons to others in your age bracket. Beware, it’s addictive!I’m just a couple weeks into using the app a couple times a day and it’s surprisingly entertaining, challenging and rewarding. Great way to start my day and also better than social media scrolling throughout my work day lol Telling my friends and fam to get Impulse tooSuper good for my brain and benefits me in so many ways. Love playing this game when I’m bored instead of just scrolling through hours of nonsense on social media that doesn’t benefit my brain what so ever. This app is awesome and I wish I had the money to play it more. Thanks so much for creating such an awesome app!! -samantha pate from YosemiteA better way to entertain your brain versus mindless scrolling through social media feeds. Sometimes you just need to shut off a bit, or focus on something outside of the ordinary day to day responsibilities. It relaxes me, and is beneficial for brain training at the same time.Just started, no idea if it will actually help improve my brain function, but it HAS to be better than scrolling social media!! 

The games are fine, tons of variety and difficulty and the app is soiled, intuitive with no glitches.Mentally kickstart your day the right way! End the mindless scrolling through social media or browsing the new inbox delivery as soon as your eyes open and stimulate that reality bending world changing orb of meat that sits between your ears instead. Really. Start today.I’ve been needing a break from social media and this app is serving as the perfect replacement during my 30 day detox — it’s  actually strengthening my mental faculties instead of dulling them. Grateful to have found this app during my social media detox!I am a bit addicted to this. I am enjoying it and I feel accomplished. It’s much better than social media and it’s a feeling of satisfaction each time I get to a new level! Highly recommend it.The ability to focus your thoughts or keep them at bay to achieve each mini goal becomes a true test of your mental agility!
Great tracking tool for your thinking improvements!
A purposeful use of time in stark contrast to the mindless social media apps!Really great way to spend down time instead of scrolling through social apps for hours! I can really feel my brain getting sharper after each exercise.I really like having this app on my phone. the games are fun and every time I reach for my phone out of habit I just open this app instead of spending more time on social media. 
I think the cost was worth it.I enjoy using impulse because the games are fun while also giving me a chance to test my knowledge and keep my brain engaged. It’s a better way for me to start my phone use for the day then scrolling on social mediaGood brain exercise for memory and something better to do besides just using your phone for social media …I think everybody should have this app on there phone it’s really beneficial and keep you on pointThis app has all the “brain-games” in one!  Keeps it fun and engaging while tracking your progress and increasing difficulty. Absolutely a joy to use. Much better use of downtime than mindlessly scrolling social platformsI like to take my daily challenges during the day to stay off social media apps during down time.  Seeing my ratings against others helps me focus on the areas I’m weaker.Have been enjoying the games since purchasing the app. Can get sucked into playing, but that better than scrolling social media apps. Wide variety of games, which keeps you challenged.I love this app because the short games fit well with my busy schedule. The app contains brain exercises that pull me away from the mind numbing social media consumption vortex, which is a very good thing. I enjoy exercising my brain with this app.I turned my phone black and white. Deleted all my socials. The only app i use when i'm bored now is the impulse app. 

This app honestly trains your brain and it's better then tiktok, snapchat, instagram and facebook. Why scroll on your phone for an hour when you could be training your brain. 

And for the people complaining about it costing money, Be grateful they charge $30 for a lifetime pass, they could've easily made it $50-$60 and I would still pay. 

Great app. 9.8/10This is a nice break from typical social media.  It challenges my mental focus and allows me to see my own personal skill level and where I need to improve my game.  It actually works the brain just like a bicep burn with a 12lb weight!I don’t ever write reviews and it’s really rare I even use an app besides social media frequently. This has me hooked and I can feel the improvement it boosts me mentally.
I’ll probably subscribe to premium soon.This is an intuitive app for stimulating my brain. The quiz starts easy and seem to adjust to challenge my brain further. I can certainly do this for brain health over than trolling social media.So many fun games that are free to play. All are unique and easy to learn. I started playing these games to help my social media addiction and now I’m addicted to this app! I’m not disappointed, considering on buying to skip the adsDownload this just searching up “adhd games” and this is perfect. I needed a new app to be on instead of social media apps. But also wanted it to be good and interactive with my brain. This is exactly that.This app is helping me get my attention span back after deleting social media! It’s been great to see improvements on the app and in my life. Highly recommend if you like personality tests and learning your strengths and weaknesses.",1,"The best brain training app ever!Great mental workout .

After a couple of days I decided to cancel. I figured they’d pro-rate me and only charge for a couple of days, or worst case scenario charge for a month.  Nope. They are making me stick with it for the full year. My cancellation won’t go into affect until it’s time for the 1 yr renewal.  I did not see any small print that would have made that clear. Bad faith, guys.  The games are ok, not great.  Some things don’t make sense such as how they keep track of your scores vs those of your peers.  Also the progress chart is not intuitive.I believe that most 5 star reviews are either bots or made by the employees. Similar to almost every app made within the past few years, there is little to no use for it without paying for a subscription. You can do any test in the app but as soon as you want to see your test scores, you get hit with a pay wall. You cant even use the app without selecting “free trial” and then you get a notification of a charge from apple. I believe this app is just here to tell you what you already know but only after you pay for it. This app is definitely just a cash grabI signed up for the free trial to test out the app. This did open quite a range of things for me to try out - it’s quite enjoyable. Among them, an IQ test. This was a 60 question/ 20 min test and, at the end, it gave a score.  I could see the score but would only allow me to access the report if I signed up for an ongoing membership. This immediately turned me off.  What is the purpose of a free trial if I cannot access portions of the app? What else would I have to pay extra for even if I signed up for an ongoing subscription? Immediately canceled my free trial.Yeah, I’ve had this app for a few weeks now, found it just searching through the App Store.

Since installing it I’ve been bombarded with ads on Facebook that are completely irrelevant to what is actually in the app, the final straw was an ad where it implied there was some sort of personality quiz that would determine your “Male Archetype” whatever that means.

Not only was said ad irrelevant to the actual content in the app, it was completely nonsensical. It was a graph with the different “male archetypes” with several personality traits that said “male archetypes” have in varying degrees.

I’m not going to go through all of them, but “The creator” “male archetype” had one of, if not the lowest score in creativity.

I have no idea what their intention with these ads are, but if it’s to get people who already use your app to delete it, then good job it worked.All of your ads talk about finding your brain type or adhd type or whatever, but not even one of these reports is available in the free trial. This makes your ads seem quite misleading.

Your response says ""Please be aware that on a free or trial plan, you will still have access to basic results only, such as your IQ score, trauma response type, archetype, ADHD type, etc."" This is not true. You cannot see what ADHD type you are without paying money.I just gave you $6.99 for a week’s subscription then you make me pay $6.99 MORE just to see my IQ score?? What’s the deal here? My head hurts because I did all that work for absolutely nothing but more begging from you guys. At least 50% of people download this app in the first place because they’re bored or sad…obviously digging in our pockets every other test/game is off-putting. I’m appalled. I knew there hard to be a good reason I deleted this app long ago.This app tries to take advantage of people with impulse control disorder. Everyone scores high on their simple IQ test, and their ADHD assessment is an absolute waste of time. It could only be considered fun if you like winning simple games to feel better about yourself. Be careful. The 3 day free trial requires a 24 hour notice of cancellation before they bill you, thereby becoming only a two day trial. This was created by a grifter who likes to prey on people seeking mental strengthening exercises.",1,Still have to pay if you cancelThe importance of reading negative reviews.Turned offIrrelevant nonsense adsSecond response - updatedGREEDY GREEDY GREEDYSnake Oil,Scoped00not worth my time1Cl1210TeakayjeelsalazaarYaTTaBai7373644889425478,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,769,has_tracking,82

The puzzle games were fun and engaging (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but the tests were a complete waste of my time. Instead of saying beforehand that you had to pay to get the reports, they had me go though all the questions only to tell me afterward that I’m order to see ANY of the results I had to pay. All you got was just a tiny glimpse of what it was at the top of the screen, without any explanation.
I mean, come on guys. You have three different IQ tests at different depths, you could have at least offered the basic one for free, or gave a small explanation of the basic results then have to pay for the more in depth information.
Premium isn’t expensive, per se, but I just have better uses for the twenty bucks or so that it costs.

With the games and puzzles that are unlocked in the free version, this app just isn’t worth downloading.
Only download if you are willing to pay.I downloaded this since I was quite curious and took the IQ test. However, I was extremely disappointed when after I spent about 25 minutes doing my test expecting the results when sadly, they force you to pay for the stupid Weekly or Annual subscription to see the full results…. (They literally only show the IQ score and I ain’t paying $8 for a dang “Weekly” subscription!) Why didn’t they say that BEFORE I took the test?! Now, I feel like I just wasted my darn time with this app! Pitiful and disappointing! I can’t stand it when companies do the stupid false advertising thing….I am truly upset. I just took a 60 question in test which I thought was fee but nope! At the end of the test it made me have to pick a payment option just to see my score
Like at least instead of making people waste their time for something they have to pay for at the end at least let them know they have to pay for it before hand.",0,Waste of timeForces you to pay AFTER taking testOutrageous,NachosbestfriendTetrisFan7MaddenIsRllyBadd,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,378,has_tracking,82

They are some of my favorite apps. This one is just ok on the brain training. One thing Indo not like about this app is the constant 99% score.  No matter how well I seem to do in different categories, the top score is 99. As an educator who specializes in success strategies, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Like the developers want me to keep coming back over and over to get that 100. I find this concept less motivating than beating a high score or something. 
Sometimes some of the games do not set up correctly. I actually paid for a year of this app and then requested a refund for this very reason. This challenge added to the low motivation to create a less than ideal brain training app. 
I would definitely compare this app to some of the others. If you want food archetype info this app will break that down for you. But the brain training is better found elsewhere.Frankly, this app is great for what it is. The games are fun, and the tracking is great. However, I was misled when I purchased a life time copy of this game. Perhaps I mis understood the nature of the sale, but this is a subscription service HOWEVER you can also purchase life time access to this app by paying a lump sum fee up front. I chose to do that during a sale they were having specifically for that deal. This was a few months ago.

After purchasing that life time access, I was STILL charged monthly for the subscription. I feel like I was mis led. Not accusing anyone of saying that it is a scam, but these guys 100% need to work on their wording when they say “life time access after paying this” but not explaining that you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee. To that end, buyer beware. 

3 stars cause the actual content is great. -2 stars because the way they process their transactions are mis-leading at best.I am on 110 day streak with the daily training. So safe to say I’ve been at it long enough to give this feedback. While most of the training games are good and even fun, there are some boring ones (pass the ball, arrows direction). While an app having a few boring games is to be expected, there aren’t enough total games in rotation to keep me wanting to come back.  

Would love to see at least 2-3x more games added for the daily workouts. Otherwise this isn’t worth paying for a year subscription because you’ll be bored within a couple of months.Look, it’s actually one of the better or best brain training apps. Fun, user friendly, extremely informative, content other apps lack. This would be 5 stars but I was under the impression that this was free, NOPE! Too bad though I like it. Especially how in-depth the information provided is, such as how the specific parts of the brain & their function. Also enjoyed how I was shown the % of “my peers” which I scored higher than after each activity/game.  Again too bad I was tricked into downloading it. Though it may be worth purchasing, if it were as one time fee, NOT A DANG SUBSCRIPTION!!!!So my first time using this app the games are fun and interesting but the ads between every game get annoying and their other apps very similar on the market for free where you can do three games free a day without any ads and the game already glitched out I was playing the ancient numbers game and every time you finish it. it doesn’t actually take you to the home screen or tell you what you scored it just freezes on the zero time left and doesn’t progressI really like most of the games, but there are some glitches in saving your progress.  I’ve had at least 2 games erase some levels I had successfully completed (yep, I have screenshots).  Also, at least a couple of times my streak was reset, even though I do the games every day.  Maybe I shouldn’t have paid all that money; I didn’t expect these basic types of issues to keep cropping up and to be ignored.Enjoyed it at first and felt the subscription was worth it. Ultimately got bored of the repetition and got a little lazy so I let it sit for a while. 

Finally got back to it and the daily puzzles were among my least favorite. Either way, I didn’t finish all 5 games, thinking it would reset the next day. 7 days in a row and it’s still the same 5 games. Over and over. 

I get that there’s a training aspect and I’m
probably getting these games because I score lower on them but sometimes it’s because I don’t care enough to focus. No amount of motivation will get me to apply myself when swiping arrow directions.

Canceled my subscription.See, ads themselves are okay, but when i am on a streak in connect the dots and an ad pops up i get soooo mad! Tips that should be added, less ads and 10-12 age group. My Iq is 128 and I’m 11 but when i took an advanced and quick Iq test it put me below 90. I would rate this a five if they could fix these things, but overall its a fair thingGames lose their interest when you get to a relatively low bar for a max score.

Certain games scoring is way off from others…

Premium is nowhere near worth it as there just isn’t enough content.  I’ve finished almost everything and maxed scores out within a few days….",0,"Info is good, games just okBuyer bewareNeed more games for the day training.$$$ IS REQUIRED don’t waste your timeFine but annoying ads and Already found bugsGood but glitchyWas good until it wasn’tYou should cut off most addToo easy",Get it together BOSE!!!Sutten MShanaDFThe.rapist.ShaneDono G.LimbonextMacra440greywolf53000sleezy operators,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,1,0,9,0,0,0,978,has_tracking,82

Most apps do not! The lifetime membership makes it worth it because hopefully they will improve it overtime.  Right now the games are pretty boring and even doing your absolute best you get a very low score. I can’t beat more than 4% of the population on most games, and they don’t actually give you any tips or suggestions on what you are doing wrong or how to improve. So, not sure how this app is going to improve your brain. Instead it just shows you your limitations.  Yet, something still draws me to the app.  The graphics are fantastic.Update:  appreciate the update.   Seems the math section was fixed with key boards/choices of numbers.    Unfortunately it seems Tasty fractions was overlooked.    Still enjoy the app but not being able to do tasty fractions is causing me not to have a steady streak.

This app was recommended to me and I truly enjoy until I get to fractions. I can not input my information. No drawing with pencil, finger , or even tapping on screen for keyboard. So, I never get to earn daily tasks. I am hoping there’s a glitch somewhere and the team is working on this so the app can be updated. I really do not want to delete this app.As with most brain training apps that charge for a subscription, this one is ad-filled without payment. I will say though...that the app's ""guide"" WILL let you know how to fast forward thru the ad to make it as time efficient as possible. Personally, still running app for free, I appreciate the stats offered after each game- telling you how well you do in comparison to peers. Other tests/quizzes are also offered; however, you don't get an official report or analysis of your scores unless you opt in for paymentSo the title there’s so many options with premium too many. If I don’t wanna pay then I waste and hour of my day to see my iq score just have to pay but I don’t want to if you could see the scores for free the it would a 5 starts but until then if 4 because I’m NOT paying to see it and i don’t care if theirs a 5.00 option I could use 5 dollars for something elseHave not explored everything. Some times my phone didn’t register click so I ended up performing not well on some tasks/questions. The ones that worked seamlessly are great. Still a little curious on how some scores are low though it was done at pretty quick speed with 100% accuracy.I love the app so far, but have some slight issues.
1. Can’t easily find the personality test results for the tests I have already done.
Haven’t found them at all actually, maybe not used the interface… 
2. Sometimes I swear I hit the right tiles and it says I’m wrong but I swear I give the same answer again and it’s right. I think it’s probably me and also the app but definitely feels off sometimes.
3. Sometimes it’s very easy to hit wrong button if you tap slightly off. If your finger is slightly slipped. That changes the score. Maybe larger buttons?
Overall I like the app so far!!!",1,Lifetime membershipFractionGood but not great.This needs to be addressedGoodFinger slips and such,DishattoLady “T”andooleyavame grilHenneballNep Deep,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,563,has_tracking,82

I love the app, I love the stats, the tests. So awesome. That being said…

Why is family sharing not supported? I paid for a lifetime membership because I played a quick trial on my sister’s phone. Now I would love to share it with my significant other, who really enjoys it and plays it from my phone.

I would love to share the app without sharing stats and scores. Paying for a lifetime membership should support family sharing. Thank you for the amazing app. But c’mon. You got my money, now let me share it, puh-puh-please. 🙏Like I said in the title, it's fun and you want to keep playing. The stats are cool as well, they are encouraging, at least to me, to keep attempting to get a better score. 
I notice that it really helps me bolster certain cognitive abilities, like memory, pattern recognition, problem-solving, etc. 
Way back in 2015, I was in an auto accident, and had a traumatic brain injury. These are the types of games that were recommended by doctors and specialists to strengthen my cognitive development.
This one happens to be fun too.this app is cool because they give certain tests that i would like to know about myself in quick format. How accurate they are is another thing, but it does use user-base data against your scores so it measures your intellect against other users personal percentile, and thats something. Havent gone through personality tests and stuff, but i dont see any self help lessons or games that help anxiety/stress related things just more of memory, math and reactions. Still fun!This is my second day on the app, the games are fun, but I feel as if the tests and scores are just saying the nice things about me. I’d like to think I am smart, but it feels at little patronizing. I did get a really good deal for a year subscription, and there is a lot to do on the app. Look forward to seeing more!I don’t go for app games usually- but the aesthetic they used looked nice in the ad I got and the puzzles are really fun! It’s also on the “short and sweet” end of app games. And they’re all different puzzles so it isn’t boring to play, ya know?? Plus- it gives a score based on people in your ranges results and I always think that’s fun. ^^”Overall enjoying this app and I only have the free version. Wish this app tracked across devices. Not sure if i have an account in which i could log into on a new device.

And I’m so happy I saw that add!! The app is amazing, user experience is so neat and the color scheme is perfect. What i like the most is that I only need  5 min per day to stretch my brain muscle. So I complete daily brain sessions and feel really better (on a 17th training day now). Pricing is a bit tough in case of taking a monthly subscription, but I successfully utilized the Christmas offer the app proposed. Just for the price of 4 cups of coffee I now can have lifelong brain training!! I would advise the developer to add some brain music and sounds, say for focus, productivity, concentration (I personally consider this to be crucial for effective working or studying). Apart from that, are you planning to add some training streaks? I noticed in other apps that this feature motivates me the most. But anyway the app is great and i recommended it to my friends and family (and i’m not the type of a person to recommend every stuff i see)This app is AWESOME I’m talking AWESOME. so first off, the app has ads only every once and a while, not every second and they are pretty chill because you only have to wait five to ten seconds to skip. They also have sales that one times gave 92% off of a premium package just because I picked the right box. You can also just remove ads for 5$ without ur having to buy the whole premium package. The app is also so fun for an adulation and mind game. The mini games that they do are so fun!!!! And yet it also tell you what it will improve on. For example one game might say at the bottom, “improves creative thinking” You can also start a streak and play little work out games every day. I honestly love this game so far after I got it YESTERDAY. I play it every day before bed or in the day when I’m bored because it’s usually hard to find fun games without getting bored of them. So I think this is the perfect game for all ages and all genders. DOWNLOAD IT IT’s WORTH ITI have noticed my mental decline over the years and felt unsatisfied, so one day I realized I wanted to take action on it and do things to help me keep my mind sharp. That’s when I found Impulse and decided to give it a shot. 

Ultimately, the results speak for themselves. I’ve been slowly making progress and I’m able to play certain games at a speed and precision I didn’t even realize I was capable. I cannot speak as to how well using Impulse has actually benefited me, but my mind feels sharp and I continue to get better by the day. 

In terms of features I’d like to see in the future, I think there’s potential to include more gamification concepts such as streak freezes, leadership boards, and learning material to learn what could I do outside the app to keep working on keeping my brain sharp.I’ve been using the app for a couple weeks and really enjoy it. The games are pretty unique and helped me understand what skills I’m good at and which ones I need to train more. I like that the “Progress” section shows you the average score for each category and specific game. I think it would definitely be nice to see the average score based on training skill too. For example, I noticed that my “Selective Attention” was high based on the high scores I got in a few games. I also noticed my “Working Memory” wasn’t as high based on some lower scoring games. I think it would definitely help seeing that in the “Progress” section so we can keep in mind what we need to work on. Maybe even some links to research articles or something for each training skill would be useful tooI’ve been living with anxiety and depression since I was 18 (mid 50’s now), and recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I’ve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.  

The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.

The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I’m fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.  

Highly recommend the app, and I’m looking forward to seeing increased results as I progress.At first I was skeptical when I saw this Ad on Instagram but I told myself “what do I got to lose? Just a little bit of space.” And ever since that moment I’ve been having a blast and keeping up with my streaks. 

The games aren’t that difficult when you first start and very easy to pick up, there’s also creative games you can play aside from the 3 brain training games a day.

There is a subscription you can acquire to unlock more features for the app but I can’t lie, the free version is just as good as the paid! I do see myself acquiring a subscription in the future! Looking for something to keep that brain active in a world of mush definitely give impulse a go!When getting an app that you hope will improve your quality of life and help you spend better time on your phone you want it to last without having to pay several dollars a month. This lifetime subscription is affordable and comes with everything I wanted and more. I wanted challenging and fun games. This app has that. I wanted daily notifications and a streak counter to hold me accountable. This app has that. The added bonus of self-improvement resources, IQ tests, and personality tests was something I didn’t know I wanted but you guessed it… this app has it. Love the app, keep improving it and adding more challenge, you’ve got a happy customer here. 🤙🏽The reason I like impulse training is because it makes you think quick on your feet, makes your heart beat faster because it makes you get excited because your racing against the clock and trying to beat it without missing any. It’s also exciting because you want to be quick and get it right and as quick as you can but you don’t know if you can. So it’s like your trying to prove to yourself you can do it and at the same time not let yourself down. Then when you do beat the clock and you score good on each game; at the end your happy and it was satisfying!! Like a pat on your back to yourself, good job so to speak!I have an attention deficit disorder so I generally get bored of apps very quickly. This is by far the best app I have purchased for the purpose of entertainment/ education/ mental training. Their are tons of different games which helps keep my attention and if I get bored of one type of game their is another I want to play. Also all the rewards and scores  that they keep track of for you really helps you enjoy the games! Getting a better score then you did last time is very satisfying, as well as seeing how well you compare to your peers. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!I have been using this brain training app for a few days now and I have to say, I am impressed with the results. The app offers a variety of games that are designed to improve different cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.

I particularly enjoy the variety of games offered - from matching cards to solving puzzles, there is something for everyone. The app also has a progress tracking feature which is helpful for monitoring my progress over time.

I appreciate that the app encourages daily use, as it has become a habit for me to play the games every day. It's an enjoyable way to challenge my brain and I have noticed an improvement in my focus and concentration since I started using it.

The user interface is clean and easy to navigate, and the app runs smoothly on my device. The daily reminders are also helpful for keeping me on track.

Overall, I highly recommend this brain training app to anyone.I love the test it’s encouraging to see and test your speed and ability to find out your score in each category. I strive to improve on my own time and that’s wonderful to feel not pressured to hurry up and get done with the one your doing to straight away do the next … you can finish the one your own leave the app and come back to see if it’s helping AND IT DOES!… although you do get gentle nudges every now n then to remind you to come play !! Thanks MaryThe challenges are a bit easy but that’s only cause I started yesterday. The app said they would get more challenging as I go on so that’s cool. The challenges are enjoyable and seeing how I stack up against everyone either makes me feel proud or makes me want to try the challenge again for a better score. I wish there were a bit more challenges in the daily ones. Great app to incorporate into your daily routine.I meant what I said in the title it gives the most accurate is tests and it’s mind games and mind workouts are of a high level. The training that it gives definitely shows improvements of all sorts to every aspect of your intelligence. I saw many improvements to my iq including my score going from 114 to 122 in just 1 month. I continue to use this app to strengthen my brain and I would suggest it to any ages from 7-127. Thank you impulse.The little games are fun and even if the brain work and improvement is minor it is still satisfying to feel like I am doing brain workouts. 

The general IQ test is really fascinating and I am so curious about the science behind it. I have no doubts abstract / complex pattern recognition does indeed point to general brain efficiency, but what about the questions are suited to measure functionality and if the results line up pretty evenly to scores on other IQ tests. 

Definitely try it outI’m lowkey addicted to this app. It’s so interesting and it rlly helps you learn more about yourself and how your brain works. It backs everything up with statistics and others scores. I definitely would recommend the yearly plan. Only 30 bucks if you get the discount and it’s 100 percent worth it. They have so many activities to do and it really trains your brain to keep u sharp and active. Definitely would recommend this. 10/10I was hesitant to pay the monthly fee because I didn’t want another unnecessary subscription Im probably not going to use BUT I have ADHD and struggle a lot in areas of focus, memory and impulsivity. I just started it and it’s already entertaining my brain. I like how they increase difficulty and compare your score to other people so you can see your growth within time. You pick if you want 5 / 10 or 20 minutes per day. I picked 10.(real review- not sponsored!!) i just starting adding this to my daily routine because i want to keep my brain healthy. i’m a world where most of us are sitting in front of tv or social media most of the day, it’s so healthy to remember your brain and keep it sharp!! i love that they keep track of your daily streak and gives you a variety of different games each day. 10/10 for sureThis is a quality group of intelligent games that are good for your mind to test your skills, sharpen your thinking, and just have fun. 

I love seeing how I do compared to others and compared to my previous scores. This does a great job at both. 

I am sick of all the fake, click bait apps out there. The ads are rarely as they advertise. Nice to find one that does what it says and does it well.I love the fact that it’s a challenge me mentally !and they make it fun n competitive with a timer . They inform you of your score by correct n incorrect answers plus give you a percentage of your score out of a 100. The game also tutoring one time with every level so u don’t have a incomplete test score …like they say if you if you don’t use it you lose it !So I was hesitant as usual to try any kind of cognitive brain app but let me tell you that Impulse is absolutely enjoyable and it helps sharpen your mind just enough every day. And best of all this all sharpens your mind with fun interactive games and gives you your statistical scores at the end to help you understand where you stand in comparison to your peers. I absolutely love this app.I really enjoy all of the brain games on Impulse. None of them make me feel anxious or over stimulated and I love how it tracks progress and shows how your score compares to your peers! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a game app that isn’t just full of ads and time killers, and actually wants to keep their brain young and healthy!I really like brain puzzle games. This app has all the games I have played over the years and more, and I love that instead of just a score against yourself you can also see what parts of your brain you are working with each game type. I wasn’t going to pay for the subscription but now I think I need to!I think it is a five star because it reminds you of when you should start playing that day so you can keep a streak. I love how it has different games you can play and different tests you can do. There are some challenging ones, some easy ones, and most are very fun! I recommend this app because of how fun and how good it exercises your brain!Not to overbearing with what you can and can’t buy right now I wish I could have 5 training games a day free but in the future when I’m just trying to complete my streak and not anything else the three games is very manageable also like how the achievements only correlate to what activities I can play for free, I love how I don’t feel like I’m missing outI’m so happy for it’s scoring so much I just can’t believe it’s happening! My birthday is December 10th 1984 and my first name starts with the 12th letter in the alphabet and my second name starts with the tenth! As for 1984… 1+9=10 & 8+4=12…. And then they have the same number as my very first score which was the first perfect score of the first game and I swear to you that my score was 1210Aside from being asked to pay(like all apps these days) the FREE games are dope. I did the IQ test and yes I did pay for it. I’m vain and wanted to see how smart I am. I got 132. According to the app that’s gifted. My girl got 129 lol. She got the “superior” title though. So though my score was higher now she can lord over me that she’s “superior.” Haha I love it. Real great app. Lowkey I may pay for the subThe activities are fun and engaging. They keep your brain active and make you think. However, unlike some other brain stimulating apps, there was no frustration here. I welcome the areas where I need improvement and look forward to a higher score the next go round.Very convenient app to use when on the go. I use it on the commute to/from work or when I’m standing in line for something, and I must say I feel much more motivated when I see that my score has improved in a specific cognitive area. Looking forward to future updates of the app!Whether it’s short, moderate, or long form brain exercises, this game has it all. Plus, it explains what each game is meant to help you with, and analyzes the data from your previous scores in order to further tailor future games. I’m only a couple days in but I like it a lot so far.I actually love training my brain I have many games so far and this one actually motivates me to keep going because I don’t want to lose my streak. It’s really simple and very fun to do! It shows how to do the games first and then let’s you improve. I realllyyy like to keep my brain going, so if you’re like me this is the game for you!!I am a 66 year old female and I have some memory issues at times.  My family is concerned so I have been enjoying the impulse games that are letting me use my brain and helps me prove I am doing fine and it is not as serious as some people think.  I have scored well and will continue to use daily!I just started with this app and so far I really like the variety of brain games available. I really like the descriptions of what the different skills are and trying to beat previous scores. I want to work on focus and visual memory skills and I think this app works for those areas well!The games are clever and easy to learn. I def feel more alert and focused after playing a couple of games. I also like that it gives you a comparison score at the end just to act as a benchmark for improvements over time (e.g., performed better than X% of people your age).The games are simple and fun, but also harder than expected.  It’s nice to see the score improvements from session to session.  I have a decline in my score when I don’t use the app for a while (months); that is a good reminder for me to do it daily.Impulse has helped me too relax and unwind while still keeping me on my toes, the only thing I don’t appreciate is how much you have to pay if you want to get the full experience. I really wish you could just see your test scores. Other than that Impulse is AMAZING.I like the games-there are many to choose from and they’re challenging. I like that the score tally will tell me where my skills fit in with my peers-when that number is lower than I’d like, it make me want to do it again to score higher.The games are really great! Fun! Entertaining! You think….how easy is this going to be…..guess what….?? Lol it’s not so easy but not impossible and I cannot wait to replay against my last score! I cannot say enough good about this app….Try it out and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!I’m having a great time with this app. I’m naturally competing and I love to improve my scores. Some of the games and tests can get pretty tricky but you walk away feeling accomplished. Even if you’re spending 5 - 10 minutes a day on it. Happy with the purchase.I like that it exercises the brain, something you might not think about doing too often. My favorite and the most satisfying part to me is how it compares your scores to others in your age group. It’s cool to see the results especially if you’re above average.I consider myself a person of pretty high intelligence. Boy, was I wrong when I started playing the games. But - I got better and better. And now I enjoy beating my old scores on some games and tests. The games are explained well, and are really fun to play!!This app is great for me to engage with each day. The app provides simple and short instructions and the games get more challenging as I continue to play. I also like how the game gives me a score which encourages me to do better next time!! 
SusanIf you want to push your mental training to the next level, look no further. The daily challenges will get the ball rolling and pushes you to achieve higher scores with each task. Absolutely love this appt and I highly recommend you download it.I love how challenging this game is and the fact that it’s something different everyday. It also tells you how well you scored va others that have played. I feel great about scoring better than 90% of my peers that played the same game!The ability to focus your thoughts or keep them at bay to achieve each mini goal becomes a true test of your mental agility!
Great tracking tool for your thinking improvements!
A purposeful use of time in stark contrast to the mindless social media apps!These games are perfect for enhancing my focus which is why I chose it. I can tell depending on the time of day, my mood, and even whether on an empty stomach or not how well I score or how bad I score. I will definitely continue to play with focus! Love the games…Very exciting, challenging but still possible to accomplish. Helping me as I find myself out of reach of my studies with applying myself to achieve an eligible score to be accepted into the AirForce. Thank you! to the creators and investors who made this App possible for everyday Humans such as myself :)

Mahalo Nui from Maui!This app has all the “brain-games” in one!  Keeps it fun and engaging while tracking your progress and increasing difficulty. Absolutely a joy to use. Much better use of downtime than mindlessly scrolling social platformsA fun game that replaced half the games on my phone all while providing a unique way of tracking progress and improvement in skills. A good challenge that can feel like a brain massage.

   Just be careful about the free trial.  The phrasing is a bit confusing.  I deleted the game because of it.Impulse is a great brain game! It is much better than many other games because it has a daily workout/goals set for you when you arrive. The games are fun, new,amd different!

I’m 38 and I love the idea of technology helping us a few mins a day to stay more productive in the ol’ noggin.

I had another brain game app that I did for 103 days straight! But eventually I got bored with is. This is similar but also a whole new set of games. And what I also love is it tells you what you need to accomplish to level up! *

* the other game I used would almost randomly level me up, it didn’t make any sense at times how it would be achieved. I like accomplishing goals but that’s just meI just started using this app a couple days ago and has been great so far!   Trying to work in a simple and attainable way to work my brain out a bit more.    The games are fun and I love the way you can customize your goals.   I have been doing 10 minutes a day which I find to be achieve able but there are others options with 20 minutes a day or even 5.   I like the additional puzzles, tests and games also.   Super cool and I’m trying to convince my husband to get it.I use this app for focus, memory, and for fun!
I like setting my daily goals and I like being surprised that I’m better than I thought I was at any given game at times. This encourages me to keep playing, which in the end, is helping you achieve your goals for using the app. Have fun playing!So much more than just a game. Helps you exercise your brain and understand how your brain works. Specifically programs to you and your type of learning, setting up specific goals for yourself.I’ve tried a lot of brain game apps in the past and this is by far the best one I have ever seen. It is all encompassing for every type of training you could think of and helps you set goals to boot. I love it.",0,From an RN: So far so fun!Fun AppGreat all around app!Awesome AppTerrific!,Burke RaleighChiefKatyKatVinCenT0605Tiffles0807bearbqd,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,348,has_goals,7

The company makes it all too easy to sign up and intentionally difficult to cancel your subscription. In the meantime, you’re paying 28 bucks a month— which if you keep it, ends up being almost 340 dollars per year! I’ve used many brain trainings apps and none were even close to being this outrageously expensive! Even intensely involved video games (with very advanced graphics and complicated storylines) don’t cost even a tenth of this to own for life! I’m truly appalled at how much they’re charging and disgusted by their use of “free trial” to lure people into paying an exorbitant amount for something that isn’t even worth a fraction of what they charge. 

Would NOT recommend, unless you have disposable income.I’ve been communicating with Impulse support for over a month with no tangible results. I have to follow up with them once a week. No one will respond. I’ve asked for my money back because the app has removed my entire history and will not redeem a purchase. 

While their product is great, I will no longer use this app. There are plenty of over apps out there that do the same thing. Buy them instead.",0,Outrageously overpricedWorst Support,AngelaAretzkeldel22,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,242,has_narrative,11

That is all “ it is called a tooth” when first started legal tests. I was told I would have a different reflection other than what I am ,  I am here taking this review lightly! And I want to learn self inspiration out of the many things I had to learn and do. Thank you for the app! I will use it to the best of my conscious betterment to evolve a better connection through a history  that was commuted by war. And I value my life with most of all and a higher being does not bother me of just a shoulder shrug. HBO brain games since I was a kid. Was not a topic but today’s question. The brain doctors were part of my sympathetic life in hope of my pathetic being. I may feel a bit strange, but walking out from the light felt like a dead nail. Thanks for the app and please review my review with thumbs out!I genuinely do not enjoy phone games. Too much story, too many things to collect…Blah blah blah. I like that this is simple and actually makes me feel like I am practicing skills.

I was also in a coma for an amount of time and have a brain injury as well.  In addition, I have a history of dementia and Alzheimer’s on both sides of my family. I can already see the improvement in my thinking, and the ability to remember things accurately or at all. I shared what I have been doing on this impulse app just this morning in my substance use disorder class. I recommend to anyone of all ages and health conditions.Impulse has countless number of different games that challenge your eyesight, mental acuity, innovation thinking, and it challenges the brain which I believe will help with mental disease prevention. One of the best features is that you don’t need to be connected to the internet. You can play a quick game literally anywhere you are. I highly recommend Impulse if you don’t have patience to sit for long games or that drag you into some deep story.Having the strongest brain on earth, after I suffering the worst injury in the history of humanity, 11 brain blood clots, when no one has ever surved more then 7 brain blood clots and they ended up blind, paralyzed, and unable to talk. This app significanly helps keeps my brain sharp and healthy  After suffering such an injury, this app is helping bring back nearly all the memory ive forgotten!I know I don’t remember enjoying school but this is fun. Feel like I could just do this all day. Being that my family has a history of mental illness I think I just might thanks for making it fun!!!
Personally I think everyone should use this app big and small…I like being able to strengthen my brain even when I’m busy working and doing school work. It’s fast and not very time consuming. My family has a history of dementia so I’m hoping this will help prevent me from developing it.I have a history of Alzheimer’s in my family, so I was looking for a simple way to integrate brain training into my daily tasks. Impulse is by far the simplest way to smoothly keep up the routine without being overwhelmed.Ok in my opinion Impulse is the greatest brain game in history because you learn interesting thing and also you can see what your own iq is and your personality mine was iq 123 and influencer was my personality I’m pulse is amazing 5 stars out of 5",0,*********THE most entertaining mental game for non-game people!App is perfect for the strongest brain on earth!Am I in school???GreatPrevent mush brainBest brain game ever,Mentally EELDMW9283Jacob AlimoretaffaxxkebexxLight_codexMr Gamer3275,Impulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain TrainingImpulse - Brain Training,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,434,has_narrative,11

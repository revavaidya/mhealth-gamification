4,pos,2017-10-26 22:57:492020-01-03 13:11:38,0,"In my own, personal opinion, the features that would earn fifth star would be to expand compatibility toward Polar brand products and applications, and to allow users to enter in specific ingredient, calorie, macro/micronutrient restrictions to be alerted to in meals & recipes.  It would be great to know if something I ate (or am logging because I'm about to eat) will conflict with a low FODMAP diet, or has more of a specific nutrient than I want at the time.  I recall a previous version that would offer food tips (""this food is high in sodium"", ""this food is a great source of vitamin c"", etc.)

I haven't yet tried the paid version, and these could be included there, but I felt it worth mentioning.  Overall, the app comes packed with so many intuitive, convenient features, I have succeeded in making journaling with it part of my daily dietary considerations.  The terms and conditions of the challenges offered are abjectly terrifying, though, and ought to be more prominently featured before agreeing to them.  Currently, the language you provide allows sponsoring companies the freedom to scour my phone for any notes I've taken to work on business projects of my own during my participation, and hamstrings me to do anything to defend my own privacy and trade secrets afterward if they take any action on them.  Not cool.I have been using the app for over a year using the premium version. I really enjoy using this app to track my food intake.  Great articles & videos to help you with learning more about food, exercise & more.  App works great on the iPhone & iPad. Also like how it sync with Apple Health app & Activity app. I have had some challenges with the recipes downloading but eventually get them to work. For the app, under the food diary, I wish the column that are titled Calories, Carbs, Fat, etc were static so as you scroll down.  I always have scroll back up to remember which column is which.

Thanks to MyFitnessPro, I’ve been able to gain weight better, healthier and keep myself honest with how much I’m eating. It’s even become fun. I’ve been underweight most of my life because of health reasons that run in my family. Half the time food tastes like ash. With how much I can do with this app, I can set goals, find new meals as well as note which meals I like best, and have the ability to work on myself more effectively and healthily. I’ve hit the weight I need twice since starting use of this app, and once I even exceeded by 7lbs (which is so hard to do! If you’ve been underweight your whole life, gaining weight is just as difficult as losing weight!!!) Every goal has it’s challenges, but using this to help push you and make the best decisions for your health will certainly help. A dash of self motivation is all you need. Best of luck!!I love using this app.  It took some time to set things up, but once you do, it really helps me thinks about the choices I’m making when I eat, and therefor to stay on a healthier track. Like being able to connect with other friends that use it which further increases my ability to stay focused on eating right and exercises. The challenges add to that to. Able to put in own recipient is awesome (hoping at some point can easily share such with others, friends, also on the app). Like the recipes and articles they have. Never had my app crash; always functions well. Love being able to scan certain foods straight into the diary function. Maybe someday I’ll look into the premium app...",0,Underweight uses - it’s goal setting for all body typesIt really helps me stay on track,MaraKay1jejurah,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,295,has_challenges,4

But that was not enough for you, so you added more and more intrusive ads to your already clunky app UI, causing more instability to it. And that was also not enough for you, so now you are removing an essential tool that was free from the beginning of times to be behind the premium subscription.

I’m a loyal customer and I’ve been using and recommending your app for several years now. Your clunky updates destroyed my food database several times, but every time I go back and rebuild it from scratch because I like your app and the functionalities it brings. However, putting free features behind paid subscriptions instead of enhacing your app and adding more features and value to it is unacceptable. You are going to lose more customers if your company’s goal is to get their money rather than to help them improve their health.I have been using this app off and on for a few years depending on my routine and it’s always been a good, basic tool to see where you are at with calories and macros, without being tied to a specific program and their tracking method (like WW for example, which tracks points).  Even my dietician recommended it as I was trying to navigate switching off WW and getting back to actual tracking of food and activity and not points conversion. Now that the barcode scanner has moved to a premium only feature; I’m out. As others have said, tracking can be hit or miss, I’ve found several to be incorrect, even with multiple entries, and my activity has never synced correctly to my Apple Watch. This app has never been seamless and accurate enough that I would pay for it - there are plenty of others out there who can offer mediocre tracking for free, that you don’t need to pay for this one that is also inconsistent and full of ads.",0,Your Greed is a Bottomless PitI’m out,RayPianokmd0170,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,365,has_points,13

Some things are just clumsy and/or glitchy which makes using it throughout the day kind of a pain. I’ll continue to use it, but as other similar apps arise I’ll definitely keep checking them out as there’s nothing really tying me to this one. 

Some examples: it repeatedly asks me to allow Apple Heath access even though it’s already got it (and is already using the data it gets from there). It reads my weight and then writes it back to Apple Health resulting in duplicate data points. I couldn’t get it to integrate reliably with UnderArmor’s (pretty terrible) other apps. It doesn’t make use of 3D Touch, which could make moving/peeking/editing items in my diary much faster. It’s got visual glitches along the top and bottom of the iPhone X screen. I turned on the negative calorie adjustment, but that was REALLY glitchy, sporadically giving me a negative calorie adjustment > 1000 before updating to < 100 a couple minutes later. Googling this shows the issue has been around for a very long time, but they haven’t addressed it. 

I’m paying for pro because they cripple the basic set of features so much, but at this point I definitely feel no loyalty to the app, and I wonder what they are doing with all that subscription money.I don’t mind the ads, I enjoyed the articles, but this new roll out has been horrible. Finding historical weight beyond 1yr is not available unless you’re willing to pay (I assume, because that’s the only way you can export your data that I can see from your computer) and trying to find where to log/view weights on the phone app is absolutely nothing like what is shown in the tutorial. It is nowhere to be found. I can only find it on my laptop version (and only for 1yrs worth, never mind I’ve been using my fitness pal for a number of years). Next, foods log extremely slow (using Apple 13 pro max). I find this app to not be very engaging at this point. I enjoyed the historical data, I enjoyed seeing data points on the good days of what I did right, and I enjoyed the quick add of foods/meals before this roll out. I guess I can still read articles, but I’m still not purchasing a subscription for a slow and clunky app where historical data is not going to be available any longer.Copying meals from the previous day NEVER works on the first try. The highly-intuitive plus button at the bottom center of the screen for quickly adding foods, logging workouts or entering weights has been removed. And now, the barcode scanning feature has been removed for free users. Not to mention the cost of a premium membership has increased since I first became a user of this app. 

Such a shame to see a great app with a solid UI fall victim to greedy owners that load it up with annoying ads that slow it down tremendously and require paid subscriptions to use the main selling points of the app.",0,"Lots of functionality, but not a very good appHorrible New VersionEverything that made this app great has been removed or is no longer free",jonnydesignermlistJoshm0809,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,540,has_points,13

It has always been superior in performance, ease of use, and sheer volume of foods in the database.  However, they have been steadily taking features from the free account to the paid premium account subscription over the last couple years.  The ‘final straw’ I suppose was taking away the free barcode scanner.  That was truly one of my larges marketing points for this app, and repeatedly told friends and family “it’s free and you can even just scan the barcode on labels when you’re making dinner.”  Now that is no longer the case, which has made me turn to other apps who do have barcode scanners thrown in for free.  I understand that businesses exist to make money, however, I believe the diet journaling feature with the scanner should probably have been left alone.  Just my opinion.Pros: Still likely the largest crowdsourced database of nutritional info out there, which IMO is the most important feature for tracking consistently as the more friction points (like having to manually enter calorie or macro info) you have the less likely you are to do it.

Cons: The latest UI changes are a disaster. It used to be extremely intuitive and easy to enter in your diary, it automatically prompted you with foods you’d typically pair with whatever your first entry was and it used to be easy to see what had been entered. The changes made in the most recent version add significant friction points for the most regular actions.

Every time we stopped because it’s hard to devote energy to eating properly we would gain back the weight. So this past June 2021 we decided to go at this again. This time we didn’t want to give up. The simple concept that this app provides isn’t about points or restrictions it’s about eating proper portions and eating within what your daily calorie intake should be for a person of your desired weight loss. Since then I have lost over 20 pounds and he has lost 30 pounds. It isn’t easy but this app holds us accountable for our behaviors with food. We both want to be healthier for each other so we are around for not only our kids but for each other. I would recommend for people to try it. Plus it’s free. The paid for portion isn’t necessary to be successful unless you want to.I admit I am not a hardcore training kind of guy.  But, even at my level of mild (really mild) training, and paying mediocre attention to what I eat, the FitnessPal app is very useful. I do try to pay attention to making my entries, and because of that, I do watch my calories more so that I would do otherwise.  When I run out of my allotted calories, I pretty much stop eating for the day.  Beneficial from two standpoints:  1) I know what my calorie intake should be, and 2) I actually pay attention to it, from a consumption standpoint.  So, even though I am not enthusiastically training, I am also not just eating everything thinking it is okay.  Just the awareness and self-imposed accountability of tracking is far better than a lackluster approach of paying no attention at all.  I also count my steps, which is personally satisfying, and have my FitnessPal cross-linked to Map My Ride, which my wife and I enjoy using, also.  Thanks for both!!I love this app! I have tried all kinds of different diets and it has always been to keep track of certain things (ie. “Points”) in order to be successful. This app makes it painless and I absolutely love the idea of scanning barcodes… this app actually puts in all the nutrition information for just one serving automatically! It is so easy to bump it up to two servings, if that’s the case. I eventually decided to try the premium addition as it breaks down the nutrients even further to show you exactly what you are consuming and how much - spectacular! Finally, it synchronizes with my Fitbit app which saves even more time as it automatically puts in the correlating information.Really really well thought out. Ideal for calorie counting and exercisers. The database is incredibly complete. Many small points were beautifully thought through such as the ability to change potion size and quantities (fractions or decimals). Have tried many diets. They all work to some degree for short term loss but then one returns to previous habits and all is lost. If one continues to track eating then one can maintain the loss. This really helps. The monthly cost is worth it. Kudos to you!

Still love the app a year later. New suggestion. Love the ability to swipe to add yesterday’s breakfast or yesterday’s dinner. You don’t have that for lunch. Could you add it?I swore i would never give up again. My indomitable human spirit was almost crushed under sheer numbers - calories, upon calories upon calories. Well thanks to this app I am taking control over everything that goes in my body. Knowledge is power and having a numerical representation of nutritional info is a life saver. With this new obsession i will be unlocking premium very soon. Thanks for giving a quality product with minimal ads in the mean time. No judgment, just data points; log everything (calories in, calories out, weight, water)  but, do it everyday.I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for years. I have used other fitness apps that have free and also paid memberships and that use points systems and was unsuccessful. I started with the free membership for my fitness pal and progressed to the paid membership. I love the paid membership because I can track macros and fine tune my weight loss.

But I took away 2 stars for 2 other reasons.  You may not care about these issues.  If you just want to journal, this is the best app.

The app does great with tracking food and finding foods and their nutrients  The best feature is the barcode scanner. If there is a barcode on food you can usually get the nutrients from the barcode. Makes it really easy to log all the specifics.

On the negative side.  How food organized, and how your most recent grades come up, isn’t totally intuitive. additionally, the green badges that indicate trust in food is sometimes not accurate. I’ve looked up nutrients for specific foods and found they don’t match some of the green badged items.   It’s a great idea, but I need a little more QA. That is why I took away one star.

I took away another star, because of the fit bit syncing problem. The worst feature is that the app often won’t sync with a Fitbit. It says it will.  But it won’t.  It’s a glitch in the system.   This has been driving me nuts for the past three days. It is apparently driving many other people nuts as well. Better not to say you have the functionality, then to say you have it and have people spend literally hours disconnecting and reconnecting devices without success.

- The UI was already not amazing, there were already a lot of ads. That wasn’t enough? You had to be more greedy and take away literally the only redeeming feature of the app and put it behind an unjustifiable paywall? Under Armor sold MFP to a private equity firm called Francisco Partners in 2022. Are we surprised that a private equity firm, that really doesn’t know anything about fitness and only cares about money is ruining the app? Their generic, corporate replies to the reviews show that they really don’t care about the feedback they’re receiving from the users. Francisco Partners is most definitely not struggling financially, their revenue is over $100 million and they have over $30 billion in assets. MFP is just a number to them. They probably decided that putting the barcode feature behind an unreasonable paywall was more valuable than brand image and customer satisfaction. They have formulas to figure that out. 
- What is the incentive to pay for the premium version when the free version hardly functions? I would not pay for an app that I don’t trust to work. 
- overall, I’ve been tracking my calories by hand in a notebook because I would literally do that then use this app anymore because of what you have done to it. Under Armor selling this app was the worst thing to happen to itReviewing after I've deleted the app that I've used for about 3+ years. After finding out that they will be removing the barcode scanner from the free version, I'm done. 
The existing library of foods is so unreliable. Half the time the calories or other data for foods are incorrect, there's multiple selections for the exact same things, and then even still the best part of the food tracking is mediocre. I get a lot of ""cannot be found"" errors from some of the most well known brands and foods trying to use the scanner. Your other option is to ""create"" a new food and input all of the data yourself. 
I've already received some replacement suggestions so will be trying them out. Between this and the huge full page ads now, it's like they want to drive away their free traffic. Also continuous issues with the syncing. Having to remove and re-pair my iOS health app ALL THE TIME because it doesn't automatically port my exercises frequently. Never used to have these issues until the last few months. I wish the app was physical so I had the satisfaction of throwing it in the bin. Edit for developer response- your link is broken. Like your app....App now demands expensive monthly recurring payment for basic functions like barcode scanner. Other better apps do this for free. I’ve deleted the app and so have several of my friends. Twenty bucks a year would be a bit much but twenty USD per month is just greed. I’d give zero stars if I could. Just say no. 

[Previous Review Prior To MFP Selling Out]

I recommend trying out this app. One concern though: for someone trying to gain or maintain weight the feedback system is wrong (it is not a good thing when weight goes down). The feedback in the app should be appropriate for the goal. Wish list: many people who use this would really benefit from another screen tracking medications. I would even be willing to pay for that as an additional feature. Another feature I'd pay for is tracking of vital stats like blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, temperature, and so on. Of course add encryption. Putting this all together with this excellent UI would be a wonderful thing for health and fitness.I’ve been a religious MFP user over the years, singing it’s praises to many of my friends and family as it’s helped me track my calories and lose weight successfully. 

The last few updates, however, have reorganized the app in nonsensical ways and added full-screen ads which are not only entirely obnoxious but also frequently break the functionality of the app or interrupt data entry. 

The upcoming update to move barcode scanner to premium will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, though. They’ve effectively crowd-sourced a huge database of nutritional information from all free users for over a decade and will now require those same users to pay for access to that database we helped them build. 

This is a one-two punch that has a good chance of knocking this app out of existence. I certainly hope the developers and whoever else is involved with these bad decisions sees the feedback this is generating. 

To the person who is posting developer responses - no need to post the canned response with the link to why you made the decision to move the scanner to premium. It was obviously for money and that blog post doesn’t give any information of substance anyway…instead perhaps provide some of this feedback to your team.It seems like the company must be struggling.   They are slowly but continuously making their app useless unless you are willing to pay.  They forget that tons of people just want the basic calorie tracking capabilities and could care less about all of the other bells and whistles.   The issue is that it’s a nightmare to use if you are one of the “free” users.   Ads everywhere, manual entry of all foods, no barcode scanning.   The other issue is the cost.  Their app is like 10x more expensive than some of the other great apps.  Do they forget they are not the only app out there?   There are other apps that are much better and still free.  Don’t waste you’re time with this one.  I predict they will lose their “top spot” in the tracking industry.   And it won’t take long either…. Sad.Some things you can avoid with inflation. This is definitely one of them.  It's one thing when you add features for people to pay for, but another thing when you now charge for what used to be free.  And the fee is a lot for what little value you get. If you made it to where you pay one lifetime fee, then I'm sure the feedback wouldn't be so harsh, but $20/mo or $100/year is overkill.  along with trying to make the app more like Facebook, which is also backwards because those kind of apps are exactly why a lot of people are too distracted to reach their health goals.  Your goal may be more money, but I refuse to take part in it.  There are other great apps out there that I would gladly give money too just because they don't operate how you all decided to.I only gave it one star because there’s no option for zero stars. Over the past three months of use, this app continually doubles up my macros and calories in Apple health which affects other apps I’m using to track my health. This seems to happen on a completely random basis. After submitting multiple reports to tech support I only get a generic reply back thanking me for my feedback and someone will be in touch. Apparently MFP developers have known about this since October 2017 and still haven’t fixed it. Requires the user to continually double check Apple health data against what is reported in MFP. This app is garbage at the moment and not worth the 9.99 Per month. If you are going to charge me for it, at least make the thing work.

Best parts are the app speed and responsiveness and the huge foods database. As a diabetic, I would like to see glucose and insulin tracking, as well as connection to continuous glucose monitors such as Dexcom. Would be nice to have all in one place as some other apps now do. I have considered going with premium on several occasions, however MFP is now the most expensive tracker available now, with less features! You have also moved features that had been free for years, and are common with every other app, such as the scan function, to premium only. Quite frankly, that move by itself made me want to find another app and stop using MFP at all. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. Most likely, I will not be using MFP any longer. Hate to leave, but no longer works for me.It seems that there were recent updates to the iphone app that make it harder to find foods you recently ate and add them fast. I'm sure it was supposed to be an improvement some how, but I actually have found in the last week or two that I cannot find my history as easily. It also seems as if the app has not changed my caloric allowance in a long time, and so I have started to lose momentum in weight loss. I can subtract my own number of calories to get momentum going again, but it seems like that is something the app was supposed to help us with. 
Steps also seem to be gaining 1/2 of what other research suggests for calories.  Not sure why. 

I have loved the app up until this point. I hope it will go back to it's strengths. I could be me doing something wrong, but I wanted to give honest feedback.In the past decade I’ve personally used MFP to drop over 30 pounds and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 5 years ago, I told everyone I knew about it and couldn’t have said enough good things. 

In the past 2 years since the UnderArmor sale this app has deteriorated so much that I am actively considering other options despite having 10 years of data in the app. I could write a laundry list of feedback, but most importantly: bugs are now the norm, especially in the recipe storage/creation, exercise calorie logging and progress tracking. And the ads are too many in number, disruptive to efficient usage of the app and genuinely disturbing sometimes in terms of content. 

I’m so sad to say this but if I was a new calorie counter looking for an app, I’d probably shop around before settling for this.Wow, what happened to this app? The UI used to be more intuitive and easier to use. Now it’s a clunky mess. I wonder if this is because of a constant internal feedback loop where testing doesn’t even reach the end user anymore. There were also ton of features that would make usability even more of a breeze to use and yet with each update, things keep getting stripped. One of the best ways of logging food was scanning a barcode and now it’s stuck behind a pay wall. I get the pay wall pop up more than I can actually use the app itself. I understand the developers need to find a way to monetize, but taking away features that were once free is not the way to go.",0,Going downhill fast.Recent changes unhelpfulLoyal user considering other optionsWhat happened…,justusemynameffs2021T.

The creators built up a phenomenal database of foods by barcode using user data and once it was fully fleshed out, they moved that functionality behind the paywall. Time to find a competitor.

Yeah. I know. Your “literally just scan the thing” option used to be totally free, but it isn’t anymore. That’s my complaint here.Useful app for macro tracking but the UX could use some work so as to not be so confusing. When I first updated my macro goals, I went back to the Home Screen and it showed the default ones. I tried again several times but it kept showing the default macro goals on my dashboard. I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to figure it out. There is no confirm button or any feedback to indicate that you’ve updated your goals successfully, so I thought there was just some confirm button that I couldn’t find. There wasn’t, it just takes half an hour to update on the dashboard for some reason. 

This and other similar issues of not enough signifiers or proper feedback make the app confusing to use until you get the hang of it. Now that I know a bit better how it works, it’s nice to have, but I almost gave up before figuring it out due to how painful of a process it was.I wish there was an option for building muscle. I don’t weigh a lot but I definitely have fat I’d like replaced with muscle. My point is while setting up the app I noticed it’s main concern is weight; although, if I lost fat and gained muscle I would gain weight, but I’m not underweight by any means, nor do I care if my weight is maintained. So for goal oriented people (like me) this may be a set up for failure. That being said, asking for weight is definitely something that helps & I understand why it’s needed, but I think broadening the goals would help cater to people, and reinforce the fact that weight loss doesn’t always mean healthy, just as weight gain doesn’t mean unhealthy.

I have to use the app for an exercise course I’m taking at school so just thought I’d give some constructive feedback. 

[hmm I think I’ll choose “gain weight” as my goal??]I really feel like a bad decision was made, and it has made logging MUCH more difficult. I’ve had MyFitnessPal for years. I’ve tried other fitness apps, but have always come back to MFP because of the ease in using the app, EVEN in the free access portion!

Just launched today after updating, and now find that scanning barcodes is part of the PREMIUM NOW?!  Seriously?  I understand the more in-depth information being part of the premium service (macro breakdown, advice, etc), but the scanner…?  

PLEASE reconsider because I’ve always bragged about how EASY it was to log foods, ESP with the scanner and have actually provided that as feedback to other fitness apps because they didn’t have that feature EVEN for PAID customers.This is the second review of any app I’ve ever used, and it’s mainly for feedback purposes. The apps core functionality of tracking your diet, your macros, your exercise, and even the integration with FitBit is really innovative but so poorly executed. 70% of the time it won’t execute searches properly. Most of the time it’s not connected to my Fitbit unless I disconnect and reconnect it. Currently I’m at work trying to access the desktop version of the app, and it’s not loading. I can only assume this is because the mobile and desktop apps share the same server. 

Without the application connecting to the internet to fulfill its searches, and connecting to my fitness devices, this app isn’t useful at all. I’d get better results from writing down what I’ve eaten.Let me say, I love how easy it is to use this app. Premium features I would even say are worth the yearly cost. But if you use this MFP for nutrition coaching like Eat To Perform (ETP) it will not align properly. What you log in MFP app reflects differently in MFP online. Like foods reflect data in the app are different online. They are the same company. There is no reason this should be a thing. Customer service was contacted and they were no help. Please send the feedback to you me product development team to fix this issue. It’s a major issue. Multiple third party apps pull the online MFP data. It is too cumbersome to log data directly online when the point of the app is convenience.",1,Entering food using barcode scan is now paid subscription onlyHelpful but a bit confusing at firstTarget weight shouldn’t be the only goalWhat Happened?

1. When looking at your progress there should be a “highest weight” option because I’m sure there’s a lot of people who’s “starting weight” and “highest weight” are different.

2. I would love more motivational milestones. Or if there was something like rewards for losing weight. For example, if I’ve lost a certain amount of weight, it would be nice to have feedback from the app. Maybe a pop up with stats and facts about how long its taken me, or how that weight affects the body. One time I logged for 100 days straight, and on the 100th day I was expecting something to happen...a congratulations or something but it was anticlimactic and nothing happened lolIt took them a long time to initiate net carbs, but once they did it has been very helpful to me. As a diabetic, the individual and total net carbs are the best predictor of my next morning’s fasting blood sugar. About maybe a month ago, the net carbs on the Diary were totaling properly, but on the dashboard they showed a total number which is way out of whack. It has even shown NEGATIVE numbers for the daily total. And, of course, once the day is over the numbers on the dashboard and diary reset to zero. I have logged a problem with customer service and sent them screen shots of the two screens. I have had no feedback on resolving the problem or any contact requesting any further info. Fortunately, they are now totaling all columns on the Diary (for a while they weren’t) so I can get the correct daily total numbers.

First of all, I want to say I've been using this app on and off for about 7 years now. When I first started using it, the app projected weight loss no matter the calories. At the time I liked this, but looking back I realize how bad that can be and how it could cultivate eating disorders. It makes me unbelievably happy that they have changed it to not publishing food diaries, not posting it on feeds, and giving you a warning that you're not eating enough calories to sustain your body, and that it won't project weight loss for under the necessary calories needed for functioning. The first time I got that message I was discouraged, not because I wanted to see what I'd lose, but because I realized I needed to eat a lot more in any given day. Nowadays I get that message and I'm encouraged to use the app more to make sure I'm actually eating enough to live healthy. So, huge props to the developers and team for making sure people are staying healthy, and cultivating good eating habits.This program (paid version) is fantastic, and it is deep in connectivity to data bases and other apps offering real help in maintaining a healthy diet. There are many creative ways it is designed to give positive feedback when good choices are made, and gentle reminders are given of ways you may be sabotaging your own best plans for weight management and health. 

The free program offers a lot, but the ads pop up so often it makes it essentially unusable for any length of time. The paid (premium) version would be fantastic if— they get around to making it shareable inside the family. Most apps today are designed that way, this one should be took The cost is fine for a single person, but if a household wants to manage their heath together, the cost is prohibitive to pay for a single user license for each person. I hope they fix this.For the past few weeks now the app has been requiring me to log in constantly. Even if I have already used the app that day. It is becoming frustrating because I don’t want to have to continuously log in. I want it open and available to enter food in my diary as well as check my daily progress. With so many apps to choose from I really liked this one the most and don’t want to switch but I have to do what’s easiest for me, trying to lose weight is a big enough complication",0,Great app geared towards healthy dietingCould be greatWhy the change,Victoria_RenrollarenomikeafroKISHiac,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,443,has_feedback,23

A friend mentioned this app to me, and told me to try the free version 1st.  I was so impressed with the ease to use it and the reminders to log in I went ahead and paid for a subscription.  Because of the easy to use tools and awesome feedback, I’m on track to hit my 1st goal and haven’t been this excited about logging my food daily!  Usually I give up on that part and never get any weight off.

During this time, my Dr. Office called to tell  me I was too high on cholesterol on my bloodwork.  I then started paying even more attention to the nutrition tracking part of the app which has really helped to learn about the foods I’m eating and how many mg per day I’m eating.

Additionally, I had purchased a Garmin Venu SQ2 to help track my steps and golf game.  I was so excited to finally get it to sync to MFP so now my steps automatically update in the MFP app!  I can have an extra “Treat” once in a while knowing how many calories I burned during the day!

I hate it. I won’t go to the details, but I just don’t find it as functional as it used to be. My old review is below; however, I will be using the Apple app from now on for what I need to track.

Over the years they have made steady improvements to this app. It is a great way of tracking those calories and other nutrients as well as exercise. There are still several things which need some improvement, however. Here are my suggestions: 1. Reduce the number of ads. They have become quite obtrusive over the years. 2. Give users control over what opening screen they view. I only ever use the diary, and that's where I would like to start. 3. Give the option of using swipe to add yesterday's lunch and yesterday's supper to the diary. Very often my meals are quite similar, so this will speed up entry. 4. Fix the FAQ/help section. As it is, after reviewing an answer to one question, going back does not take you to the other questions, but rather to the top level menu where you have to start all over again. It's quite tedious. 5. Improve the connection between exercise and step tracking on the iPhone. This seems to work for a while and then it stops working until I reset it.App Is pretty awesome. Downside..zero apple Integration for exercise or app Connection. For $20 a month/80 a year.. I expect more. Especially with so many other choices out there. No need to buy the full version unless you need to pinpoint your exact macros..most do not. Using a scale at home and logging it is MUCH cheaper. Apple Health does NOT integrate well at all. STILL have to manually input steps/cals,etc .so therefore it does not integrate correctly. Zero need to link a how to—just fix it..correctly. The massive amount of complaints since this company got bought out in 2020 is ridiculous. I mean just read the amount of upset people, better yet go look up the decline in numbers 👀. Fransico Partners are too greedy and it really hurt this app. Update: app is still charging for scanning and still many issues persist. Save your money and use much better apps out there. Or a scale and a notebook. Sad to see such a great(former) app go down the greedy way. Looking at their numbers over the past couple of quarters.. it’s obvious many feel the same. Will not be back and deleting all data.

Thank you for responding. However, like I stated the app does not integrate correctly.  Steps, workouts.. Consistently incorrect. As a trainer, save your money.The database of foods and nutrition is great and makes logging super easy, however the recent interface update made the entire process overly complicated.  Huge step backwards in the user experience of this app. The social media part is kindof weird, but I suppose some people would enjoy the community aspect. Where I’m frustrated is that for weeks and weeks now my workouts from the Health app have stopped syncing altogether. They just don’t show up. That causes the calorie goal not to adjust, and stays exactly the same as if you were sedentary, making my fitness tracker hardware obsolete. There is an option to log exercises within the app but they’re extremely limited and have zero accuracy as far as calories burned. This issue has been listed as a “known issue” for months, and I have reached out about it directly, and update after update, nothing changes.  I’m not sure what’s happening to this app after being great for so many years, but I’m beginning to research alternatives.I have been using this app for almost 2 years. The new update horrible! It is so focused on getting you to pay for the premium version. It is not user friendly and is not easier to use as they advertised it would be!  You used to be able to click a plus sign and choose from entering food, water, workout, or your weight. That is now all gone! You have to now take 5 steps just to get to the progress section to enter your weight.  In order to enter your meals you have to go to the diary and enter it from there, yes there’s the search bar on the main screen but not nearly as easy as it used to be. The app has also stopped pulling in data from my workouts from my Apple Watch, and yes all connections for sharing are still on and have been reset to try and fix this issue.  Just all around a horrible update! Wish I would not have done it!MFP use to be great. It was helpful in losing weight and tracking calories but over time they never updated the UI, they kept bringing in more and more ads that caused glitches in the software and most recently they introduced a paywall to scan barcodes, an integral part I used for almost a decade.  In addition, the algorithm to help reduce calories did not hold up well with the connection of other apps causing to many additional calories to be added.

I switched to Lose It and found it much more user friendly with a better algorithm to calculate the calories that is showing very good results. I did end up purchasing the subscription with Lose It to to gain additional functionality but was much cheaper overall than MFP.

Really disappointed with how MFP turned out.I’ve been using my fitness pal for what feels like forever - whenever I want to check in with what I’m eating or start a new exercise program.

I feel like the ad creep has been slow but gradual. I understand the platform needs to make money - I do. I was ok with locking macros behind a paywall, I was weirded out but ok with the platform becoming semi-social media, I was even alright with the banner ads that popped up everywhere. 

But then the full page scam ads started and I could do it no more. 

I like being discrete when logging food. I don’t really want other people to know and sometimes do it at work. So full page ads with sound sometimes is mortifying when I just want to log something quickly. And really - some of the ads are downright scammy. Not even recommended foods but “your device has been infected” es que nonsense that usually comes from being on sketchy websites. 

I wouldn’t mind a basic service with the occasional ad for free, but right now the platform doesn’t have any options that fit me. I don’t need any of the premium features I just don’t want the ads. That’s all. 

So goodbye MyFitnessPal and hello something new!This app is fine, I would give it four stars except for one extremely annoying aspect: In an effort to engage users more “socially” (read: for longer periods of time), the app forces you to view the “Home” screen (read: blog + social feed) EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU GO TO THE APP. Since I use the app 10+ times every day (to log every single meal and snack, as well as to plan meals), I’m forced to view this feed, which is of no interest to me whatsoever, 10+ times per day, every single day of the year. This means unwanted distraction and an extra tap (to the “Diary” screen — the only one I use with any frequency) every single time I go to the app. As a paying user, can we please compromise and force me to view the “Home” screen no more than once per day?New update is terrible!  Tapping on anything causes it to freeze up. The weight tracker is at the bottom and must be scrolled down to which causes app to freeze. Put daily weight in and it freezes, then closes on its own. If you want to compare to year ago, it will only show you the graph. You have to open and close weight section multiple times before it will show number values when comparing timelines. This update is an utter failure. The tool bar at the bottom is in the way. All the social media parts seem to be the focus now. We have too many social media apps!  We need a good weight and food tracking app. Appreciate if anyone has a recommendation. After 11 years here I’m ready to goSyncing between the Gear Tracker, US Record app,MyFitnessPal, MapMyRun, and MapMyRide IS A COMPLICATED MESS.  especially if you are trying to log on with the computer (desktop mode) vs mobile mode / my phone (where I can't ""add workouts"" or ""add miles"" to my Gear Tracker if I use my running shoes for a jog without using the app at the same time.)

This is disappointing because I’ve been using it for over a year and like the added ability to scan the upc to track my calories. I am going to have to look for a different app. This is what the security pop-up warning says is the problem with this app:
Malicious Sources/Malnets
Sites that host or distribute malware or whose purpose for existence is as part of a malicious network (malnet) or the malware ecosystem. Malware is defined as software that takes control of a computer, modifies computer settings, or collects or reports personal information without the permission of the end user. It also includes software that misrepresents itself by tricking users to download or install it or to enter personal information. This includes sites or software that perform drive-by downloads; browser hijackers; dialers; any program that modifies your browser homepage, bookmarks, or security settings; and keyloggers. It also includes any software that bundles malware (as defined above) as part of its offering. Information collected or reported is ""personal"" if it contains uniquely identifying data, such as email addresses, name, social security number, IP address, etc. A site is not classified as malware if the user is reasonably notified that the software will perform these actions (e.g., it alerts that it will send personal information, be installed, or that it will log keystrokes).I started disliking this app a while back when they added this social media feed or changed in someway (after reading some other reviews, this may have been when the app was bought out.) Because I've used this app for years I try to ignore it I just continued on. But now, after about a eight month absence, I find that scanning your food barcodes is behind a paywall. What was once free you now have to pay a ridiculous price for. While I'm used to this app and have had it for years, I will be looking for another option. --As for the recent developer response: I'm aware I can add that way, but I'm sure you can see the amount of people annoyed that you took away this feature from the free version that made things so much faster to use. Money grabbing at its finest. I'll still be looking for another option. Even if I have to pay, as long as it is cheaper than your premium. ~on top of my current concerns, the sync feature for the data from my iphone/iwatch doesn't work the way it should on a regular basis. I've checked all of my settings, it is all correct. Just another reason to look for a new app to use.I had MyFitnessPal a long time ago on my phone and used it frequently until I lost interest in keeping track of my weight. I decided to download it again recently because I’ve been wanting to keep track of my calories/macros but it is just not the same as it used to be.

I used to be able to keep track of my macros on this app but now they want us to buy a “premium subscription” in order to do that even though there are tons of ad pop-ups already. So now the only thing the app tracks is steps, calories, and reported weight loss/gain. I mean I might as well just track that stuff on my own and not use an app at all. And every time I open the app they ask me to buy their premium subscription which I clearly don’t want nor can afford, and it’s so annoying.

This app has also turned into more of a social media site since the last time I used it. There are blog posts and profiles, and other stuff that just doesn’t make sense for a diet/fitness tracking app. I am honestly quite disappointed by how much the app has changed and I’m thinking I might just delete it soon.I have been using MyFitness Pal for about seven years now and have always been happy with it. Best parts are the app speed and responsiveness and the huge foods database. As a diabetic, I would like to see glucose and insulin tracking, as well as connection to continuous glucose monitors such as Dexcom. Would be nice to have all in one place as some other apps now do. I have considered going with premium on several occasions, however MFP is now the most expensive tracker available now, with less features! You have also moved features that had been free for years, and are common with every other app, such as the scan function, to premium only. Quite frankly, that move by itself made me want to find another app and stop using MFP at all. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. Most likely, I will not be using MFP any longer. Hate to leave, but no longer works for me.This app may be very popular but there are 2 things that make it unusable for me. 

The serving size options are very random and many items don’t have gram options. Even when there is the gram option, it can be a very random number, like 85..and then I have to figure out what fraction of 85 is the amount that I need to input. I always use a kitchen scale, and use different amounts so this ends up taking too much time. Luckily I found a similar app called CalorieKing...you can just input the grams and it calculates it for you, so inputting serving size is super easy.

The other deal-breaker is that there are so many items that have incorrect nutritional info, and multiple entries for the same exact item..each with different nutritional info. It’s easy to just scan a barcode and not double check, but when I did, I realised many items were incorrect. CalorieKing has a very minimal item list, but I end up having to create items in mfp anyway since they’re wrong so often, so it doesn’t make much of a difference. 
Also, CalorieKing has a much nicer layout and doesn’t have all the social stuff which I really don’t care for on mfp. 

Oh yeah, and when you open up mfp, it doesn’t take you directly to your diary, it opens up a news feed, which on most days doesn’t change at all. Annoying.There are some great features to this app, like its extensive database, ability to save meals, and import recipes. Unfortunately it’s also glitchy and quits communicating with its own server, as well as apps connected to it. The result is a lot of wasted time and data trying to reload the app, log back in, wait for the database to connect again, etc. 

The UI needs to be simplified and dummy proofed. It’s easy to get all the way through inputting an entire recipe and accidentally back out of it causing you lose your work. It’s not easy to find certain functionalities, like syncing and device connection. 

All in all, I think it’s a useful app with potential. With a little more investment in quality control, it could be great.",1,Security RiskScan feature now locked under paywall & sync is spottyNot the same as it used to beGoing downhill fast.Serving sizesGlitchy,SparksFly007Erianne NSam24011justusemynameffs2021763872NoFitz97,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,1,6,2,0,0,0,1195,has_social,31

Well, I’m overall not too unhappy with the app, but it has room for improvement!  For example, in the app if I click on a video, it makes me go to the website to watch the video, then when I’m watching the video, it tells me to install the app,  I already have the app installed. Why are you telling me to install the app again? 
Why can’t I view the videos through the app? Why do I have to go to the website?

A lot of the functionality in the app takes you to the website, which makes it extremely difficult especially when you have a bad Internet connection. That’s another problem with the app. I recently was camping trying to use the app, it’s basically unusable unless you have an Internet connection. So, if you’re traveling with this, let’s say in Europe, and you don’t have cellular service?  Basically, this app is rendered unusable . There needs to be some way that you can track with Notes or something so that when you get an Internet connection it’ll update,  it needs a better way to use it when you don’t have an Internet connection, it’s pretty unusable without the Internet that’s not good!So as a nutrition tracker MyFitnessPal is the best. Premium offers a lot of decent features that I recommend. You can customize any macronutrient or vitamin you want. Syncs without error to my Apple Watch and scale. 

I rate it so low because the app is full of bloat and misleading information. The app opens to the homepage, which is full of “trending”fitness articles and recommendations. You can’t even customize the type of articles they show you. So the articles and videos are often off topic or non-relevant to your lifestyle. In this section there is also product recommendations (even though premium is suppose to remove ads). I would prefer the option to open to the diary screen because this is the reason I use the app. 

It’s a solid tracker if you can get past the  annoying newsfeed and lazy attempt to be a social media. I understand they have to make money, but if your paying for premium allow more options to change the newsfeed.I really like this app, except that it does not consistently pick up & show my steps and exercise data from my Fitbit. My Fitbit always picks up all the info from My Fitness Pal and consistently updates & shows new entries immediately from my food diary that was entered on My Fitness Pal, so I know the issue is with the My Fitness Pal app. It’s very frustrating, have tried manually synching, logging in and out, but the only thing that sometimes works is to disconnect the connection between both apps and then reconnect, but after doing all that it usually just updates that one time and then doesn’t pick up any further updates from Fitbit. I would give the app 5 stars if it wasn’t for this. I don’t think I’d ever sign up for the premium service either and pay with that annoying issue going on.Constantly logs you out; I get there was a breach once but constantly kicking me out of the app all the time is a great way to annoy me, have reuse of the same password, or create really simple passwords since I’ll be asked every two weeks. If anything will get me to uninstall and delete my membership it’s this constant inconvenience. 

Not really a social site even though there are forums. Difficult to find the forums in the app. Porting things from other apps can be difficult. Adding exercise is broken into strength and cardio but not for any clear reason - not many are going to track an individual weightlift exercise and to lump “lifting” under cardio instead of strength doesn’t make sense.I’ve been using the “Premium” version of MyFitnessPal for a year. I log in every day to log my food and weight. I use it to keep track of common meals and recipes. Ultimately I have found the service incredibly helpful with my training, but I regularly run into bugs and other quality issues that seem to go unaddressed:

- The application regularly goes into “offline” mode while using the app and searching the food database. Checking other applications I can confirm that my cell and/or WiFi connection is ok.

- When adding or copying foods to a certain day/time that is not “Today” the item will sometimes disappear and be added to the current day instead of the one you are editing.

- When creating and editing a recipe spaces and other special characters will be removed from the title. 

- Etc. etc...

I’d love to give this app a five star review. It truly has transformed my life! But after a year of putting up with these quality issues I am starting to seriously explore alternatives.",0,Needs improvementGreat nutrition trackerDoesn’t consistently pick up & show info from Fitbit.Constantly logs you out.A Wonderful (But Buggy) App,kc-sunshineTheKlep*Michelle16Karkennaandrewsliwinski,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,836,has_social,31
3,pos,2019-01-07 18:16:19,0,"Pros:
Easy to use logging. Love to mess with recipes to see how I can make what I want work with my calorie goals. Barcode scan is dead on balls accurate. Great accountability with notifications and information when you track food. Like, it highlights things I wasn’t even thinking about (eg, this food is high in sodium, etc). Connection with other apps and devices is solid. 

Cons:
When the app is working well, it really works well. I have had it crash twice now and lost all (the first crash, which included losing my premium information and several back and forth emails to get that reinstated without having to put again) or most (the second crash) of my data. Today there are network issues so I can’t track anything or log food.

There are so many ads now which I understand. But some of them pop up on your feed right when you open the app and there are some really gross images. A lot of times I am eating when I enter my calories and the images for the weird ads are so gross it makes me stop eating and lose my appetite. There was one that came up for weeks that showed someone getting ear wax removed. Now I logged in and it shows a close up of someone removing some type of gross substance from the back of their throat. Why would you have these kinds of ads show up on the home page of a food log app? 

Also, if you sync with Fitbit it enters your workouts automatically but it also tracks your steps and gives you a calorie adjustment for that as well, which Is like double tracking. If you go for a run for example, it will sync the workout from fitbit and give you the calories for that, and then also add in your steps from the run and give you more calories which I don’t think is accurate. 

Other than that, no other food app compares as far as the extensive food database and the ease of being able to enter recipes, meals, etc. I also love the social functionality where friends can comment on your status. Of course they have to scroll through all the ads in the feed to find your updates, and overlook the gross images of earwax and other things.I've come back to MFP after a few years and am very pleased at the many improvements in capabilities, user friendliness, standalone mobile usability, social features, and the UI in general. There are 2 glaringly obvious QoL things that are missing.
The first is Recipe Sharing. As it is now, the only way my Hubs and I have found to share entries between people is to copy an Entire meal from someone's diary. It would be much simpler to be able to share the recipe with him on the front end so he could use it as he chooses. It would be even More helpful if we were given a little space to jot down actual directions so these ""recipes"" weren't solely lists of ingredients and I could recreate things. That may be asking too much though.
The other, much more important issue is that there isn't a setting to switch from displaying Total Carbs to Net Carbs (total Carbs-Fiber). There isn't even a way to show macros and Fiber at the same time to do the math yourself. The custom settings only allow for 3 nutrient selections (you'd need 4 to show Carbs, Fiber, Fat, Protein). This is something that needs to be updated ASAP.
Oh, and fyi if you're using a macro based method know that you'll need premium to get access to those tracking features.I recently got this app because I see it recommended a lot on social media apps. I like that it’s easy to track food & gives you a lot of food options. But it doesn’t track the calories for weightlifting like if I do squats or hip thrust (it’s not even an option because they don’t have the exercise including others🙄 but anyways) and I did read what it said about how it’s hard to track weightlifting because it depends on the weight and how vigorously you work out but still you know I wish I could track it.I wish MFP would actually spend development resources on improving the core function of tracking calories and macros. Why is is still impossible to use a recipe within a recipe? Why is is so hard to correct/update product nutrition info while adding it to your diary at the same time?

They leave alone the aging user interface while adding mostly useless features like exercise (which you can’t remove from your diary view) and social networking features. 

There’s no way to set weight goals based on your body fat % either. If you, like many actual MFP users, you don’t want to be built like a stop sign and actually retain some muscle, you’ll have to do your own research and manually enter your macro allotment. Unfortunate that the app hasn’t come farther than this.

Of course, I’ll keep using it until a better, more intuitive solution comes along.",0,"Gross Pictures with Ads but extensive databaseRecipe Sharing & Net Carbs?More exercise optionsStill the best, but needs a change in direction",AliHart1983pennyb324Monicam.oStarting Solids,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,1,0,0,743,has_social,31

It worked so well & I loved it, personally I dint even mind all the different ad bombardments after logging food in. But sadly they decided to put a feature, the barcode scanner which I use regularly behind the premium pay wall. The barcode scanner made my food log ins easier & faster, it's literally a key reason as to why I became more consistent regarding tracking my food. I’m not even going to consider buying premium because it is extremely overpriced. Putting previously free features behind a paywall will not make me wanna buy into an overpriced premium. I guess onto another app that actually offers decent features for its free users. 
My problem with premium it’s overpriced. I realize premium offers a bunch of different features like a handy barcode scanner now & a lot of different tracking mechanics which is great if you want that. When my goal is literally track my calories & protein (that’s it, I’m not interested in anything else) why would I pay $80 a year or even $20 a month (that’s basically a gym membership by the way) 
Solution: Creat another cheaper more affordable tier to premium that allows you to do all the basic stuff free users do without ads & a barcode scanner. All the other fancy features could stay behind the more expensive premium tiers. Lets say $2 or $3 a month.I loved MyFitnessPal because it felt like a tool to improve myself, but with the latest update there are advertisements that pop up out of no where. This app now feels like a cheap App Store game bolstering the user with ads after logging food which is far from the type of feeling you want when trying to take your nutrition seriously. I see now this app is no longer for the user to improve and just another company doing everything they can to squeeze advertisement revenue out of willing businesses that only negatively affect the user experience. 

I wrote this review a while back and now starting October 1st, the barcode scanner will only be available to premium users. This may be a deal breaker for me, I shouldn’t have to pay money to scan my food and live heathy.  I think all free users can agree that removing a free feature and making it exclusive to premium subscribers is an awful decision and will likely lead many to leave myfitnesspal for other tracking services. 

Much of the recent changes made to the myfitnesspal app shows that there is no consumer voice in the room when making decisions. In a market where the competition and myfitnesspal have no discernible difference it is becoming more and more easy to leave this once great app for others offer better service and don’t require a premium subscription to do so.I know this review will go into the abyss and MFP really doesn’t care, but here it is:

- The UI was already not amazing, there were already a lot of ads. That wasn’t enough? You had to be more greedy and take away literally the only redeeming feature of the app and put it behind an unjustifiable paywall? Under Armor sold MFP to a private equity firm called Francisco Partners in 2022. Are we surprised that a private equity firm, that really doesn’t know anything about fitness and only cares about money is ruining the app? Their generic, corporate replies to the reviews show that they really don’t care about the feedback they’re receiving from the users. Francisco Partners is most definitely not struggling financially, their revenue is over $100 million and they have over $30 billion in assets. MFP is just a number to them. They probably decided that putting the barcode feature behind an unreasonable paywall was more valuable than brand image and customer satisfaction. They have formulas to figure that out. 
- What is the incentive to pay for the premium version when the free version hardly functions? I would not pay for an app that I don’t trust to work. 
- overall, I’ve been tracking my calories by hand in a notebook because I would literally do that then use this app anymore because of what you have done to it. Under Armor selling this app was the worst thing to happen to itI’m a long time loyal user of mfp, over 10 years. It was never fancy but it served my needs and had a huge database and was just the OG app every fitness person used. I never thought I would have to switch to another app until now.
Ever since it was sold by underarmour to a private company is has gone downhill. The app is now so inundated with ads you can barely log anything without annoying pop ups plastering your screen and slowing down your logging process. On top of this, I think the ads may be affecting the app’s performance because I have had far more crashes and freezes lately than in the past. There is nothing more aggravating than being halfway through creating a recipe for a meal you meal-prepped for the week to have the app crash and you lose all your measurements that you’d recorded up to that point. 
The final straw for me was when they put the barcode scanner behind a paywall. MFP is very expensive compared to other calorie tracking apps. I can’t imagine anyone would hand over the money for a feature that has historically been free and for an app that is increasingly buggy and annoying to use.
I can’t believe I will be leaving MFP but I just deleted the app today and transitioned to MyNetDiary which seems to have a decent database, a free barcode scanner, and an interface that doesn’t hurt my head to look at.I came back to this app after years away and deleted it after 5 minutes. I now have severe fibromyalgia and just wanted an easy way to monitor my calorie and nutrient intake to see where I could adjust to lose weight because the pain and fatigue interfere so much with my activity. But the free version now gets you almost nothing. You can’t track anything on a daily basis except calories. Unfortunately, pretty much every other app seems to be the same. Virtually all apps have become money hungry. Gone are the days where you could pay a small one time fee or choose a free version with ads that were only minimally invasive. And too many people pay, so a market backlash won’t correct it. I’m going back to using my Fitbit. It cost me $60 for the band, and the free version of the app tracks sleep, activity, and heart rate and includes a diet tracker that’s almost as good as the paid version here. I was switching because I stopped wearing it as the band has started irritating me, but I think I can still use the account and the diet tracker. I refuse to pay for apps that were free for years. The cost of digital tech is getting way out of hand, not to mention the money they make tracking us and selling our info. That alone should make everything free. This is not the way capitalism is supposed to work.Don’t bother downloading this app if you are looking for a useful free tracker app. If you’re fine with paying the monthly subscription, I suppose it does the job and is one of the oldest apps of its kind, but there are other free apps that do similar things. I have been using my fitness pal on and off since 2014, almost 10 years, and I am finally giving a review and deleting this desecrated app. Sure, they have been giving new features like tracking fasting and net carbs, but everything useful that used to be free is now behind a paywall. Ads on the “free” version have gotten so distracting and obnoxious that it is difficult to use the app. There are even pop-ups that block the entire screen for several moments until the “x” becomes available. But the last straw was that they removed the scan barcode ability from the free version and deposited it behind the paywall in their premium subscription service. Quite possibly the most convenient and useful thing they ever had, and the reason I’ve kept it around as long as I have with the steady rise in ads in recent years. As with everything, greed caught up to them and they ruined something good. Not that I like Fitbit either, but now I will have to use them for nutrient tracking. A pen and paper is about as useful as my fitness pal now.Previously, I had a four star review for this app, but the redesign is a fail. I hate it. I won’t go to the details, but I just don’t find it as functional as it used to be. My old review is below; however, I will be using the Apple app from now on for what I need to track.

Over the years they have made steady improvements to this app. It is a great way of tracking those calories and other nutrients as well as exercise. There are still several things which need some improvement, however. Here are my suggestions: 1. Reduce the number of ads. They have become quite obtrusive over the years. 2. Give users control over what opening screen they view. I only ever use the diary, and that's where I would like to start. 3. Give the option of using swipe to add yesterday's lunch and yesterday's supper to the diary. Very often my meals are quite similar, so this will speed up entry. 4. Fix the FAQ/help section. As it is, after reviewing an answer to one question, going back does not take you to the other questions, but rather to the top level menu where you have to start all over again. It's quite tedious. 5. Improve the connection between exercise and step tracking on the iPhone. This seems to work for a while and then it stops working until I reset it.After taking a few years off from tracking (pandemic laze) I started to focus more again on minding protein and all the other necessary macros. But in the meantime MyFitnessPal has fallen even deeper into the money-hungry pit of boundless advertising, thus rendering the app maddening and nearly useless. Barcode scanning is now behind the paywall (which is just mean) and their add network loads so much crap on the free plan that the app crashes numerous times upon use. We’re taking just about every time I (and my husband) opens it up it crashes. 2nd tune usually works but not necessarily for long. You kind of get used to it? But should not have to, cmon. 

The kicker for me? You go to allll the labor of painstakingly entering a recipe only to have it crash when you go to save it OR gives you a vague error message. 15 min of tedious recipe entry repeatedly repeatedly lost. (Again, same experience for hubs)

So screw it. We’ve both very contentedly switched to another app (Crono___) that’s way more pleasing to use - even their free version - and provides a lot more info on nutrition and what, say, B12 actually does in your body and what foods are rich in it. Overall super happy with the switch so I guess 1 star to MFP for sucking enough to force us to find a better solution?Reviewing after I've deleted the app that I've used for about 3+ years. After finding out that they will be removing the barcode scanner from the free version, I'm done. 
The existing library of foods is so unreliable. Half the time the calories or other data for foods are incorrect, there's multiple selections for the exact same things, and then even still the best part of the food tracking is mediocre. I get a lot of ""cannot be found"" errors from some of the most well known brands and foods trying to use the scanner. Your other option is to ""create"" a new food and input all of the data yourself. 
I've already received some replacement suggestions so will be trying them out. Between this and the huge full page ads now, it's like they want to drive away their free traffic. Also continuous issues with the syncing. Having to remove and re-pair my iOS health app ALL THE TIME because it doesn't automatically port my exercises frequently. Never used to have these issues until the last few months. I wish the app was physical so I had the satisfaction of throwing it in the bin. Edit for developer response- your link is broken. Like your app....*Response to Developer*
Yes, we know, but it still doesn’t change the fact that the barcode scanner was always included in the free version of the app. After deleting MFP I downloaded Cronometer which INCLUDES the barcode scanner in the free version, and less intrusive ads. After using their Free Version with barcode scanning I’m happy to support them with my purchase of the annual premium membership for a fraction of the MFP price. - Thanks

*Original Review*
Circled back to MFP after over a year of not using it to help with my 2023 fitness goals. I opened the app to immediately be bombarded with an ad to purchase premium. I have had Premium in the past and it was great for macro tracking, however I wanted to get back in the swing of things before committing again, especially with how expensive it is now. I bypassed the ad and tried to use the barcode scanner to log my first meal and found out it requires you to pay. A free feature that was long time included is now being used as leverage for you to purchase premium, and that’s incredibly disappointing. It really shows you what MFP thinks about the consumer. This turned me off entirely and I will not be purchasing the yearly subscription that I planned on. App deleted.I was going to come and give this app a negative review because of the removed barcode scanner, but after reading nearly every single recent review and seeing everyone complain about it, it’s clear the developers do not care. They respond to everyone claiming “well there’s plenty of other ways to record your food” even though there isn’t a single other tracking app I have used that charges for the barcode scanner. And not only do y’all charge for it, but it’s an unbelievable $20 a month. Absolutely ridiculous. This app isn’t even worth using when so many other apps provide the same services as this one for free. I get having paid for services, but removing a service that is an industry standard and charging for it is a good way to lose a lot of business. Note for the developers: please do not waste your time responding to me. I get you have your little “we’re sorry you’re disappointed but there’s other ways to use our app” reply that you send out to everyone complaining, but it doesn’t make a difference. I know you don’t care enough about your customers do improve your app, so don’t pretend like you care enough to respond to a negative reviewI really wish I could leave a good review I have used this app for years and seen great results from it. Recently I got my girlfriend in the app and they changed the barcode scan into a premium feature. I genuinely cannot believe you would remove this feature. People use your app because it is easy to track. Tracking is such a daunting task for so many beginners and I would watch my girlfriend get excited to scan the foods and it was kind of fun. Now you are making it harder and more expensive for people to do what was such a simple task. I truly have no respect for this descision. If you think I’m over exaggerating this change you clearly have not met someone really struggling to make dietary changes. It needs to be as simple as possible. So many companies are basically taxing people for being overweight by making it so expensive to get started. I will be searching for a different app now which really breaks my heart. I used to recommend this app to all my clients. I’m sure many people don’t think this is a big deal, but it starts here. Many other features will be premium blocked or worse, the entire app will be come pay to use.My history with this app goes back many years and I credit the (old) service with helping me lose nearly 70 pounds. However, the newest update has destroyed the app and I am going to start looking for alternatives. After years of positive word of mouth comments from me to others I am no longer recommending the app/service and I encourage anyone hunting for a calorie tracking service to look elsewhere. The update is terrible and makes using the app a chore. This isn’t what the app used to offer and it isn’t what is needed when you are trying to get your weight under control. Big thumbs down for the changes.

Update-I’ve now played around with the app more since I wrote my review and I’ve changed my opinion some. I think the app is worse than I originally thought it was. If you are just starting out I can find no reason to recommend this app to you. I was dismayed to find that they even hold the ability to export my nearly 9 years of weight data hostage behind the paywall. Seriously?!?!  I am done with this app. Don’t fall for it. Find a different service and good luck on your fitness journey!I’ve been using my fitness pal for the better part of five years. I love this app because it give me more control and monitoring my own diet and tracking my progress. However, they’ve become greedy and are making you pay for features that have been existing within the app since the beginning. You now have to pay a premium price monthly, or about $80 a year just to scan a barcode. Scanning barcodes was always a feature in the app until now, and was actually marketed as a main feature if I remember correctly. They were always premium options, but you had to pay for those, obviously. It’s infuriating to me because now I can’t use the app as smoothly as I once was just because they want to make money. If you’re gonna charge a premium price, add new things to the app, don’t charge people for things that have been a part of it for years. They are greedy, and I will never recommend this app to anybody even though I’ve been part of the customer base for years. Currently searching for a better app. Pretty sure they also deleted my original review so I’m posting againRead recent reviews. Lot last 2 days. Must scroll a while to even find a neutral one. All negative. 

The one thing about reviews is that it will not allow zero stars. even for an app I have recommended to others I now have to apologize. this app has turned into a money grabbing bait and switch piece of garbage. If I’m going to pay for something I’d rather pay for an app with a fraction of what this app claims to do just so I don’t have to have this on my phone any longer I have been using the app for about a year and a half to track my carbs for diabetes. it recorded my meals, shared the info with Apple health that shared the info with my insulin app. I used none of the other functions that were available in the free version of the app other than carb tracking. The latest update requires mind reading. App stopped opening. App Store said update - endless loop. I had to delete the app and reinstall it fresh for it to update. Once open, I don’t see anything NOT BLOCKED by bjg boxes to get premium. Even foods I entered before! One app I will replace. The new improved version also stopped sharing data with Apple healthAnd now the barcode scan is going to be gone!!!!

Nope. Permanently done. Just make it a completely paid app at this point JFC!

They started slowly integrating little blips of paying for this and paying for that. I used to track macros for free. Then it was paid. Ok no problem because I can still see my macros. Then it was a complete layout change. Ok no problem something fun. Then it was glitches galore to where you couldn’t add anything because it wouldn’t negate it from your daily caloric intake. Then with this recent update?!?!? Full on intrusive adds that stay on your screen for an ungodly amount of time. It used to be a great app where you could just QUICKLY throw your calories or macros or food in for the day and modify later. Now it’s taken on the big tech scheme that everything else has. UNLESS YOU PAY After ten years many of us have taken on the hunt for a new calorie tracking application which is very sad because this app used to be amazing. So be warned with all the positive reviews, they used to be for the old versions; not this tech driven new version.I used this app for years and loved it. I heard an update was coming that would not allow you to enter food via barcode unless upgrading to the premium membership. That was kinda lame, but as long as I could still search the database and enter foods manually, it wasn’t too big of a deal. 
 Well now, you can’t even search the food database unless you upgrade to premium. It will only let you search through your meal history for foods to add. So, unless you’re on the premium membership, you can’t even really add foods to your diary, which renders the app (for me) pretty useless. 
 My advice would be to offer membership tiers. All I want is to enter barcodes and search foods. I don’t need all the training stuff, weird nutrient tracking stuff, and all the other doodads. I can’t justify paying so much money per month just to use the database and scan barcodes. 
 I wish I could give it more stars, but sorry. You priced me out. Until you make an affordable option, you’re going to be stuck with my review 🤷🏼‍♂️Update specifically for the developer: Company responded to my review with a link that doesn’t work to “read about their decision.” I don’t want to read why you made the decision. I know why. It’s greed. Your new venture capital owner wants more money. Adding friction for users to track food while trying to lose weight (which is difficult enough already)is NOT good for your business model. AND your subscription fees are grossly overpriced? Get out of here. I guess I’ll let my years long login streak end here. Baaiiii!!! ✌🏼

Original app review for potential customers: The only reason I used this app was for the barcode scanning and extensive database. As of yesterday I can no longer scan barcodes without paying an ungodly fee of $20 per month. Definitely definitely not worth it. That’s not something I’m willing to do, so I won’t be viewing the ads, or clicking the links, or participating in communities or events, or reading the blog, or referring to my clients, or anything else on myfitnesspal anymore. Uninstalled from my phone. What a shame.The newest change has got me looking elsewhere. I have used MyFitnessPal for over 6 years (have a streak of logging for 2373 days) I have seen lots of changes to the app over the years, but most recent all the push to “premium” and all the ads. I don’t mind having to scroll through ads knowing its free but when you start eliminating things that were in the free version that bugs me. Starting November 1, they will only store information for 2 years unless you are a premium member. I really enjoyed being able to look back at my progress and see trends (good and bad) with my health/fitness goals. Now if I want to keep that I have to pay for it. This was a no-nonsense easy way to track food/exercise that I would rave about to others. Not anymore as they have jumped in on the “profit first” instead of working towards general well-being for others. So bummed to see such a simple to use app change so much and become so commercialized. Keep looking if you are looking for a basic food/activity tracker for free. This one will hook you then make you pay...not worth it anymore.This app used to be the best app in the App Store for calorie tracking and weight loss and unfortunately that is no longer the case. Simple features that used to be free of charge, they now charge a subscription fee for. I loved the scan feature because it made tracking calories so easy. The scan would find the exact product and all you had to do is select the size/weight etc. Now that feature costs is only available with an expressive monthly subscription of $20. You can still look up the item by typing it in the search box but it gives you a long list of the same item all with different macros. Let’s be honest, it’s already a hassle to track everything you are eating especially when making recipes with many ingredients and different weights, why make this more complicated than it already is? Unfortunately I am leaving after using this app for over a decade and looking for an alternative app that would make up for the short comings of this app.I’ve used MyFitnessPal for a long long long time. I’ve tried many other apps and I come back to MyFitnessPal because it has my history and my recipes I’ve entered as well as the community ones. I can even find Chinese dishes written both in English and Chinese to approximately calories and macros. It’s great for tracking and I also appreciate that I can join it up to Apple health to read and write health data. It’s a big reason I finally gave up on the Fitbit ecosystem after owning multiple devices. 

This redesign in June 2022 looks nice as long as you don’t use it. I couldn’t find the progress feature for weight progress. It’s moved below the fold with no clear indication you need to scroll down. When you do scroll down the app has a hard stop at the ad forcing you to look at it before a few seconds later it allows you to finally scroll past it. I’m on an iPhone 13 pro and the app is laggy and glitchy. Maybe the latest most powerful iPhone can’t handle an app scrolling static information? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I used the free version of this app many years.  I was always hesitant to suscribe to the paid version because of the number of scanned foods not recognized and incorrect/incomplete data for many of the foods that did scan. While it was annoying to have to make adjustments for these errors to keep my calories and macros on track every day, I tolerated the  adds to have an easy way to track food. (Three of the foods I tracked for breakfast and snack were off 5-10 calories based on the packaging). While the paid subscription touts additional tracking information you provide users, I don’t believe your underlying data is accurate enough to provide the services you claim to offer. I have subscribed to several apps, I have no problem paying subscription fees for apps that provide a valuable service. I will be looking at other calorie tracker apps to see if there is one that has more accurate data. Otherwise, I will easily return to paper/pencil tracker.This app has been gutted from all the free features it used to include. After changing owners over the last decade (the original, then Under Armour, then Private Equity) it has continually lost features. I’m glad to see the annoying UA advertising is gone. The app isn’t trying to sell you anything except a premium subscription. But all this features used to be free. But now even macros cost money. You also can’t set a goal below 1500 calories for men and 1200 for women. Despite the push for premium subs and all the money they are making, none of it goes to cleaning up the database. It is still an uncurated mess of redundant entries and a dice shoot of whether any entry for the same brand will be in grams, oz, cups, teaspoons, or packages or will offer multiple options. These could and should all be consolidated into single entries with drop-down menus. I'm surprised they haven't solved this yet with AI. This empty husk of an app is no longer useful for anything but the bare minimum of calorie tracking, barely better than pen and paper.It’s one thing to add features and put it behind a pay wall and call it premium, it’s another thing to remove features that customers have used for years and put it behind a pay wall and call it “premium”. That is simply outrageous behavior.

Another thing that has gone awry with UA owning my fitness pal is there exorbitant monthly fee to use the premium version of the app. $20 a month is a gym membership or groceries. And what you get in the premium selection isn’t worth $20 a month. $1.99 I might consider it, but not with the app in its current state. It is so full of bugs now, and difficult to access basic functions, like weight, tracking, which, incidentally is buried. That it makes even $1.99 untenable.

As soon as I am able to finish testing these other three or four apps I downloaded I am deleting MyFitnessPal.  I’ve been using this app since 2012, and I’ve only seen it get worse and worse. Apps and programs are supposed to get better overtime not worse.Unpopular opinion.. this subscription cult is literally what is wrong with world. Anything to make a buck, I suppose. If you had a one-time fee to buy the app, sure. I’d pay it. But instead you want $80 a year (most likely more in the future) to log the same thing I used to log with the free features. I’m okay with paying for an app. Just not for the rest of my life. At least with other services I get ‘new content’ to watch or listen to. This is just taking advantage of an already abused market. The features that were free, like scanning a product that might not be as popular, are now no longer free. And instead of charging a manageable amount, they charge more than a gym membership per month. Oh, unless you pay for the whole year. Then it’s a quick $80 m (at least at the time of this review) in the hole for something most people utilize for a couple months. It’s nonsense and I will be shopping for a different tracking app. Don’t be a zombie.I’ve been using this app since 2014 well before the app was sold out to under armor and it used to be perfect. Over the course of time ads have been littered all over in the app (which I didn’t mind at all since it was a free app) but then features that I used daily started being removed from the app and put behind a monthly paywall. I just received an email notice today that the feature I use the most (barcode scanning) is now being moved behind a paywall as well. I’m now done with this app. Hiding new features behind a paywall, pumping the app full of ads, these are all fine with me but removing core features out of the app such as nutrition tracking and barcode scanning and forcing me to pay for them, shame on you. Save yourself the time and hassle of downloading and setting up the app and find a better one, more than likely they’ll move creating an account behind a paywall at the rate they’re removing features and forcing you to pay for them.App now demands expensive monthly recurring payment for basic functions like barcode scanner. Other better apps do this for free. I’ve deleted the app and so have several of my friends. Twenty bucks a year would be a bit much but twenty USD per month is just greed. I’d give zero stars if I could. Just say no. 

[Previous Review Prior To MFP Selling Out]

I recommend trying out this app. One concern though: for someone trying to gain or maintain weight the feedback system is wrong (it is not a good thing when weight goes down). The feedback in the app should be appropriate for the goal. Wish list: many people who use this would really benefit from another screen tracking medications. I would even be willing to pay for that as an additional feature. Another feature I'd pay for is tracking of vital stats like blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, temperature, and so on. Of course add encryption. Putting this all together with this excellent UI would be a wonderful thing for health and fitness.I have been a very long-time MFP user. Always a free user, but I came very close to subscribing multiple times and ultimately the thing that stopped me every time was lack of family sharing for premium subscription. For the cost, my wife and I shouldn’t have to purchase two separate expensive subscriptions.

Recently there has been a significant decline in experience of the app, with massive increase in the intrusiveness of advertising. I tolerated it, because the product itself worked fine and I wasn’t particularly interested in searching for a new app.

That all changed when they made the change to remove a key feature that has always been included in the free version, barcode scanning. This is a feature that is available in the free component of virtually every other calorie tracking app. I find this particularly egregious in the setting of partnering with the White House, where they are acting as though they are actively working to improve the health of the US. Clearly this is a facade.

So, I have deleted MyFitnessPal and downloaded another calorie tracking which I love. It has all the features of MFP and some. I won’t mention which one, because this isn’t an advertisement for another app. But look around and you’ll easily find plenty of other excellent options.

It honestly wouldn’t matter if MFP added back barcode scanning to the free version, I wouldn’t come back. It’s a matter of principle.Just received the email that barcode scanning for meal logging will be exclusively for premium members beginning October 2022 and immediately deleted the app.

The barcode scanner was the most useful part of MFP, but I’m not paying a premium just to have that functionality. If MFP was the only tracking app in existence it might be a persuasive way to get me to commit to paying for it, but MFP is far from the only company to offer tracking and logging.

“We never like to disappoint our members. While it was a difficult decision, this change allows us to continue to improve our product offerings, focus resources, and deliver excellent service to our community.”

This is a direct quote from the email about it, and I immediately deleted MFP entirely after reading it. It is not improving product offerings and delivering excellent service to take away the most convenient feature for anyone unwilling to pay a subscription fee. It’s delivering services and offerings to PAYING members. I do not want anything to do with any company that uses this kind of doublespeak because it’s just slimy.

It’s not the early days of the Internet and app markets anymore - plenty of competitors exist, and I encourage everyone to find a competitor they like and switch to them. I am sick of everything in life requiring an endless, ongoing subscription and I won’t support companies that try to force people into one by tanking their broader offerings.I’ve had MyFitnessPal for over ten years. It was my tried and true app that I always used to track my weight loss. It was very successful and easy using the app….until they keep taking everything away. The app is basically no longer free. I’m on the go all the time and the scan feature was the best to quick log my food and weigh it on my scale. Now, it takes me 5-10 minutes to try to find the exact food product I need and log it. 

With rising inflation and cost of living, it is hard to justify $20 on an app for the ease of taking a picture. It’s extremely selfish to do. If anyone is looking for a free app with better tracking, use MacrosFirst!!

It absolutely breaks my heart leaving an app/company who has helped me through ten years of my life, but I can’t support an company that is taking of advantage of people and being just plain greedy. I’m glad they emailed me and gave me a heads up so I could make a switch to a new app and learn their new features.I have been using this app off and on for a few years depending on my routine and it’s always been a good, basic tool to see where you are at with calories and macros, without being tied to a specific program and their tracking method (like WW for example, which tracks points).  Even my dietician recommended it as I was trying to navigate switching off WW and getting back to actual tracking of food and activity and not points conversion. Now that the barcode scanner has moved to a premium only feature; I’m out. As others have said, tracking can be hit or miss, I’ve found several to be incorrect, even with multiple entries, and my activity has never synced correctly to my Apple Watch. This app has never been seamless and accurate enough that I would pay for it - there are plenty of others out there who can offer mediocre tracking for free, that you don’t need to pay for this one that is also inconsistent and full of ads.I used to love this app; it was my go-to for my friends, the fitness pal blog, tracking my fitness journey... I even went to premium in May 2020.

But there are some SERIOUS functionality issues with the app:

1. It needs to be fast, but almost every day I open it - I get stuck in an update screen for 5-10 minutes when I just need to get moving with my day.

2. Bugs! I’m constantly running into functionality issues where the app crashes, entries don’t save, my log screen kicks me out to to the home menu, and it’s extra-finicky whether it’s going to bring in my workout data.

3. Slow. The app can be very slow and cumbersome with how quickly it allows additional inputs or entries after completing another; it’s like it was designed to register input at the speed of someone that doesn’t understand how technology works. 
**Examples:
Quickly copying over a meal from the previous day only works once with the swipe, after that, you have manually enter the next meal 
AND
If you’re quickly swiping to remove multiple entries from a meal, there is a 1-2 second required delay that the user has to wait through before removing the next, otherwise you get thrown to the previous day.

I’m on an iPhone X and shouldn’t be running into any performance issues like these and this app has taken a serious downturn over the past 3 months - these need to get sorted out ASAP.This app constantly gives issues, and there is no phone number to call for help. At this point I’ve paid for a years worth for the premium version and the app reflects the original version. I’ve used this app for years and multiple features don’t work. I’ve been tracking through a reverse diet for 8 months now, and would like to cut now just before my wedding, but I can’t track the things I need most because the features are unusable - at the time I need them most. Oh also, all my data for the last 2 years was erased. 

I can’t stand paying for something and not being able to use it, and getting no response from them in return. 

If anyone is reading this from Under Armour or MyFitnessPal, you need to address these issues. It terrible there’s not support line to call. I’ll continue to review on other platforms until you feel like paying attention and this gets resolved. This is not the first review I’ve seen like this.My Fitness Pal used to be THE app for tracking calories and nutrition. 8 years ago I used the app to great success in losing well over 100 pounds. It had great value for free users but also premium features for those who were more serious about tracking their nutrition. Unfortunately, those days are long gone. The app now feels something akin to a low effort mobile game; intrusive ads constantly pop up and interrupt your actions. I understand needing to recoup revenue on free users, but ads use to be restricted to small banners that didn’t interrupt your experience; now they ruin it completely. They also have made the decision to cut out free features, which have been in the app for many years, and lock them behind their premium option (barcode scanning for example). This is corporate greed at its finest. They will obviously explain their rationale in a polite, consumer friendly way, but this is corporate greed and as anti-consumer as it gets.I never write reviews. I’m a long time supporter of this app and have recommended it to countless people over the years. I have a 3288 day streak on MFP and for the majority of that time it’s been great! However, as of the last year it has gotten progressively worse. I understand the ads. Even the ones that take up the entire screen.. annoying but I can deal. The straw that broke most of the camels backs is going to be taking features that have been free for years and putting them behind a paywall in a sad attempt to get more users to buy your premium subscription. I could see doing that with new features but rarely.. if ever does a major feature even get implemented on the app. Maybe searching for new foods will be next to be put behind the subscription. I can see why many users are switching to other apps. MyFitnessPal is not headed in a good direction and hasn’t been for some time now.It is completely within the rights of MyFtinessPal’s parent company, Under Amour, to use an overhyped, buggy, and subpar update as a slippery excuse to hide a very popular feature behind a pay wall; and it is completely within our rights to absolutely drag them in their reviews. I figure they are expecting as much, but believe they have a large enough buffer of older, positive reviews to keep them at the top of the list until users forget what they were angry about. They’re probably right. But if you came here looking for a free macro tracking app, and had the foresight to sort reviews by ‘most recent’, let me save you from wasting your time. Although the outdated, “most helpful” reviews are glowing and make frequent mention of macro tracking in the ad-supported version, the most recent update makes macro tracking a premium feature—and thus, useless to me, and perhaps to you.I have almost a 3,000 day streak, but looking for better apps now. Lose It Now and Fooducate are looking better. 
It used to persist and stay on the Diary tab where EVERYTHING I do on the app resides. Now it defaults to the Dashboard each time I come back to the app, which I see no value in. It doesn’t update the nutrients I’m watching as I move throughout the day. Not sure why they won’t just let us keep the same tab we want to use. I think they believe the dashboard is super valuable, but I’m not seeing it. 
Now, additionally, when I open up to Nutrients, it defaults to Calories every time. That used to persist until recently. Frustrating. 
I opened a ticket and got some response about why I should be glad it’s working this way and how awesome the dashboard is, without directly addressing what I actually asked. 
Not sure it’s worth the $80 they now charge. If it weren’t for the enormous database of foods you can scan, I’d stop today.I’m done. I’ve used MFP for over a decade and it was tried and true and anytime I was near falling off the wagon, I always knew I could get back on track with this app, scan the barcode on my food, or take a pic of my food and calories would be adjusted. However since COVID and now inflation, MFP decided to charge premium for the bare minimum. I’m good. It’s sad to me that everyone (and every basic app) is now trying to monetize even to vulnerable populations and MFP is now no different than any app out there. Y’all used to be the leader in fitness and meal tracking over the others (because the app features were free for basic tracking, adding your movement and syncing with Fitbit or apple health). BUT NOW, to have basic features that were free before like the bar scanner now cannot be used without a premium account? And now I’m seeing and forced to watch A TON of ads before I can simply log a meal.  

Sorry… I’m good. Goodbye MFP.I have been using the premium version since December with great success. I’m tracking foods by macros or was until yesterday. I’ve been charged twice for the Premium version this month so I asked Apple to refund one of those charges. As soon as they did, MFP asks me to go Premium again. My premium features are gone! I only see the free version even though I’ve paid for Premium!!! But wait there’s more!

I’ve submitted 4 tickets through the App Support link and have only received automated emails with tips on how to fix login issues. Logging in isn’t the problem! Nevertheless, I followed their trouble-shooting steps and have lost my history since December! Which wouldn’t matter except my coach needs that info since I’m cutting!!!! I haven’t been able to accurately track my macros for two days now.  The app isn’t working and the Support isn’t there for customers who rely on it for prepping for a competition as of yesterday!I don’t understand how this app can miss the one simple thing it should be able to do and that’s TRACK! It does not add my workouts no matter how many times I go into the settings to allow it in my health app to track it, turning it off and on again doesn’t do the trick. It adds my steps but not my work outs 🤯. I work out at night, so before midnight hits and after I am done with my work out I try for it to upload and most of the time it will not load it, and then sometimes out of the blue it will recognize my workout and upload it, but it has to be done before the next day or it will just ignore it and will not upload it to that previous day, defeating the very purpose of tracking. Other apps don’t have a problem tracking my past workouts. How can this be difficult to program in and how can you miss the mark on not doing this when this is what it should do. Blows my mind.UPDATE: I went to download MY OWN DATA and in order to save it I have to PAY for it with a premium subscription?! I’m furious. I guess it will be screenshots because I’m not giving you a dime.

I’ve been tracking my weight and workouts on MyFitnessPal since 2011. But you got greedy. Selling user’s personal info to third parties to be used across the internet with no boundaries, taking up half of the screen with an ad that we can’t even close to see our data, and charging a ridiculous amount to not see them is not worth it to me. I don’t even know why you spend so much time composing a privacy policy when you could just say “our privacy policy: you have none.” There are plenty of other apps that are not exploiting their users by taking their eating habits weight, name, email address, birthdate, and using it to make money. Sadly, I’m going to take my data and find an app who cares about their users.I have been using MyFitnessPal every single say for logging food and exercise since 2018.  I have stuck with the app thanks to it’s great UI, extensive food database and it’s respect for its users by offering a free version that is still above and beyond it’s paid counterparts.

That is why I must write this review in mourning, as the bean counters behind the app have decided to strip the free version of any feature that it could instead monetize.

In addition to intrusive pop-up ads that now appear anytime food is logged, users have just been informed that the barcode scanning feature will no longer be available for free users starting October 1st.  This feature is incredibly helpful in helping me have the most accurate nutrition data in my daily calorie logging, and there is absolutely no reason outside of financial greed for the free version of the app to lose access to it.

As the title suggests, this is the death of an otherwise tremendous app.  I do not exaggerate in saying I have used this every day for the last 4 years (I currently am at a streak of over 1000 days), so it saddens me to be forced away from something that has simply turned rotten.

MyFitnessPal, if you are reading this, please come to your senses.  Stop the penny-pinching and do the right thing to stay in good standing with your users.  Otherwise, you may lose them forever.Free Version - You know, the basic functionality like tracking a few calories and seeing the constant commercials. That version is great and 5 stars no problem. 

Premium Version @ $20/month: negative 10 stars to say the least.  I have used the app for 24 days straight taking advantage of every premium feature down to macro nutrition. Even calculating my water intake down to the ounce and the fibers down to the grams. I have created meals, workout routines, exported files, and took the app through the ringer. At $20/month this is a pethatic excuse of a user design that crashes all the time. If they cancelled out all the 5 star reviews from the free version users, I bet you this app would have a rating of about 1.2 stars in their best day.  Not only because in crashes, it lacks friendliness. 
Here is one stupid example. If you add chicken as a lunch meal and eat that every day for a week. One day you get busy at work and you end up eating that chicken for dinner instead. Guess what, you can’t add yesterday’s lunch as today’s dinner, I have to re-add the entire meal again (not even copy/paste) to claim it as today’s dinner!!!

Adding a workout routine? Good luck finding the right one from the list!! They have a feature that recognizes my food with a pictures, but their 10,000 list of workouts do not have a simple seated dips to pick from!!!I’ve used MFP for about 8 years and loved how intuitive it was to use for a beginner just getting into calorie tracking. I’ve recommended this app to friends and family in the past a myriad of times because of how user friendly it was. However, recently the app has a new type of ad that constantly berates the user with full-screen-size ads that require you to wait a bit for a small “X” or “Close” button to appear before you can continue using the app. This is incredibly frustrating to deal with because these ads pop up whenever the user changes screens (like swapping from home to diary) or when inputting a food item in the diary. I’ve decided to step away from this app despite being a supporter of it for many years because this form of aggressive ad usage creates a horrible user experience that detracts from the convenience of the app.Before I start, MAKE NO MISTAKE: they get plenty of money even from “free” users as they at a minimum run ads and sell data based on usage.

Now, the app used to be relative useful to me. However, countless (previously free) features have been paywalled, turning the navigation and use of this app from a once easy and helpful process into a painful slog. I don’t have the time or space here to go into every detail but will instead cover at single feature as a case study. Let’s look exercise calories. 

For most people serious about maintaining a specific caloric intake, any daily targets already take into account exercise expenditure, i.e. you don’t want to add these expenditures as a “bonus” beyond the daily target. However, if you have any apps with workout tracking connected to this one (or accidentally allow it to track your steps), you CANNOT turn off adding estimated caloric expenditure beyond your daily target without a pro account. 

Sure it’s just more math to figure in, but it kind of defeats the point of having a hard caloric target to strive for. And it’s a major point of friction added to what used to be a smooth experience. One of many that have, again, been implement in order to artificially increase the pain of using the free app.

Pretty disappointed in the morals of the developer.Was truly enjoying this app, recommending it to everyone I know and then they decided to make the barcode feature a paid only feature. This feature has literally been free for YEARS & all of the sudden it’s a paid only feature. Having the barcode capability is one of the few actually truly helpful features behind this app when compared to other apps in the market and they are so greedy they decided to up and suddenly make it a paid only feature. Not only that the fee is so egregious. For an app that claims to “make it easier for everyone to live healthier life by tracking meals & physical activity” you really alienated a majority of your users by making your app only user friendly for those who can afford to do so. So much for “everyone”. So disappointing, will be switching to a different app and sharing with anyone I recommended this crappy app to to do the same.The app used to be great when it offered things like showing breakdowns of macros and using the barcode scanner to help make tracking simple, for free.

I am not a fan of locking old features behind a paywall all in the name of profit. Disappointed to see greed be the focus point. Everything about health and fitness is expensive and they don’t make it any easier for your wallet. I already have too many subscriptions to services as more continue to pop up or others start locking certain features behind pay walls. Personally not a fan.

I will say the app has a large repository of foods and brands so that is great, and has many other features people find useful, however I am still disappointed in the paywall folks are forced into in order to access features that help make something that is already a challenge, that could be simple, instead be a money grab.This used to be my go to tracker, I am just using my health app now. It took me days to find just the simple weight tracker. Why?, because the entire front screen is ads. Ads for their premium, and rando ads that have nothing to do with fitness. The ellipses at the bottom show you are suppose to swipe left and right, but all the info tracking, you have to scroll DOWN to get to. The developers snarky comments to people leaving and using other apps because of the changes seems childish. Why would you make it a challenge to see/track everything and then be obnoxious about the premium upgrade? I can’t see anything ? Why would I upgrade? 
Well, this review has been a waste of 5 minutes for an app I’m not going to use anymore, and the developer is just going to leave a “thanks for all the years you were with us” comment.I used to use this app for years.  Paid for premium for a year or two a while back, but didn’t use most of the features.   Stopped using for a year or more but came back recently because I wanted to track my macros for a bit.   I was willing to see all the ads to use it for just a bit to get me back in a groove. But now the free version is inconvenient.  Really? Have to pay to use the scanner after all this time?   Lots of better free versions out there… CarbManager, MyNetDiary are two examples.  When I do want to pay again, I’ll go to those instead too.  I’ll support who makes things easy and convenient without charging me for just the basics.  I get the developers want to make a little more money, but when you’re the most recommended, number one tracking app for years, why shoot yourself in the foot?  SMH.A bad app and getting worse by the day. Some idiot at MFP who’s been put in charge of important decisions started cramming “premium” (very expense to some people…including me!) down our throats. Nutrition tracking started tracking less and then popups got out of control. Now the scanner feature is being taken away! Last nail in the coffin MFP. The latest update is horrible!! This app is only “okay” at best anyway. There are TONS and TONS of mistakes and errors in nutrition information since anyone (including idiots, evidently!!) is allowed to put in whatever they want, and information is not confirmed or verified. Now, with the new update the app is completely NOT user friendly! Horrible!! Horrible!!. Horrible! I kept this app ONLY for the recipe creation which allowed you to barcode items into your recipes    And now that is gone, and so is MFP. DO NOT TRUST THIS APP! It’s full of junk!I have had this app since 2014. That is almost 10 years. Recently, the entire screen is taken up by ads that you have to wait to close, some of which are even in different languages so you have to guess which box is “no thanks” and will close the ad. Before there were ads but nowhere near this bad. Also, they are taking away the scanner which every other calorie tracking app still has for free. I’m afraid this app’s popularity/takeover by Underarmour has left it as a terrible experience for users. I literally try to open it as little as possible & am making the transition to Lose It, another app that still has the scan function. Not fair to take away since users built the database & really money hungry thing to do MFP. I would recommend making your life easier - make the switch to another app sooner rather than later.I’ve used My Fitness Pal for years and loved it.  When I’ve needed the extra tools I’ve paid the premium fee, but also used the free version for times when I wasn’t as focused on training and nutritional tracking.   I recently started using it again after a brief hiatus and it’s changed significantly.  The number of nutritional inaccuracies is off the charts.  And the number of steps you need to go through to log has expanded.  The barcode scanner used to work really well, but this morning only 1/2 the things I scanned were recognized.  These were items I’ve used for years and have scanned before.  

I’m not sure what they’re thinking with these changes, but please bring back the old version. I’d be a premium member again in a second.  But for now, I’m searching for a new app.I used this app 8 or so years ago. It was great. It was clean, easy to use. The exchange of having a wide expanse of features was paid by collecting my data for small target ads and user based contributions to the database.
Then it sold to UA. Ads got bigger and more complicated tracking went to paid ($20 mo to $80 yr). Ok, but basic features still worked. However the data base was still user contributed but now ""verified"".
Now basic features are becoming locked to be paid. Can't scan barcodes anymore, even though that database was created by users, users who will now have to pay to access the data they contributed.
Like most app developers, their goal isn't to wow you with great features to subscribe but to annoy you to the point you either subscribe or find something else.I have been using MFP for almost a decade now, and recent changes are making it so that I may begin using a different tracking app. 

1. I hate that the barcode scanner is now a paid feature. Lots of other apps have this feature for free, and it’s pretty crummy to take something that has been a free feature for years and now make it a premium feature. This feels like a blatant attempt to get users to pay for a premium subscription, only to utilize things they previously didn’t need to spend $20 a month on. 

2. As others mentioned, the increase in ridiculous ads is insane. Small banner ads, or ads in the timeline on your homepage are fine. We get it, it’s an easy way to make money. However, the frequency and clickbait nature of the ads has gotten SO MUCH worse. Ads when you open the app, ads after logging individual items, and every other post on the timeline is an ad. And so many of them are the “One weird trick doctors don’t want you to know..” type ads. Just the worst kind of cringey clickbait out there. 

So anyways, MFP has gone downhill, and after years and years of use, I’m pretty ready to move on and find another tracking app unless some major changes happen.I was using this to plan all of my foods I eat and activities I do for 3 days for a diet plan in my nursing nutrition class. I couldn’t even make it past day 1 without being so confused on how it works. You put in your height and weight and I can’t find anywhere where it recommends your DRIs for vitamins. The set up is so confusing and I consider myself tech savvy. Tracking activities by having your Apple Watch is so hard too. It’s almost impossible to come upon an “intake average” of all the food you consumed in one day. I even paid for the premium to make it easier on me and it’s just so confusing. There’s sooo many buttons and options that over complicate things. I think simple is better when it comes to tracking nutrition. No one wants to get lost in an app just trying to find out what their daily intake for a vitamin should be lol.This used to be a great app, and was my favorite for meal tracking until recently, when they removed the ability to use the barcode scanner for anyone who didn’t pay for the premium version of the app. In an attempt to force money out of long time loyal users they locked what was a free feature behind a paywall and have now made it significantly more difficult to log food and meals. I would not suggest downloading this app if you can avoid it until they restore the barcode scanner for all users.
UPDATE: Developer replied to this app providing what they claimed was a link to an explanation for why they pay-walled the barcode scanner. When I clicked the link it went to a page that said the link was deleted or suspended. Another top notch move by the devs. (That’s sarcasm by the way)Had this app for years. Was off the app for about a year and a half because life got in the way, but decided to go back on to get healthier. Typical nutrition journey story. Went back on today to find the interface had changed (makes sense -it’s been a while and maybe they improved things, I thought…Sadly, that was NOT the case. A paywall jumps up every time I push ANY buttons. The barcode scanner was free,  now no longer free (obviously that’s the way they are trying to get users to pay for the $20 a month subscription) ~Maybe~ that’s a fair price if you live in certain cities, but for many that price is gauging. And for what? To get back something that was already free (barcode scan) and to reduce ads while still making $$ anyway tracking us? Unethical. Sigh, Guess I need to find a new logging app…Have been using mfp since 2015 and the app used to be great. It’s how I got through college. However, the downside of using an app for so many years is watching the company change….and oh boy has mfp changed! Many of the features that were once free now come at a price. Tracking anything on the app now take 3x as long since you have to manually input the food (no more bar scanner) and wait for every ad to pass. On top of that, the cost of the subscription has increased drastically over the last few years. There are better quality apps out their that simply outperform mfp in every way and for a much more reasonable price. Mfp used to be great and I will be forever grateful for the start on the nutrition path it gave me, but I will not use nor recommend the corrupt, money hungry company it has become.ETA: moved on to Lose It! 🙌🏼👍🏼👏🏼
MyFitnessPal has made a horrible choice to make previously free content now be moved behind a paywall. From what I’ve seen, the backlash has been unbelievable (and fully justified). However, so far there have been no signs of relenting and putting the barcode scanner back where all users can access. Instead of being a helpful resource, a great way to simplify tracking food intake (which is already a huge chore), it has now become an app obsessed with ads, making life harder for its patrons, and money-hungry. Maybe in the past MyFitnessPal had a corner on the market, but there are tons of other tracking apps available now, and I’m going to be using them instead. Sincerely, A long-term user who is over this and moving on. Buh-bye.I’ve tried working with it for over a week and it has become a dread to open the app. The ease of entering weight and quick add is gone. It is literally more time consuming and harder now to track and enter data. 

The lack of care from the company and developers about the amount of people upset with the update is concerning. I have used MyFitnessPal since 2013 and this is the worse update of them all. I have given it time. I don’t care if you want to make it all pretty, that fine but don’t take away the ease of adding and tracking data. Even with the new update I was disappointed to see you still haven’t addressed the issues you created. It’s time to move on to a different app and developers that listen to their users, especially long term users.MyFitnessPal has slowly been introducing minor annoyances to its experience in an effort to be more profitable. It started with ads being shown to users randomly but commonly when moving between interfaces. But recently, barcode scan searching, a core feature of this calorie tracker which is what made me start using MyFitnessPal, was transitioned to be a part of the $20 monthly premium package. I’m done with these annoyances, I’ll take my calorie tracking elsewhere.

Do not download this app, find an alternative, MyFitnessPal wants your money. Its developers will keep implementing more and more disgusting changes until it wears you down enough to either pay an exorbitant amount of money for premium or to simply delete the app.

Don’t bother with this prime example of corporate greed.I used MyFitnessPal for many years on and off when I needed to be really diligent in tracking calories, macros, etc for diet purposes. It was great to create custom foods and it saved commonly eaten foods for meals so that you could add them quickly. It also has a super handy barcode scanner to quickly add nutrition info. 

However, now when I try to search for a food it won’t let me! It says it is in “offline mode” even though I am connected to both WiFi and cellular data. I even tried to sync the app and then delete and reinstall it. Syncing the app did NOT save the meals I had logged for the day, even though customer service said it would, and deleting and reinstalling the app did not solve the “offline mode” issue. I am extremely disappointed with MyFitnessPal and feel that I have no choice but to download a competitor app.I have used this app on and off for years and it seems that the price has gone up but the quality down. Like other reviewers mentioned, you now have to pay to scan barcodes, and when I manually look up items, more often than not, the macros and other nutrition info is off, sometimes WAY off. This has been a main factor as to why I have been hesitant to upgrade to a paid version, after being a paid customer in the past. Even when I notice this miscalculation, I can never find the item with the correct info. When people are tracking macros, it is already a little extra time out of their day to count, measure and track their food (which is why some people don’t do it) and MFP just makes the process more challenging. Please do better!MFP use to be great. It was helpful in losing weight and tracking calories but over time they never updated the UI, they kept bringing in more and more ads that caused glitches in the software and most recently they introduced a paywall to scan barcodes, an integral part I used for almost a decade.  In addition, the algorithm to help reduce calories did not hold up well with the connection of other apps causing to many additional calories to be added.

I switched to Lose It and found it much more user friendly with a better algorithm to calculate the calories that is showing very good results. I did end up purchasing the subscription with Lose It to to gain additional functionality but was much cheaper overall than MFP.

Really disappointed with how MFP turned out.I have used this app for years and now it seems the greed for subscription services has taken over. Seriously I have to pay to use the barcode scan to log in my food diary??? Obviously the company does not have the customers best interest in mind. They should know the most difficult part of tracking your diet is just the act of entering the food. Making the users have to type in each item to search for their entry is just discouraging and most won’t even bother. Great job keeping your customers interest in mind. (Sarcasm) I’ll move onto another app that allows users to utilize their ease of food entry by way of barcode scans to keep track of my diet. MyFitnessPal is such a disappointment now that they fell to the greed of subscriptions.It seems like the company must be struggling.   They are slowly but continuously making their app useless unless you are willing to pay.  They forget that tons of people just want the basic calorie tracking capabilities and could care less about all of the other bells and whistles.   The issue is that it’s a nightmare to use if you are one of the “free” users.   Ads everywhere, manual entry of all foods, no barcode scanning.   The other issue is the cost.  Their app is like 10x more expensive than some of the other great apps.  Do they forget they are not the only app out there?   There are other apps that are much better and still free.  Don’t waste you’re time with this one.  I predict they will lose their “top spot” in the tracking industry.   And it won’t take long either…. Sad.I’m so bummed! I’ve been using My Fitness Pal for years and I’ve always loved their extensive food library and ease of use, namely the barcode scanner. The barcode scanner used to be free, but now they made it a premium feature. Fine, it’s one of the best features, except premium is now so expensive; $20 a month (which is ridiculous) or $80 a year (which is so much out of pocket for a tracking app). I’d pay $6-$9 a month for the now premium barcode scanner, but that’s not an option. It just feels like My Fitness Pal is keeping healthy habit making and fitness out of reach for many, especially when fitness is already an expensive industry. Come on, My Fitness Pal, make your app accessible, or at least approachable, or I guess I’ll go back to tracking my food and exercise on paper.Knocked off a star for not interfacing with Apple Health for water tracking because I use a hydration tracking app that doesn’t pair with MFP (WaterLlama) and for not allowing for tracking of Vitamin B12. Also, I hate that the vitamins and minerals are in percentages causing me to reverse calculate as men and women have different iron goals and so do pregnant women. 

Been a premium member of LoseIt for over a decade and finally made the switch since they still haven’t allowed for added sugar and iron tracking. However, LoseIt does allow for water tracking via AppleHealth and their insights, meal planning features, and overall app layout and aesthetic are better for me.

Edit: Oh noooo, MFP also doesn’t track added sugar, not sure why the article I read said that did. Fooducate does but that app is super clunky. I’m at a loss.This is the OG calorie tracking app. It used to be best and unique. But now apps like this are everywhere. You don’t have to use this one. Before you really needed to and most features were free with the ads. But now even basic features like scan bar codes are only available to premium members. And their premium isn’t cheap. You can find many other calorie trackers that allow you to this basic function for free. Unfortunately for me I’m trapped in this ecosystem with 10 years of results and history. If I can ever find another app that will import a csv, I’ll pay premium long enough to export my data, get it in a different app, and say goodbye to these greedy extortionist.

Edit: Lose it.  An app that doesn’t charge 3 times what is worth for basic functionality.Another company bought out by another large one and ruins a product. How fun! I was a user of this app for 7+ years. I am so disappointed in the quality of the app. Instead of them creating new content and improving the app, they instead lock current features behind a paywall and ask for a ridiculous amount of money for what the app is. Also, making the UI not user friendly, mainly because they wanted to fit more ads and act like they are making positive changes. 

There is no reason to continue using MyFitnessPal. The company is greedy and does not care about the app anymore. Switch to Lose It or MyPlate if you want a better experience. Come on, guys! You had the lead on weight loss and food tracking apps! The greed will only destroy you.I have used my fit pal for like 7 years now. And it was my go to app. But with the most recent update I can’t even CONVENIENTLY track my food anymore. They put the barcode scan behind a paywall. I understand the paywall for their previous features that help make the app more personalized to you. Still annoying don’t get me wrong, but At least I could understand why. But I felt like this paywall feature was uncalled for. All the barcode does is make it more convenient to add new foods. But with the removal of it it makes adding new foods that much more tedious. Tracking calories is already a tedious process so why would they do something to slow down that process even more. Makes no sense. Definitely gonna be looking for a new app, and I’d recommend you guys do the same.Have been a myfitnesspal user since around 2017. It was a huge help and got 17 year old me to lose around 80 pounds when I needed it most. Still have been using it all these years even now when I’m trying to gain weight rather than lose it. 

That said, I got an email today letting me know that the barcode scanning feature will now be locked behind their premium subscription. I’ve used premium before, it’s nice. But you shouldn’t have to pay just to scan a barcode.

I’ll be looking for another app now. Callously locking such features behind a paywall shows me that MyFitnessPal a.) cares more about money than your health b.) is not consumer friendly and c.) cannot possibly win me over when there are a litany of other food tracking apps out there.I would have rated it 5 stars but they just changed it the other day to where you can no longer scan barcodes for free. This used to be a free feature and now it forces you to pay monthly to use the feature. I think this is a ridiculous move considering how basic of a feature it is. I’m looking for another tracking app to use as scanning barcodes is the one thing I need as a basic function because most items I buy never come up when I search but would work when scanned. Now I cannot track anything because I can’t scan it and it won’t show up when I try to search it. I can also no longer add scanned items into the database which is very very limiting. Deleting this app and moving on to the next!I started using this app 11 years ago and it changed my life. Those days are gone; MFP slowly killed everything that made the app great. Functionality was reduced and user experience became awful (particularly after the app was purchased by an investment group). The MFP database is great, thanks to their large and dedicated user base adding and cleaning data over the years. However, I expect this too will degrade over time: users who know better will migrate to other platforms, and more and more garbage data will be written. 

I’m pretty sure they’re killing their golden goose (and damaging users’ ability to track their health) but who cares if shareholders make an extra $2 this quarter, amirite? 

There are better tracking apps out there that won’t extort you.I’m giving this up one star but I wish I could give it zero because I was using this app and enjoying its features and so they decided to upgrade the app or update the app and no you are not allowed to use the food scan barcode option to add your meals. I’m extremely angry I didn’t use this app for a lot of tracking just to keep track of my protein and calories and now it’s so much harder to track my food because searching for food is another disaster because half of the things on there don’t have the correct protein or calories or name which is what made the scan barcode future so much better I am not paying $20 a month do use the food scan barcode feature. I’m very upset and I wish I could give this zero stars.This app used to work great, but in the past 12 months it has progressively worsened each month. First it was the advertisements popping up here and there. Then the interface was redesigned to near-universal dislike. And now, the last remaining helpful feature - the barcode scanner - has been moved to only be accessible to premium users. So if you want an easy way to enter your meal info, you need to pay upwards of $20 per month. 

So long, MFP. You were tremendously helpful in getting my calorie tracking to become a daily habit, but you are no longer worth it. I highly recommend users try the app LoseIt; it has a similar interface, is easy to learn how to use, and doesn’t require a premium membership to use the barcode scanner.This is app is now $20/mo and rising! Hilarious considering the users provide the content—did you know that every barcode you scan only populates because users like me added the nutrients by hand?! The only reason the app exists is because of work that the users put in, and now the app wants to charge you $20/mo, when you can go to a massive planet fitness gym for $10/mo. 

The interface is riddled with ads, pop-ups asking to go premium literally every 20-30 seconds. Maybe worth $2/mo is you’re in serious food-tracking mode, but this app shouldn’t be used by ANYONE at even $5/mo. Still doesn’t have food entries for a huge number of barcodes, saving your own meals/recipes is still hilariously janky, etc

Oh how the mighty have fallen. 1/10, would not recommend.I used to use MyFitnessPal on and off I was 20-something. I’m 32 now. The last couple years I’ve witnessed this app going. And it keeps getting worse. Taking away the barcode ? Really how cheap can you guys really be? Woooow…. 
I need to subscribe to use the barcode? THE BARCODE??? Hahahahaha. Nope. 😐 I’m not paying to use a friggin barcode. Get real. 

We do you the favor of using this app, tracking our locations, using our data , etc etc. You should be paying us!! 

I’ve used the app cuz it’s convenient but it’s certainly not important/special enough to pay for. Never was and never will be … ESPECIALLY for the amount you ask. 
$1/year subscription maybe I would think about it. Maybe. 
You guys definitely don’t offer *anything* worth paying $80+ per year. 

I know how to count calories, I know how to count macros, I can keep a log of my weight, and I know how to meal plan, and other health/fitness stuff. 

And if I needed help with anything like that, guess what.. I have health insurance that will assist me with all of it and give me rewards for doing so.

Any more ridiculous penny-gouging alterations then I’m just deleting the app.I've been using the app since 2014. Great app, and I liked the free barcode scanning feature. It irks me to see them arbitrarily move barcode scanning to the ""premium"" version. Seriously, this feature needed no update, but developers thought they might be able to squeeze some extra premium revenue out of people by making the feature available only to premium users.

If they keep this up, they'll probably start hiding macros from free users as well. If you don't care about tracking macros, use an app like ""Lose It"" instead. It has a much nicer interface, plus their food entries are vetted that you don't get a mess of false food labels like you do with MyFitnessPal's food database. Plus, ""Lose It"" has a free barcode scanner...I’ve been a Premium user for a few years for many reasons. I love the ability to adjust my macros and calories by day etc. They a couple of years ago they removed the ability to share foods with another person which stinks as you may or may not know because when you take the time to create the whole meal and you want to share it with loved ones who are also tracking for health there is now no option. Recently ERRORS come up when trying to import recipes or even create one. This is super disappointing and utterly ridiculous as the premise of getting healthy is not only tracking but cooking at home. ***Developers!!! Please fix the recipe import AND bring back share! Sincerely a faithful user since 2009 but very disappointed one.I’ve used this app for years and it used to be the best for my uses (just calorie tracking mostly). But over the years, it’s consistently gotten worse and worse. More intrusive ads, weird UI designed to try and force you into the paid version, and just generally more sleazy. The final straw for me was paywalling the barcode scan feature.

I wouldn’t even mind paying for premium but the pricing is outrageous at $20 a month (after their promo ends) for something that used to be free

There are much better apps out there than MyFitnessPal now a days that do everything better at a cheaper price. If you’re looking for a barcode scanning nutrition tracker and don’t want to be ripped off, look elsewhere.I’ve already move this app as a secondary app to view some tracking data since the ads were getting more and more in the way of using the app. I no longer log data directly in MFP. After the update, the dashboard isn’t even in a good enough state for me to come back and view my weight chart. Scrolling up and down have very noticeable delays and freezes. Clicks/touch is not even responsive. 
Reasons the other app received my subscription: free usage let’s me do the basic without intrusive ads so I actually get a pleasant experience, additional features made the application even more useful, it actually has an acceptable user experience. 
Mfp was useable 10+ years ago but the intrusive ads just slowly pushed me away.I have been using this app for about five years. it is an awesome motivator for tracking food intake losing weight. However. This year they started getting aggressive with their ads and the ads will interrupt logging. I also got an email that says you will no longer have access to scan in your meals unless you pay. I get that they need to have funding somehow and I don't mind them asking for payment for scanning in meals - it's a convenience. But it's really annoying now that the ads cover half the screen and even multiple times will interrupt logging in meals. A much less aggressive campaign to get me to pay would have been more productive. I'm considering leaving because this is unacceptable ad pushing.I’ve used this app 4-5 times since 2013 to help me shed pounds and get my diet back on track when I started to balloon. 

The app’s ease of use to load nutritional facts using a barcode and long term tracking ability has been really beneficial for me. However, when I go to load a food using a barcode this morning, it is now included in the premium service only. 

It was bad enough to start seeing ads pop up from time to time, but, I get it, need to make money. Fine. But taking away the biggest selling point of the app for a subscription? No thank you. I’ll be using up my free 1-month trial while I look for a cheaper food logging app. I assume in the past 9 years there has been some competition arise.MyFitnessPal was king for a long time, but they’ve gotten greedy and are steadily making the free version of the app less and less usable, between incredibly obnoxious ads like those you see in cheaply made mobile games and moving long-free features to subscription only. On the subscription, they’re asking for an absurd amount for what little it provides. As of writing this review, the subscription is $20/month which is equivalent to a premium subscription to Netflix (which allows for four concurrent users.) It’s insane how anyone at this company can justify charging what they do and doing little to make it remotely worth it or the free version usable. Deleting my MFP account today and trying another calorie tracking app, probably LoseIt.New update is terrible!  Tapping on anything causes it to freeze up. The weight tracker is at the bottom and must be scrolled down to which causes app to freeze. Put daily weight in and it freezes, then closes on its own. If you want to compare to year ago, it will only show you the graph. You have to open and close weight section multiple times before it will show number values when comparing timelines. This update is an utter failure. The tool bar at the bottom is in the way. All the social media parts seem to be the focus now. We have too many social media apps!  We need a good weight and food tracking app. Appreciate if anyone has a recommendation. After 11 years here I’m ready to goWhy do you have to be a paid member just to scan barcodes? This used to be a free feature of the app but has since become something you must pay for. I’ve been using MyFitnessPal off/on for over a decade now and this seems like a very greedy move on the app developer’s part. Please make this feature accessible for ALL of your users, as it renders the app essentially unusable without it. There are a lot of meal tracking apps now and the only reason why I’ve used MyFitnessPal for so long was for the ease of adding meals. There are better apps that provide the same service with more intuitive interfaces. I think this move will hurt the company in the long run. Please reconsider this business choice, guys!Great concept, executed well in some areas, but can be frustrating to use when creating recipes and tracking food. There have been bugs when syncing the app with the Fitbit tracker that render it useless until they resolve, which usually takes days. I find that nearly every time I scan a barcode to log food or create a recipe, the information is inaccurate. I’m not sure if this is because MyFitnessPal doesn’t know how to enter the information or because they allow users to “correct” nutritional facts and most people are stupid. You’ll want to review each entry carefully before saving. If MyFitnessPal could clean up their nutritional database and permanently resolve the syncing issues with Fitbit, it would move my rating to a five star.I have used this app for over 5 years having used the premium and free version and it has been very helpful to my health and well being BUT suddenly without warning they removed the barcode scanning from the free version and are now charging for it. Please reverse this decision. It is really disappointing, frustrating and feels like a betrayal of all of us users who have been using this app for years. I had actually been considering getting my premium subscription back but now I feel coerced into it by this removal of functionality and I don’t think I will purchase the premium version. Instead I’m likely to start exploring other meal tracking apps. There are a lot of other options.They’ve been slowly hiding more and more features behind a pay wall, features that used to be free. Most didn’t really effect the basic features of the app, but now they’ve hidden the barcode search behind a paywall and are trying to pretend like it’s a neat new feature that they’ve just added. After a 1062 day streak of using this app, I am now migrating to Lose It! 

Update: I already saw your spammy response on the cavalcade of other 1 star ratings since October 1st. It’s garbage. Trash. Useless. Shoddy. Worthless. Nobody else charges for this feature. If you actually cared about helping people lose weight, you’d remove these barriers. Enjoy your falling user base numbers. I’ve already ended using this app.I used myfitnesspal off and on since 2014 and the recent months have tarnished my opinion of their practice. I used to recommend this app to anyone pursuing various health/fitness goals. 
However, greed has finally taken over, as basic fundamental features are being placed behind a subscription paywall. All this comes after adding in obtrusive ads. I can roll with the punches, sure you need to make money off of your users. However, you seriously need to reconsider your cost for the premium plan if you expect people to buy in. 
Time to test drive other apps or I’ll go back to my manual spreadsheet tracking. Thank you for the good times, but I suppose all good things must come to an end.This has always been my favorite tracking app but with every new update, it gets worse and worse. The latest issue is logging food and it doesn't show up in the diary. When i select the food, i get the check mark and the message “food logged” but the diary is empty of food items. Sometimes it even adds the calories at the top of the page, but there is no food listed in the actual diary. Sometimes a couple of the foods items are listed but not all of them. Even if i delete all foods listed, the “invisible” food remains in the calorie count and i cant remove them bc the actual log of items doesnt exist anywhere.

If you’d like to read more about why we’re making this change, here’s a blog post that explains it **-** **https://rebrand.ly/barcode22**', 'modified': '2022-10-06T14:04:26Z'}","Several years ago, this app was the best out there when it came to tracking calories, nutrition and exercise data.  If you wanted to lose, maintain or gain weight, you could find a good way to make the app work for you. The UI was fairly intuitive.  There was a good ‘free’ service (‘free’ still cost your personal data of course), and an expensive but tolerable expanded service for those that needed to track more details or had some alternative dietary plans.

Over the past year plus, unfortunately, the company continues to make terrible decisions.  The UI was dramatically changed, and it became far more difficult to do the most basic tasks (for most people this was logging food, water, exercise and weight).  Bugs have become the norm.  Features have been reduced or eliminated, especially from the ‘free’ plan.  In short, the value plummeted, yet the price did not.

Now, after years of using this app, I and many others are moving on.  There are better apps out there that make it easy to log calories in and out.  There are still apps out there that let all users log food by scanning barcodes.  There are apps out there that offer more premium options for a much better price.  Like many companies out there. MFP became so focused on raising the price and forcing users into subscriptions, they forgot that if they don’t provide value, they’re just going to lose market share.  Hopefully they’ll change things around and we will see more value in the future.They got overly complicated.  This site has a great for helping people lose weight, but the most important part, the diet and weight monitors, became almost lost in the scrum of everything else they added onto their app a few years ago.  Nevertheless, MyFitnessPal was the primary tool I used to help me lose 120 pounds a few years back.

Now, a few years removed, and I need to lose some weight again.  Only to find that their premium package, which they were always begging me to get, now included the bar scan. What?!?!  It is nearly impossible to track calorie counts without the bar scan.  That’s not an inconvenience, that’s an essential.  This isn’t paying for a convenience.  It’s taking away an essential, creating a inconvenience, and forcing you to pay to not be inconvenienced.  And the premium package is an utterly exorbitant $20/month!!!  So I’m supposed to pay $20/month in order to use the bar scan?!?!?!

Unfortunately, even without the bar scan, I’m my opinion, it’s the most comprehensive site for calorie tracking available.  So even though it appears they’re actively trying to push app users away for some unknown reason, I’m stuck with them until someone else like Lose It either steps up their game or someone else entirely decides to be what MyFitnessPal originally was.  A simple, convenient way to keep track of calories.  Without being forced to go broke in the attempt.I had this app for a long time, stopped using it for several years and came back to it and now you have to pay for a premium membership to use what was free before and it’s really glitchy! I thought somehow I was screwing up but I see now from other reviews that many others have my same issue. Foods in the diary keep randomly duplicating and sometimes adding to previous days’ diaries. I added in something for today’s morning and it added it to yesterday instead of today and another item was duplicated. The barcode scanner is very limited, doesn’t work on most nutritional items and for me the worst thing is that it doesn’t track nutrients except for like 4 basic ones. I’m much more interested in tracking nutrition than calories or exercise which I did manually for years easily in a notebook. 

When you go over 100g of vitamin C it lists it in red like you did something terribly wrong. It reprimands you if your goal weight is less than what they think you should be even though I was that weight for years, was perfectly healthy and my doctor never once said I was underweight. It reprimands you if you go under 1000 calories for the day which is ridiculous, how can you lose weight eating more than 1000 calories? 

I have the free trial of the premium now and already cancelled it to make sure I don’t forget (you still get the free month). The weight should be lost by then anyway.I just tried this app after reading about it in a review for a different calorie tracking app, one I will continue to use instead of this. I created my account and went to enter my first meal, which includes 12g of sugar free Metamucil. I weigh all my food to make this easier. After scanning the barcode and pulling up the item, I see that I am unable to enter portion by gram. This is odd as the food label lists grams in a serving, so I check other Metamucil items in the database to see if that option is present. It is not. So I enter the tsp equivalent. Apparently “2 tsp(s)” is 30 calories, while “2 tsp” is 40... ok well 30 is the correct amount, however the app then shows incorrect carbs and fiber. To enter a generic banana by weight, I had to set serving size to 1 g and then enter 137.4 servings. As a developer that has also done a fair amount of quality assurance testing, if a simple method for entering portion by weight is available in this app, then I can confidently say the user interface in anything but intuitive. If the feature doesn’t exist, then it is hard to take this app seriously. A food scale allows an app like this to be much more accurate. I will stick to the app I’m already using, where I enter almost every item by weight, and the results match the label. Metamucil is not an obscure item. I should be able to scan a barcode and enter “11.6 grams”.This health/fitness/diet app claims to be comprehensive, but has a huge gap in its user experience for diabetics. There is no way to input blood sugar readings in real time or to integrate readings from glucose monitors on here. Given how tied to diet and macro nutrients diabetes is, you would think this would've been a basic aspect of the app already - or an add-on that could pop up along with adding food or exercise. 

I've been a MyFitnessPal member for years and do appreciate the detail, massive database, and ability to input your own recipes you get for free. The meal time stamps it already offers with Premium would be really useful for tracking blood sugar, but nope, the only way to track that is manually adding a bunch of blood sugar categories, and then tracking them under progress, like it's your weight. This is useless when you have to do it 4 times a day or more at different times, and you can't look back at sugar levels as part of your diary (linked to your diet). Do the manufacturers just assume that people interested in fitness and diabetics are mutually exclusive populations? 

We need either a setting to add our readings with a timestamp, similar to foods, that then can be read as part of the diary; or integration with the most popular glucometer apps. This should be a basic feature, or at least Premium, for a so-called leading health app.I started using this app February 2022 and I absolutely loved it ! I wasn’t interested in any of the paid features and wouldn’t have really used them, not to mention I couldn’t really afford it, so I stuck to the free version and it worked great for me. I lost 30+ lbs from February - August of this year using the app to track my calories and protein. I chose to continue to use the app even after I reached my weight loss goals to maintain my weight and track my progress photos since I often lift weights. I am extremely disappointed to find that they took away the barcode scanner for tracking food from the free version and moved it to the paid version of the app. I used that feature DAILY to track my meals and now I either have to deal with the inconvenience or stop using the app altogether, since I refuse to pay $20/ month to simply be able to scan my barcodes. This was a key feature in my success with this app because I could quickly track my meals when I was working / busy/ etc. If there was even a smaller one time fee to get this one feature back , I would gladly pay it. I will not pay a $20 subscription fee for this. It took away the convenience and ease of use for me and I think it might be time to move on to a different app.I gave it two stars because I wanted to at least acknowledge what I did like about the application. The only thing I like is the integration with Garmin.

Now to the frustrating part. The purpose of checking this application out and going premium was because the previous app I could only set macros one day at a time. Carb cycling and adjusting daily i was looking for an easier way to set it and forget it.  I went in and customized the daily macro goals for each day of the week and thought this is exactly what I wanted. The next day I look at my dashboard on the app and it has some crazy numbers that were not part of the baseline goal or adjusted goals for the different carb days. The dashboard on the actual website itself in the summary mirrors those crazy macro numbers but when I go to the goals they are all set and reflect the intended goal. Today alone, without me adjusting the dashboard has changed numbers 3 times. 

I tried to take the easy route away from a dependable app that I had to adjust once daily to now paying way more money for an application that is pulling numbers from who knows where. The most recent adjustment has me eating 4707 calories when in the goals it reflects 2568.  Worst decision made at this point in terms of tracking apps.I’ve used this app for many years, my login streak was 2544 days. Back when it was owned by Under Armour it was a great tool for working on one’s health and fitness goals. They added premium features, which I think is great. If someone wants those added tools, it’s awesome to have them available for a small fee. Then came the ads. More started popping up in the app. Banner ads at first, then I was getting a full screen ad after almost everything I did. I get it, it’s a free app. But that’s what premium subscriptions are for. But while the ads got very annoying, they were tolerable. However, then they removed the barcode scanner and put it behind the paywall. This had been a free feature for years, and a feature other apps offer for free. I don’t have long lunch breaks, so scanning barcode made it easy for me to track my intake. Searching through lists of entries for the right one made tracking much more tedious. As much as I loved the app and was faithful for so many years, even urging friends and coworkers to use it, I’m now testing other apps. They took a once great tool and made it tedious to use unless you can afford to be a paid member. Eating healthy is already pricey enough, without adding an extra monthly fee just to track it.I suspect that the premium version, at the premium price, is as good as the free app used to be, but rather than adding specialty features for prime members, they’ve just been subtracting features from the free version. First it was the barcode scanning and some nutrition tracking, and now it doesn’t even offer a view of the macronutrients anymore, so what’s left is a very basic calorie counter without macros, while still making you watch ads and have the premium version pushed on you. 

I hate getting to the point of loving an app until they remove features to the point where you need to go searching for another app that can offer a basic level of tracking. This was one of those apps that I could’ve lived with permanently, trusting them with my data and being ok with watching their adds and buying things from their links, but it just doesn’t make sense anymore. I need to at least be able to track carbs and protein, and there’s little point in going through the trouble of entering my data if all you get is a calorie count. Sadly, it’s time to take a look at what other apps are offering nowadays. 

But I’m sure it’s a great app for those who can afford to pay.I diligently track my macros everyday (which is why I have subscribed to the premium version of this app), and I’ve recently decided (with the guidance of my nutritionist) to change the amount of protein, carbs, and fat I have. When I make these changes, the app auto-adjusts the total of amount of calories that I “should” have daily. But listen here - no one asked for this! I certainly didn’t!!! I should be able to say how many calories, and how many grams of protein/fat/carbs I want without the app stopping me from doing both. As it stands now, I can only do one or the other, which makes no sense. I get that MFP most likely has medical professionals on their team helping to create the suggested macro/calorie breakdowns; but again - I’m not looking for this one-size-fits-all mess. I’m on a serious weight loss journey (down 138lbs, with 60lbs+ left to drop), and I’ve got goals to meet. Please consider disabling this unnecessary function. If I’m paying $50 a year, this entire setup should be customizable. I’d rather not use a different app, because y’all have the best bank of foods to log for tracking, but I’m not planning to continue paying for something that doesn’t meet my needs.I had MyFitnessPal a long time ago on my phone and used it frequently until I lost interest in keeping track of my weight. I decided to download it again recently because I’ve been wanting to keep track of my calories/macros but it is just not the same as it used to be.

I used to be able to keep track of my macros on this app but now they want us to buy a “premium subscription” in order to do that even though there are tons of ad pop-ups already. So now the only thing the app tracks is steps, calories, and reported weight loss/gain. I mean I might as well just track that stuff on my own and not use an app at all. And every time I open the app they ask me to buy their premium subscription which I clearly don’t want nor can afford, and it’s so annoying.

This app has also turned into more of a social media site since the last time I used it. There are blog posts and profiles, and other stuff that just doesn’t make sense for a diet/fitness tracking app. I am honestly quite disappointed by how much the app has changed and I’m thinking I might just delete it soon.So many of us already despise the tediousness of tracking macros, water, exercise, etc. There are few worse feelings than cooking a meal and spending the first five minutes weighting it out and sticking my phone in my face. Likewise, when I get done with a workout, I lay on the floor and try to recover. 

I used to be able to enter my food and water quickly and this app was ALMOST intuitive. I still don’t understand why some foods pop up in my search because I’ve eaten them so often and others don’t. Now I have to click/tap multiple times to find things and NONE of it is intuitive. My request would be to put all trackable data on one page so I don’t have to click/tap so much. I almost gave up on finding the water intake yesterday and starting tracking my weight again this morning, only to find that it is buried in a tab. 

I understand the more they can make you tap around, the more ads they can serve you but this is ridiculous. If it wasn’t for the fact that every trainer and nutritionist on the planet uses this app, I’d find something better.This used to be my go-to app when it came to tracking my calories. I stopped using it for a while but just now came back, only to discover that they had completely changed the app--and not for the better. Not only did I find the overall UI to be less user-friendly, they have removed many abilities for free users. You have to pay to use the barcode scanner now? Come on. I'm following what the other reviews are saying and finding another app.

Edit: To the developers: don't bother using copy and paste responses to reviews when nearly every recent review that I have read has been the same complaint, and you still refuse to make any changes. It's a waste of your time, it's a waste of our time. Everyone has the same concern--putting simple features behind a pay wall--that you are refusing to address. I literally found another app within two seconds of searching on the App Store that does everything I needed to without having to pay a ridiculous subscription.First, don’t sign up with an AppleID. If you do, you won’t be able to login on their website because for some reason they completely forgot to add an option to login using an AppleID as they allow on their app. I can’t believe they missed the mark on that. I also could not get the app ti sync with my Health or Fitness tracking with my iPhone (that synch with my Apple Watch) even when o tried to sync manually it still didn’t work. I truly hope they don’t try to charge me after one month because I signed up with my Apple account. Some apps are tricky like that. Basically I don’t want something that can’t work out of the box and simple things are missed line login options. Plus, what’s the point of data doesn’t sync? But most importantly I can’t even get support unless I “sign up” and I did with my Apple ID. Tried to login with those credentials and it didn’t work. Last thing I want to do is confuse the situation even more if I sign up for an account . This is nerve racking!Only giving this app 2 stars because it’s a great, accurate tool for tracking my calories and macros. I have been using MFP as my primary food-tracker for the past 3+ years, since it offers a thorough breakdown of macros and micronutrients, and the widest selection of foods available for calorie counting. So a plus on that. 

What makes this app such a low rating for me is how PAINFULLY SLOW it is. It wasn’t this slow when I first downloaded the app, but over the past 2 years it has just gotten slower. It takes forever just to get past the blue loading screen, then even longer to load search results and log foods that I’m tracking. Sometimes it will log the same food twice, because why the hell not. Already wasting 5 minutes to perform a simple function, might as well double my calories while you’re at it.

The “performance issues” you guys claim to fix in each update have done NOTHING to fix this. I’ve tried deleting & re-installing the app, nothing. MFP team, FIX THIS!!! I don’t know how much longer I can take of this aggravation.It was a great app for a long while. I loved it and it really helped me. Then it started having issues syncing with FitBit. For months now they have been saying they are working on the problem. I have read comments from other people in their support section with the same issue. I have followed MFP’s suggestions on how to try to fix on the users end. It did not work and it seems MFP is not fixing on their end. I know something as small as a syncing issue to your exercise device may seem like not a good reason to drop the app, but seeing the fitness information really helped keep me motivated. I can use the FitBit app for all of this, but because I was a long time user of MFP it had so much set up for me that I did not want to restart somewhere else. I am sorry that I have to go elsewhere for my tracking needs. For a free app, it was good for a long time. I think, and this is just my opinion, that if you buy the upgraded version everything will miraculously work again. I will just tryout another free app and hope MFP corrects the problem.The app can be very beneficial for tracking food calories and recipes. But some basic functionality that seems so obvious doesn’t exist and makes using the app very inefficient and frustrating. For example, you can create your own recipes which makes it easy for tracking meal prep. However, you cannot copy/duplicate a recipe if you want to make a variation. For example if you make certain types of salad but maybe the ingredients slightly change or maybe the dressing slightly changes, you just can’t create variations of that. You literally have to go back and create a new recipe and manually enter all of the ingredients.  You can’t just duplicate a similar recipe and then add/remove one or two ingredients. You must build it all over again. What makes it worse is the ingredients that you scan then to create other recipes don’t show up in a recent search so you literally have to grab all the ingredients and scan them over again.  Very poor user experience.Unfortunately if you want to use the free version, it’s a terrible app. It’s not just all the ads, which are unusually obnoxious. The app itself is always doing pop up teasers encouraging you to upgrade for this or that feature every time you click to use any free feature. I can’t stand it, it’s super annoying. It would make more marketing sense to at least let the user have some uninterrupted ability to just use the app and see how useful/enjoyable it is. Then if the user is unobtrusively offered opportunities to upgrade, they’re far more likely to do so. But why would I pay to upgrade, when the free version is so irritatingly focused on up selling that I can’t even evaluate its functionality? I definitely will NOT pay for an upgrade, and will just go back to the other tracking app I was using. I thought I’d try the free version of MFP to see if it’s worth the switch, but the app makes it impossible to make that call.I have always used the free version of this app and I lost 14 pounds by tracking my food and activity level. They were always ads, but they were manageable. However, with the upated version, the ads are everywhere and cluttering up the interface way too much. Also, if you’re using the free version you are no longer able to use the scan feature on the barcode of food! They’ve taken away a very popular feature from those of us who use it for “free”, even though it seems we are now subject to far more advertising than we used to be. I think the idea is that if you take away free functionality people will eventually break down and by the premium service. However, I think that is being very shortsighted, and not appreciative of a large group of people who use the app. It’s just annoying and eventually I will probably look for a different app to use.Just like everyone else in the comments I too was upset about the fact that the barcode scanner was set for premium users only. Aside from the whole switcharoo they did with, arguably, the app’s best feature, the app was really good to me for the past almost 6 months that I used it. It made tracking my calories super easy and convenient. Until one of the most recent updates that took the scanning away. Thank you to the developers for the amount of time I spent tracking on this app. Deleting ✌🏽

Edit in response to the developers reply; More of a copy-paste than a genuine reply but regardless of that, the team fails to acknowledge why this app was great. Sure I can “go to my history of logged items” but that’s not the point lol people were more than happy to use the scanner anytime they’d like, regardless of wether the scan was saved already or not. We can also look up items but it’s not as convenient as straight up scanning.MyFitnessPal has now become MyFitnessFoe. This app was exceptional for tracking calories and essentially keeping yourself in check by letting you know what you’re actually putting into your body. As far the calorie breakdown, this app is top of the line in terms of letting me know an approximate estimation on the macros I consume each day. However, that paywall they put for scanning barcodes, along with a plethora of things that were once free before is the start of the downfall of this app. I’m okay with the ads that come up on the bottom of the app, I’m sure many are as opposed to paying monthly. Think about it, you’re basically paying RENT to keep track of YOUR health. It’s ludicrous actually. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. You guys are better than this. I don’t care if you need to cover your “operational needs.” What made this app unique is now gone and now you’re no better than the average fitness app. Do better guys. Thank you! AnshilI used this app for many years to successfully support me on my weight loss journey (lost ~90 pounds in 2 years). Recently I decided to redownload it again to help me track my macros and keep my weight where I want it. I noticed the UI changes, but didn’t think much of it, the UI had never been the most intuitive anyway. 
However, I was very disappointed to discover that tracking macros was now considered a premium feature, whereas before it was part of the app’s free functionality. 
I understand why they would do this, but I just want MFP to know - there are much better premium alternatives out here than the premium version of your app. People (like me) use your app BECAUSE it was by far the best non-paying app that did what it did. Making a vital function like macro tracking a premium feature isn’t going to convince people to pay you, it’s going convince people (like me) to take their business elsewhere.This app is honestly extremely disappointing for how ubiquitous it is. It’s the only food tracking app that integrates with some of my smart devices, yet I end up uninstalling it because it’s just annoying to use. 

The database is actually NOT that comprehensive. I end up going back to Baritastic because almost everything I eat is either not in the database, or I can’t edit the serving size. I don’t have time to be constantly entering my nutrition data. 

It’s also extremely annoying to not be able to turn off the feature where my exercise or move calories are subtracted from my intake calories. I don’t need that information and it would be far more useful to me as an app if I could turn it off. 

The notifications, even when fully customized, are far too frequent and annoying. I end up getting notification fatigue. And I understand the need for ads, but they get in the way of using the app efficiently. There is absolutely nothing that is enticing me to actually subscribe to get rid of ads, because it just doesn’t hit any of my other needs. 

Despite how clunky Baritastic looks, I keep uninstalling myfitnesspal and going back to Baritastic because at least it functions and the database has more foods. You really need to fix the free version enough before I would ever be motivated to pay for the premium.I have been using MyFitnessPal for several years. It’s been a pretty good app, and until recently the updates kept making it better.

It has been easy to create recipes and meals you make at home and eat on a regular basis. It remembers foods you eat regularly and suggests them to you to enter in the  diary. The best thing for diary entries is being able to see a list of foods you commonly eat at a specific meal and tick off boxes to log common foods quickly with one tap.

Until recently, the interface felt sleek, with all the most common tools right up front where they are easily used every day.

However, the most recent update has changed the diary interface; it feels like it has gone backwards at least five years. Once you get around the much clunkier interface, it doesn’t take long to discover that the developers have removed the simple diary entry for weight tracking, which is likely the main reason the vast majority of people use apps like this. If you want to log your weight it’s now hidden inside the “Goals” menu. It feels like you’re changing your profile when you update your weight, not simply logging a number anymore. It’s hard to find, and a really weird choice.

I’ve been a regular user for a long time, but the newest updates have me looking for a new food diary app.Up until yesterday, I could build my routines on the free version of the app and see what the estimated time, calories burned and total weight load was for the workouts I’ve built.  Today, all of that detail is no longer available.  I’ve used MFP for years, the free and paid versions, and this feature was always available.  Today it looks like they’ve taken this feature away from the free version.  So disappointed and will no longer use this app to track my workouts.

I left two stars for the calorie counting feature of this app.  When I did use the paid version, it was great for tracking my macros.  Today, I’ve learned what works for me Food wise so I I no longer need this feature but continued to use it for the workout functions.  Since this part of the app has changed, I no longer find the app useful for my purposes.I’ve used my fitness pal for years (I think on and off for about 7 total). It’s always had some bugs (randomly quitting, error loading/syncing data, etc.) but I didn’t use premium so I dealt with it just fine. Recently I reactivated the app after not using it for about a month. Upon every single time I opened the app, it would say, “welcome back, please enter your goals” and I’d have to manually re-enter my calories, body metrics, etc goals. Then I’d have to go into my preferences and adjust my general macronutrient preferences. Every single time I opened the app, which was usually about 3x a day (3 meals and then however many snacks I’d have or water input). Seemed like an intentionally obnoxious way to prompt users to pay for premium, which is a great way to get rid of longtime users who have just liked to use it for general dietary tracking for health (I have autoimmune diseases and need the logs for my doctor). What a bummer! Oh well.I’ve been using another fitness app for the past 10 years or so but that has gotten ridiculously buggy, so I decided to try this one...but I think I’d rather go back to the bugs. This app looks like it can do a lot but perhaps it has bitten off more than it can chew because screens load PAINFULLY slowly. Getting the tracking data from my Apple Watch into this app was difficult - I tried a couple things before it worked, it certainly wasn’t intuitive. And it will let me set a daily step goal, but it won’t count the calories I burned taking those steps toward the calories I eat - only calories that I have burned exercising. But the pièce de résistance this morning is that I could not after 45 minutes of searching find a way to input my weight. I’m sure there is a way, I made it asked me for my weight when I first signed up yesterday, but it’s definitely not going to be into whatever easy so I’m done.I really hate multiple things about this app but have scoured the web for a better one. No such luck. I haven’t used MFP in a few years, when I decided to use it again, I found out that they now charge for everything. Ridiculous. But whatever, I ignore all the annoying ads. When I first synced the Apple health app to MFP, it put everything except my water intake in. The next day, it stopped syncing properly. The health app showed all the food I ate, but MFP was not importing the information about my workout or water intake at all. I reached out to customer service a week ago. Nothing. No reply. Horrible customer service. I love the tracking of my food and the fact that I can import recipes fast and easily, but I wish syncing was corrected. I tried deleting the app and redownloading it, it did nothing.
Also my Hidrate bottle should be syncing with MFP, nope... it doesn’t. So frustrating. I have to put it in manually.I have been using MyFitness Pal for about seven years now and have always been happy with it. Best parts are the app speed and responsiveness and the huge foods database. As a diabetic, I would like to see glucose and insulin tracking, as well as connection to continuous glucose monitors such as Dexcom. Would be nice to have all in one place as some other apps now do. I have considered going with premium on several occasions, however MFP is now the most expensive tracker available now, with less features! You have also moved features that had been free for years, and are common with every other app, such as the scan function, to premium only. Quite frankly, that move by itself made me want to find another app and stop using MFP at all. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. Most likely, I will not be using MFP any longer. Hate to leave, but no longer works for me.Updated review: This truly is the most comprehensive calorie and exercise tracker out there. Unfortunately, MFP knows that now. Now they charge for practically every service. Their customer service is TERRIBLE. I quit using it for a long time and went on a journey to find something comparable, and came up with nothing. So I'm back. I hate using the app. I hate all the ads disguised as blog posts on the home page. 

In short, MFP is the worst user experience, but best database for calorie tracking.

Original review: I've tried almost every weight loss app out there. This is by far the best! Any time you don't have Internet you can save local changes. I got this app march 29 and by April 1st I had already lost two pounds! Plus having friends encourages you to track more! The only change I would add is the ability to do a before and after photo. But, that would just be something extra not necessary at all.I’ve been using this app for a few months and it was fine initially. I loved setting food based goals in order to meet my weight goals and the ease of using the app track that. Tracking workouts was also nice despite the fact that the app doesn’t calculate calories burned from anything other than cardio so you have to rely on a fitness watch or another app for logging strength training accurately. There were premium features as to be expected from most apps now and I was fine without those. Taking a pic of a meal and logging it that way was premium,for example. Now you also need premium to simply scan a  barcode and log food items or you have to search and enter them manually which you didn’t have to do the last time I was on the app. It is now virtually useless to me and has been deleted. Capitalism strikes again.This app was my go-to for calorie tracking on my fitness journey. Extremely easy to use and follow. They recently decided to trap their barcode scan feature behind a pay wall. Can you get around this via the search feature? YEP! Is it stupid, also YEP!

Now, I’m no stranger to having to pay for premium features, I don’t mind doing it. But, the barcode scanner isn’t worth the $20 per month being charged. I have no use for anything else under the premium cost especially considering they made no improvements to the existing feature trapped behind the pay wall. It seems the owners were aware of users enjoying the barcode scanner so they decided to trap the most utilized free feature behind a pay wall.

 If it were nearer to the $5 mark, I’d consider it but where it stands currently, I’ll just switch back to the search feature.I really would like to give this app 5 stars.  I’ve used it for a few years in and off. I lost about 12 pounds tracking calories on here. I am now trying Keto (1 week in) and I love the macros break down. I have noticed from when I first started using it with my Apple Watch, sometimes my workouts don’t sync; I’d say at least 45% of the time I have to figure out how to enter it manually. The next thing I have problems with is adding and editing recipes. I go through and scan every single ingredient, “save and log it,” and it won’t save or log! Becomes agitating to scan all ingredients in sometimes 3 times to get it to save. Same with editing. I added a tablespoon of something, when it should have only been a teaspoon, and that mistake cost me so much time trying to edit it. So, I am definitely using this more than ever, but I wish it could improve these areas.Great app but not sure it’s working correctly. I have an iPhone and an Apple Watch and everything goes to the health app but wasn’t tracking things correctly my watch and health app would log say 8,000 steps but only show 5,000 on this app even after hitting the sync. So I also downloaded the UA record app now everything reads the same for steps and exercise time but it’s now giving me the negative calorie adjustment which I would think would add to my total calories for the day instead of subtract those from my daily goal. So my calorie goal is 1660 which usually I stay under that but once it subtracts my steps then it puts me over my calorie goal? None of the apps seems to work great together and I had better tracking when I just used my phone with only the MyFitnessPal app. Something doesn’t seem right with everything together. Please fix or help me figure this outI’ve used this app religiously a few years back. It was pretty decent..at least the best one for keeping track of food as well as macro counting. Sounds silly but keeping up with my long streak was way too much..if I forgot or the app wasn’t working..losing your years long streak was too much. I disliked the anxiety over it.

I’ve redownloaded the app. After issues scanning something it doesn’t show up at all to add to what I’ve eaten. The calories I had didn’t match up right. I had to get a pen and paper out calculate everything. The app claims I had 500 calories more then what I really did. (Keep in mind the app was missing my dinner. In my own calculations I included it)

A once great and free app has now put too much focus on premium..you cannot do much of anything without spending money. Wanting people to join and use your app to get people healthy should be your number one priority. Not frustrate them or force them to pay. There are too many people out here with different dietary needs to have such a huge limit. 

Focus more on wanting folks healthy (especially in the US) and less about how much you make. Trust me having people liking your app and getting healthier will feel much better then how much is in your bank account.I downloaded this app when I was 14 because I hated myself and wanted to look more like the other kids my age. I’m 19 now and have been logging on and off with this app for years. My best streak of logging was for 2 years. Your body is not meant to be in a calorie deficit for 2 years. My hair started falling out, I looked pale and gaunt. I’ve tried to stop logging and i can’t. I’m addicted. Food is just a number to me now. I can’t go out to eat, I can’t enjoy a night out without having a panic attack and trying to calculate what was in my meal. Obviously this is not the fault of the app itself but the idea of counting calories will stop you from following your natural hunger cues and give you a lifelong history of disordered eating. I wish I could go back and time and never start tracking my foodI started using this app to count carbs for my insulin dosing (Type 1 diabetic). It’s been really useful for that, and it helped me lose 25 pounds and keep it off for 3 years so far. I’ve recommended it to dozens of other diabetics. Unfortunately, I received an email from My Fitness Pal today saying that the barcode scan function that used to be free, and was one of the biggest reasons I chose this app for carb counting, is moving to Premium subscription only. It’s really important that I record exactly the right product because it affects my medication dosing and wrong carb values can be dangerous for me! I already pay through my nose for insulin and other diabetes care - there’s not space in my budget to also pay such a high price for a service that used to be free. Seriously considering switching to a different food tracking app.I’ve been a user of this app for a long time and I even subscribed to their premium option for an entire year and loved it. I mainly use it now for simply tracking calories and tryingggg to create recipes and figuring out the calories in said recipes. The create recipes option NEVER syncs with the server. EVER. It does save it. SOMETIMES. However the option to save and log simultaneously NEVER works for me. Sometimes the app will close and just kick me out. This all started happening after I cancelled my premium subscription a few months ago because before that I don’t remember having these issues. I deleted it and tried downloading it again to see if that solved anything but it won’t even let me log back in or change my password. I am trying a different calorie tracking app. Sad because I’ve been using this one for years.Ads never fail to display. Movement and workout data that have already synced to my iPhone from my Watch frequently seem to disappear when I open the MFP app during the day. Having to force quit, then re-select the Watch as the data source wastes time, swipes, and is a very frustrating ritual.

I have noticed a major uptick in server communication problems in recent weeks. This has prevented me from adding or updating recipes, as well as searching for food and drink items in the database. As a result, my tracking has become more of a chore than a quick habit, and I’m not sure it’s as accurate since I’m not entering items in the moment. Not good. 

I was considering purchasing a premium subscription since I do use the app every day, but I think I need to pay for a more reliable app instead. It’s too bad. What’s here had potential.In the past decade I’ve personally used MFP to drop over 30 pounds and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 5 years ago, I told everyone I knew about it and couldn’t have said enough good things. 

In the past 2 years since the UnderArmor sale this app has deteriorated so much that I am actively considering other options despite having 10 years of data in the app. I could write a laundry list of feedback, but most importantly: bugs are now the norm, especially in the recipe storage/creation, exercise calorie logging and progress tracking. And the ads are too many in number, disruptive to efficient usage of the app and genuinely disturbing sometimes in terms of content. 

I’m so sad to say this but if I was a new calorie counter looking for an app, I’d probably shop around before settling for this.I’ve used the free version of this app sporadically for a few years, and overall enjoyed it. One of my favorite features was the ability to scan barcodes. So fast and easy. When I came back to the app this time around, I was seriously considering upgrading to the premium, because I want to be serious this time. But I decided to used it for free for a few weeks first to make sure I was really going to use it. I used it for a day or two, but then upgraded to the latest version ….. and now the barcode scan is a premium feature! You’ve got to be kidding me. That totally turns me off on paying. Getting people hooked on an awesome feature and then ripping it out from under them unless they pay for it? Not my favorite business model. I’ll be shopping for a different tracking app.New year, new us - husband and I decided to start tracking our calorie intake again. However, we realized the the option to share foods via iMessage had been removed in late 2020. Why on earth would you remove an excellent feature?? We were THRILLED that sharing was an option when we switched to iPhones. Now I am extremely disappointed that it has been taken away. The in-app option of finding your friends, looking at their diary, and copying to your own diary takes way too many steps. The ONLY reason I am still using MFP is because it’s the only food diary app that links with Garmin. But don’t worry - I am actively looking for an alternative option even if it requires doing some additional work. PLEASE BRING THE SHARING FEATURE BACK!!!!!!I had recently had some issues where I was overusing data on my family’s share plan (like 40% of our 20gb plan with 4 family members). At the start of the month I reset my iPhone’s data tracker to see which apps were the worst offenders. To my surprise MyFitnessPal was at the top of the list after 3 days. This was really surprising/frustrating because I had not even been using the app!! I’m not even going to think too much about what data MyFitnessPal may be downloading/uploading, but I imagine this will concern others. 

I like the app and have used this app on and off for years, but this is unacceptable. I will be deleting the app off my phone. Perhaps I will download it again in a few months to check for improvements. MyFitnessPal please fix this so I can keep using my favorite calorie tracking app. 

ZackI used My fitness pal quite a while ago, I even went premium for a year and during that time I loved it. Even as a free user logging was easy so I was motivated to go premium. It was the ease of scanning with the data that got additional results. 

 Then they took away barcode scanning. They left the icon of course so as you keep trying to scan in it reminds you to “Go premium” with all going on in the world it’s hard to just drop $80 to just scan in barcodes.  A tiered system might be good but they are going for maximum cash grab… I don’t need the whole picture I just need calories tracked quickly. All these extra steps turn people off to the idea of tracking so people who need to get in shape are priced out or extra stepped out. Not a fan, they had value, lost value… mehI pay for the premium version of this app. It’s supposed to make my life tracking calories and nutrition easier, but it doesn’t. I’ve wasted so much time with this app. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spent 20+ minutes creating a meal only for it not to show up after I save it. I constantly receive notifications that I haven’t logged meals when I have. I don’t have the option to add items, so I have to rely on the inadequate option of “Quick Add”, which doesn’t take several important nutritional details into account (SODIUM!). Item data is frequently incorrect. What’s the point of scanning a barcode if serving and nutritional values are incorrect? The devs need to do a much better job with QA. In the meantime, I’m going to look for a more reliable app.Used this app for years to track calories, but the last 6 months I’ve only used it to track weight and visualize a graph of loss. It’s now significantly more steps to do this :‎/ instead of going to a progress page where I can see my weight I have to click my account, click on the weight I’ve lost, which defaults to a count of how many steps I’ve done, change that to see progress of weight instead, enter a new weight, and then it immediately goes back to the homepage instead of staying on the weight page. I have to go through the multi-step process twice to log and then see my weight progression and it’s really annoying. I’m considering switching apps or just tracking it in excel instead or something because of this.Edit: just received an email today saying they are removing the barcode scanning function for everyone except premium paid members. What a load of crap! You guys aren’t here to help people with their health it’s 100% a money grab! You guys should be ashamed! 

I loved using this app before and it really helped me get more active and what h what I’m eating and loose 50lbs. After they updated the homepage it’s so confusing! They made it way less streamlined, everything is disorganized and there’s so many ads blocking between. It’s also not tracking my exercise/steps accurately and a lot of the time when I scan a barcode of a name brand food it says they can’t find it and it doesn’t exist. Kraft mayo isn’t in your system?? Dumb- whoever redesigned this needs a demotion!This is the first app that I’ve used that gets worse over time.  It’s not a bad app for tracking…but what possible reason could they have for taking away the ability to share foods? I used to text my wife the foods that I was logging…not anymore.  If it’s still there, then it’s definitely not intuitive.  Now, every time you log something, you have to do an extra step to get back to your total macros…so to see the “damage done” there’s an extra step.  When logging all your food for the whole day that’s a huge amount of time.  Change it back to where it was three or four years ago, then stop messing with it.  Haven’t really looked for alternative apps yet, but I’m going to start.The phone app is great and fine. 

But I need to be able to sit down at my desk and review and refine things on the food diary on my computer at the end of the day. The website does not account for net carbs, recipe creator doesn’t let you delete ingredients if you make a mistake(and won’t let you use the same recipe name when you have to clear and start over), and the vast majority of foods that are in the data base are just plain incorrectly recorded. Monk fruit ITR does not have 4 carbs per serving. The website is such a huge pain and awful to use. It doesn’t correlate or communicate well with the phone app. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF WEIGHT LOSS, make the website as good as the phone app!! At least give me net carb tracking! I’d be fine with just that! 🥲I used MyFitnessPal years ago, before Under Armor bought (and apparently now sold) it, to lose a good 50 pounds partially by tracking food. The app was a very useful part of that journey, and once I reached the destination I no longer needed the app and stopped using it.

Fast forward to now, some 7 years later where I’m mostly looking to track macronutrients, I downloaded the app again. Sadly, the app has been so overloaded with ads, popups, and restrictions that it is incredibly difficult to use even the most basic features.

Immediately I took to the internet to see if better options exist (they usually do) and found Cronometer which offers a much more usable experience upon my early assessment. 15 minutes in and I’ve uninstalled MyFitnessPal and deleted my account, mostly since I have no idea who owns it now.

At the end of the day any tools to help you be healthy are good tools—but the easier and less restrictive they are to use, the more likely we are to use them. Sadly, MyFitnessPal has regressed into something that distracts from the real goals of good nutrition, fitness, and overall health.I’ve been using this app for years and it was great for tracking your calories your nutrition and your fitness progress, but features slowly started becoming premium only which is understandable, the more popular the app gets the more money the developers would want, but once they took away barcode scan, which was easily my #1 most used feature over all these years, I just don’t have any reason to continue using the app. I won’t say 1 star because before all this, the app definitely did help me and I still recommend for people who are willing to work around not scanning barcodes, but I’m very precise when it comes to what I’m loggingI hadn’t yet checked MyFitnessPal’s data collection information, so when considering adding my Apple Watch to track my steps, and being prompted to allow access to my Health data, I thought I should check. On the bright side, diagnostic information is not linked to the user. Unfortunately, other things like My Health are. And identifier information is even used for tracking. Given that I purchased the Apple Watch, because 1) have an iPhone but also 2) because something like Fitbit is now owned by Google who has very sketchy data privacy practices, it’s not too difficult for me to say goodbye to MFP. Regardless of whether the newest update fixes the recent UI issues.I’ve used this app on and off for years and I’ve always loved it. It’s got a user-friendly interface and a lot of helpful features in the free version. Recently, the barcode scanner feature has been taken off the free version—now you can only access it if you want to pay $20/mo or $80+/yr for the paid version. I used the barcode feature pretty much every day, so it is incredibly frustrating that they felt the need to do this. Not to mention, the paid version has very little else to offer, so I would only be buying it to get the scanner back, and I’m certainly not going to do that. So goodbye for now, MFP. I’ll be switching to a different tracking app ✌️I’ve been using the app since 2018. Really made logging my food and tracking my macros easier because I could literally just scan any barcode and it would pull up the nutrition information for it. Now you have to pay to use the barcode scanner? I got over the annoying ads that are now on the app that used to not take up your entire screen but now you don’t get to use the barcode scanner unless you pay for a subscription. Really sucked to see that this app is turning into every other fitness app out there that just cares about making money. Charging for something that’s been free for over five years? C’mon, what is wrong with y’all?For the most part, the app is great. Nutrition & hydration tracking, the blog posts, etc.  But on the technical side, it’s very glitchy. It won’t save the meal times the first (or second, or sometimes even third) time I select them, it sometimes spazzes when I go to copy-paste a log from one day to the next, and it creates duplicates of foods in my log on a given day, forcing me to constantly have to delete things. If they could improve the technical stuff, this app would be perfect. 

P.S. I know about force closing and deleting/reinstalling the app; but I’ve tried those things, and the problems have persisted, and actually gotten worse over time.I’ll start with how this app is decent when it comes to tracking calories in what you eat and even making sure you reach your goal for the day. But I can’t get over how annoying adding stuff to my own meals is. I would be adding ingredients to a meal, scan a barcode, then attempt to add that food and my meal gets deleted. No trace of it, previous entered ingredients are gone, why?? Not to mention most common food items found in stores like Campbells soup and Croutons are food using a barcode. Either way, decent app for tracking, not bashing that, but some functionality in adding foods could be made a lot easier. Imma look for a new app to do this in the meantime.Wish I could rate this app at 5 stars. Let me start by saying I Love this app. It has helped me tremendously in tracking what I eat and also losing & maintaining my weight. Just recently it has logged me out and will not let me log back in! Upon my several attempts to log back in, it said that either my email address is incorrect or my password is incorrect... both of which I made sure WERE correct. Upon my additional attempts to log back in, it said that it’s unable to connect to the server... this has gone on now for almost two days.
Again, I used to be a big fan of this app, but I’m installing it and finding another fitness tracker... I may check back later with this app or maybe notI’ve been using this app since about 2016. I haven’t used it much this year, but decided to start again. I can no longer scan barcodes without paying $20 a month?!? That’s ridiculous! And it doesn’t appear to be making recommendations anymore. Previously,  if you were logging an item it would suggest other foods you commonly eat with it, so you could quickly add them at the same time. I’ve always done the free version, so I was used to ads, but they’re obnoxious now. In between every single thing you do in the app an add will pop up. I’ll be looking for a new app to use for calorie tracking. This one is absolute trash now.When it decides to sync properly it’s a wonderful app for tracking activity and calories, probably the best. But, it often times does not work for no apparent reason.  It will sync fine for days on end then suddenly it simply won’t sync. Reset your phone, disable then reenable sharing from the health app. Swipe down from the newsfeed to refresh. Even reinstall the app. You name it I have tried it and while most tricks work some of the time, nothing ever works consistently every time. It is beyond frustrating. If the app doesn’t sync there is no reason to put up with all the other ads and upselling, there are other calorie trackers.I was an avid MFP user because it was user friendly. I loved being able to scan in foods to make tracking quick, easy, and effortless. Now, they’ve decided to put a price on using the scan feature (that us users have contributed to). I have no issues paying for an app, but not at the expense of my and countless others hard work to create the database in the first place. Typical corporate American, making money off of other people’s work. I don’t think MFP prices are worth it when apps like Lose Ot offer lifetime memberships for the same amount of a year with MFP.

I’m not paying for features I neither want nor need just to use the barcode scanner. I found it useful but not that useful. Further, although I like the app, it hasn’t bought my loyalty. I will happily return to the FitBit app to continue my tracking should additional features suddenly end up behind an overpriced paywall. It’s an okay app, but not exceptional enough to fork out an ongoing fee. If they want to encourage premium membership, make it worth it. That includes accurate food entries. Too many, including those accessed by barcode, are wrong or outdated. They can’t be trusted. Better syncing with the various trackers and their apps. Although syncing has been more reliable with my Apple Watch than FitBit, it still has its idiosyncrasies. And have the keyboard stop minimizing in the middle of entering a recipe — EVERY SINGLE TIME. And should the keyboard disappear from view while I have my finger on the delete key, I lose the recipe. It’s annoying. Oh, and my entered Foods and Recipes disappear from the app. I know I entered them, but they’re nowhere to be found for selection. I can’t even search them on the MyFitnessPal website. I’m not paying extra for something that hasn’t proven itself entirely reliable.I’ve had this app for a few years now and have had success losing weight while tracking my food intake. Recently there was a change to the layout of the app and how you see your status and how you enter food, exercise, weight, etc. I do not like this change as it has made the app slower, not as “user friendly” or straight forward for entering weight or exercise. I’ve also had issues with it converting my steps into exercise. This has been going on for a couple months. It has no problem being accurate with my steps (just from my iPhone), but it rarely updates the exercise calories to reflect the steps. I know there are millions of options it has to find as far as food entries, but there are times where I scan and item’s barcode and the nutrition information that pops up does not match the nutritional information on the actual item (even if it finds the correct/exact item in the database). Because of this, I do not plan to purchase the premium package. Im worried that I’ll pay for something that I’ll still have to double check and do the math myself. Even though there are some things I get frustrated with about this app, I still recommend it as a tool to lose weight or just monitor your dietary health.This app has been useful for tracking my meals over the last year but there are some issues. The app will read and write the *same* data from Apple Health, screwing up your weight in both apps. I always update my weight in Apple health but when you look at the data in the app it shows the source of the data and after every entry in Apple, there is an  identical entry written by MFP. Sometimes this is a day after another entry and this especially screws up my data. Doesn’t seem there is an easy way to fix and has increasingly become a frustrating problem. 
The good features are the ability to see your data at a glance under the progress tab that is easy to get to and shows progress in weight, steps, and other body measurements. 
I have tried a few other apps that have a much nicer UI (like Senza) but while it looks great, the design is a bit more complicated to use. KetoDiet has much more relevant, diet-inclusive recipes than MFP but it probably would not be as useful to someone on a different diet. 
Overall this is the best app for most people that may be on any number of diets, as you are able to track macros and calories (even from many restaurants) quickly and add workouts. Those are the basics of most body management plans and this app does it best.I’ve used this app for YEARS. It’s always been my go-to for tracking calories. It was made easy especially with the amount of people using it that made the app grow in good ways. Like finding brands easier and foods that were accurate to what was actually listed on the label. Being able to add just calories manually was helpful. And the addition to add a recipe and meals, I’ve spent multiple minutes putting together to help me track my food. Point is, I’ve found many useful features in this app that never made me want to switch over. But one feature I’ve used the MOST was the barcode scanner. I didn’t have to worry about manually putting in the calories. It was a boom and done…. That’s until they’ve blocked it with a paywall. I understand that these companies needs to make money but I cannot afford to purchase this app yearly just for one important feature. It should have been kept free-to-use with ads. So unfortunately, this has caused me to delete the app and look elsewhere. I will no longer be using MFP.This is a useful app for tracking progress. It’s a bit cumbersome on the exercise and Food/intake counters because it takes so long to find a matching workout / food. But for a free app - it definitely solves the tracking problem with multiple factors (unlike other free apps ) A bit Annoying that it refuses to reduce calories below 1200 even if you’re a very small , older woman and doesn’t give you the option decide whether or not you want exercise calories to be added to your daily count when you workout. So in the first weeks I was maintaining and started gaining until I realized what was going on. It also didn’t properly integrate with the weight gurus scale and I think it messed up the records because everything was working great before I “integrated” but now the history gets wiped out when I make changes in this app. Ugh! One very valuable feature is the macros calculator and the fact that you can control your percentages for your goals. Overall - a  good app definitely worth trying !So I felt bad as this was the 3rd app I downloaded just trying to track my protein intake only but just like the previous apps they asked for my more information than what was needed. So it frustrated me that this app was no different than the rest though the developer did contact me saying they will talk to the developing team. The problem is with some of these apps is that I find myself spending more time trying to login information then I am actually counting it and working out and eating. Maybe if they had a skip feature so you can just go straight to counting your intake would be very nice. It would definitely would have the advantage over other intake tracking apps. Don’t get me wrong. I think it’s cool they have apps like this to help people out. But for us Gym rats We already know what we need and what we want. it would just be nice to have a quick and easy method to track our progress besides using Apple notes.As a food journal, 5 star app.

But I took away 2 stars for 2 other reasons.  You may not care about these issues.  If you just want to journal, this is the best app.

The app does great with tracking food and finding foods and their nutrients  The best feature is the barcode scanner. If there is a barcode on food you can usually get the nutrients from the barcode. Makes it really easy to log all the specifics.

On the negative side.  How food organized, and how your most recent grades come up, isn’t totally intuitive. additionally, the green badges that indicate trust in food is sometimes not accurate. I’ve looked up nutrients for specific foods and found they don’t match some of the green badged items.   It’s a great idea, but I need a little more QA. That is why I took away one star.

I took away another star, because of the fit bit syncing problem. The worst feature is that the app often won’t sync with a Fitbit. It says it will.  But it won’t.  It’s a glitch in the system.   This has been driving me nuts for the past three days. It is apparently driving many other people nuts as well. Better not to say you have the functionality, then to say you have it and have people spend literally hours disconnecting and reconnecting devices without success.  There are many strings on mine about this problem. I followed many sets of  directions to solve - all to no avail.

Overall, if any of the above were fixed, 5 stars.Useful app for macro tracking but the UX could use some work so as to not be so confusing. When I first updated my macro goals, I went back to the Home Screen and it showed the default ones. I tried again several times but it kept showing the default macro goals on my dashboard. I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to figure it out. There is no confirm button or any feedback to indicate that you’ve updated your goals successfully, so I thought there was just some confirm button that I couldn’t find. There wasn’t, it just takes half an hour to update on the dashboard for some reason. 

This and other similar issues of not enough signifiers or proper feedback make the app confusing to use until you get the hang of it. Now that I know a bit better how it works, it’s nice to have, but I almost gave up before figuring it out due to how painful of a process it was.I’ve used this app on and off again for years. Great database for tracking calories. They made it simple by being able to scan your food using the barcode and it would enter all the nutrition facts and calorie information. This was all included in the free version of the app. But now every time you want to select the barcode it wants you to pay for a subscription. This is frustrating and annoying. Now I understand having to pay a few dollars for an app, or even having to put up with ads, but $20/month to unlock the barcode feature, that is insane. I know it comes with others benefits too, but using the barcode scanner used to be free and now paying $20/month or more seems like theft. I would love to keep using this app, but don’t think I will be in the future unless they decide to revert to a more affordable option.My fuss isn’t with the app itself.  My problem is with the money grab!  You guys have been there thru thick and thin (quite literally) and changes have come and gone. Admittedly, I don’t LOVE change, but you’ve yet to add anything to the free version to make it better. Everything is so blatantly directed at encouraging the premium version and I understand wanting to make more money, especially with todays economy…trust me, I get it. But I hate your angle. Taking things away that have always been free. Might I suggest tiers of membership???  Because your prices are steep!!   And I know you’re the most loved food tracking app and rightly so…just feels crappy the way you’ve gone about it. Anyway. Nothing wrong with the app itself. Works great like it always has. Just feels like a very small version of what our government does…gets you use to something and then charges out the rear for it once you’re hooked.I have found this app useful for the calorie intake and food tracking. I have a few issues however. First, I’m on my feet a lot with my job, but sometimes the movement is back and forth within a few feet area. My steps aren’t counted in the tracker because I haven’t moved far enough, GPS speaking. I realize I could have another tracking device and link them, but it’s really not that important to me. It’s an observation I’ve made. And my second issue is the fact that I can’t seem to delete food from the “recent” list. Sometimes I only eat something once, such as at a restaurant or dinner at a friend’s house. The list is getting annoyingly long. Maybe I just haven’t found out how to delete the foods yet, although, I have tried/looked several times. I’ve only been using this for a month, but it does make you accountable for what goes in your mouth and tracks exercises easily.I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for years, though really began using it well about two years ago. It helped me lose 40 pounds. For the most part, it’s an easy to use app, has a massive database, and tracks things really well.

I haven’t bothered with the nutritional plans. I suppose some people might find it useful, but I have my own nutritional plans built on my own research. Given I used the app for free, I have no issue with ads. I use the app so they should get paid somehow! I didn’t have a problem when the scanner started using ads, too. Makes sense!

Unfortunately, the scanner is now locked behind the paywall. Like I said, I have no need for the nutritional plans, so $20/mo or $80/yr is a crazy amount to pay for just the scanner.

I’d like to request a second tier that is far less expensive giving us access to the scanner, macro tracking, and even no ads. Let the higher price be for those interested in the meal and nutritional plans. I’d be happy to pay for that, something like $5/mo, $25/yr?

But as it is, I’ll have to start looking around elsewhere. I don’t mind paying for a service, especially one I use all the time, but I can’t bring myself to pay that much when 90% of what I’m spending the money on I simply do not use.I have used this app for many years successfully, most recently this past year to lose 47 pounds! This worked because of syncing with my Fitbit and the ease with which I could log food. The recent update that changed the format for logging food is horrible. Not visually intuitive at all, too many clicks, too many opportunities for error. The “multi add” screen worked very well, just check things off on the list and hit enter. Boom, done. The new list with disappearing checkmarks, ridiculous “food logged!” notification takes too much time and double logs entries if you change the portion size.
Also the app no longer syncs with my Fitbit as of two weeks ago. Numerous attempts to remedy this have failed.
If these issues are remedied, it could go back to being an excellent food and exercise tracking app!This used to be the best app for logging nutritional information. However now with over a year of being able to make a convenient, interactive widget to see where we are in the day without having to open the app or to easily add information, they still haven’t added it. I emailed support and they have no plans to do so. They also do not have any Watch complications which blows my mind. Both are absolute basics now. The lack of innovation compared to how much money they make is nothing short of disappointing. I have discovered several newer tracking apps that have all of the features MyFitnessPal does plus innovations for Apple Watch and iOS 14 & 15. Sadly I am moving over to one of them, which also costs about half of the annual cost of MyFitnessPal. I hope in the future MyFitnessPal does better.As you can probably see a lot of the positive reviews are 1+ years old because they had a really good app before, but they slowly started adding things that customers have been using for years behind a pay wall. Some changes were very petty like making so if you wanted to scan your food  in via barcode you have to pay a monthly cost. That’s a simple feature I’ve been using for 6 years and have always enjoyed the app and recommended it to other people. But now the competition has stacked and there’s better apps with better UI and designs that have a simple one time fee versus a monthly one. They’re slowly working themselves away from top contention when it comes to food tracking apps, very disappointing whoever is making the business decisions there now screwed up something greatI’ve used this app for over 6 years and have experienced great successes in weight loss, weight maintenance, and nutrition tracking. I was super disappointed with the new interface. The pop-up ads are not only cheap looking, but also an incredible inconvenience to someone looking to quickly track their food throughout the day. I almost would rather keep a handwritten notebook with calories than pay someone to store how many chicken nuggets I had for lunch while smacking me with an ad for a random yoga app. I could be super wrong, but would assume the majority of users only really care about tracking calories/nutrition and having a huge (user-entered, myself included) database to pull from. Not all the random extras. If people do want that? Let them pay. If not? Let them have a simple, user-friendly app.For one, most of what I scan never comes up and I either have to search or add manually, due to a large database of incorrect macros, measurements or both. 

Another issue I have been having as a premium member is when I’m updating my weight on the web, it continues to readjust my macros. This only happens on the web. I’ve been troubleshooting with MFP and they’re unable to find a solution. It’s quite annoying that I can’t use the web to add my daily weight without having to continually readjust my macros back where they were previously set. 

Outside of that, for tracking purposes this is one of the (few) apps, so most people use it. It’s good to keep track of macros. But it does have a lot of issues and kinks even in 2023. I’ve been using this app since it first launched.I’ve used MFP off and on for 13 years now. It has always been a reliable way to track my macros with low effort. I re-downloaded the app today after not using it for about a year and wow, what a difference. Ads everywhere and a ton of paid functionality cluttering up the interface. The barcode scanner is a paid feature now? Sad face. It’s pretty tragic to see one of my favorite apps of all time fall victim to the profit-seeking game. There was nothing wrong with OG MFP for the average user, all of these additions make it annoying to use. Maybe the creators could launch a free version that goes back to the simpler roots and then keep the paid app for those who want/need the enhanced functionality. I guess ultimately it’s gotta be all about that $$$$. Time to move on to a different macro tracking app. It’s the end of an era.I have been using fitness pal for over a year and overall was happy with it. You used to be able to update your daily weight from the food diary page. Now its a search through the app and difficult to find. I still have not found the progress page that has the graph of your weight and all your weight entries. 
   Also used to be able to access the nutrition info from that main page and now have to go into the “more” area. Not a huge issue just more clicking around. 
  On the plus side entering food is simpler (thank you!) overall in the past was a very great app for tracking food and macros. My macro totals used to be on the diary page so i could tell how close I was. I don’t see that anymore either. Bah!The basics of tracking calories work well, this app has helped me lose 30 pounds. 

However, there are a few bugs that are becoming increasingly frustrating. The app very frequently doesn’t not sync with other apps it should sync with (Fitbit and iSmoothRun come to mind). Sometimes if I’m planning out meals a week in advance and inputting then, one day will turn blank and the app will need to be force quit and reopened in order to add items to meals. User created recipes very frequently do not sync properly or simply do not save and this is especially frustrating when trying to accurately count calories and macros for a home cooked meal. These issues have been happening for several updates now, would be nice if they could be fixed.Overall this is a great app. It is however missing a few key features, abs maybe these are opened up with the Premium subscription. For example, it doesn’t add your workouts and calories burned from the Apple Watch/Apple Fitness app. This should be integrated without question. Also, you can’t build a meal that you make at home and instead have to add all of the ingredients. This is fine if you can then put them into a single meal, but you can’t. 

I would pay for the Premium if it was a single pay options, but there’s no way I’m paying $80/year for this app’s features. 

Overall it’s great at tracking your food and meeting your daily calorie/protein goals, but needs some modifications to the UX.I’ve had this app for almost 7 years. It’s a great app if you want to track the food your eating, calories, and nutrients. I feel the older version was better for tracking weight.  It is more confusing now to track weight and see my past weights. The most beneficial feature of this app was the barcode scan. It was so useful for me to find something that I did not want to search or couldn’t find by searching. But now you have to pay for it and that is very disappointing. But with them doing updates often there are very little bugs that I’ve encountered. This would be a 5 star if tracking weight wasn’t as confusing and the barcode feature was still available.Pros: Still likely the largest crowdsourced database of nutritional info out there, which IMO is the most important feature for tracking consistently as the more friction points (like having to manually enter calorie or macro info) you have the less likely you are to do it.

Cons: The latest UI changes are a disaster. It used to be extremely intuitive and easy to enter in your diary, it automatically prompted you with foods you’d typically pair with whatever your first entry was and it used to be easy to see what had been entered. The changes made in the most recent version add significant friction points for the most regular actions. As many reviews have stated, stop messing with your UI just for the sake of it.The app was much better before UnderArmor took over. 

Now it is clogged with adds and superfluous features. There is too much clutter on the homepage, with a feed that is clogged by videos and MFP blog posts (some of which share fatlogic and other misinformation - kind of counterproductive considering this is a calorie tracking app...)

There used to be a way to block those posts, but it’s apparently gone now.

While I do like the barcode scanner, too many entries contain the wrong information. And there seems to be no way to edit those entries within the app, forcing users to search for accurate (or create entirely new) entries and rendering the barcode feature useless.

A recent issue I’ve had: this app drains my iPhoneSE battery rapidly, consuming at least 1% of my charge per minute. App and iOS are both up to date, and a quick google search shows other users reporting the same problem. My phone also overheats while using this app, a problem I do not have with any other app on my phone.

3/5 stars - I would consider trying out another app if I didn’t have my weight management data recorded here already.I’ve been using the app for years….my latest streak is 2,234 days!  And I’ve been one of your biggest fans, recommending the app to many people over the years!  But I’m about at the end of my rope. I get it - you want me to go Premium so I’ll pay. But no matter how many times a day you splash the Go Premium screen (and now it’s EVERY TIME I launch the app on my iPad) I’m not going to do so. Once a day?  Great!  Twice a day?  We’ll, okay.  But ever time?  Argh. 

And the latest change for adding food…moving the + to the far right of the items…..worst design ever!  The + is fine…just needs to be to the LEFT of the food for easier viewing and operation.     Might be fine on a small phone but not on an iPad.I’ve never written a review for an app, but have enjoyed this one long enough as to get pretty perturbed by the changes. The updates are absolutely god awful and devolve what was once a fantastic app. If you now hit a meal option and go to log calories, it asks you once again what meal you’re logging. I ALREADY TOLD YOU. (Ex; lunch) 
Please tell me this is a glitch? 
Additionally, is it after midnight? Backtracking to the day before is now either impossible or too difficult to waste my time. I’m sorry but if it’s 12:20, you’re yesterday’s calories. I hold hope you’ll fix the app, otherwise, I’ve been a loyal user for years and will seek an alternative. It was absolutely amazing for tracking over the years and I’d have nothing but good things to say prior to this review.This is the second review of any app I’ve ever used, and it’s mainly for feedback purposes. The apps core functionality of tracking your diet, your macros, your exercise, and even the integration with FitBit is really innovative but so poorly executed. 70% of the time it won’t execute searches properly. Most of the time it’s not connected to my Fitbit unless I disconnect and reconnect it. Currently I’m at work trying to access the desktop version of the app, and it’s not loading. I can only assume this is because the mobile and desktop apps share the same server. 

Without the application connecting to the internet to fulfill its searches, and connecting to my fitness devices, this app isn’t useful at all. I’d get better results from writing down what I’ve eaten.I have had issues with this app since I downloaded it. It hasn’t been horrible, just annoying enough to make you want to throw your phone.  The app goes very slow, freezes often, and doesn’t save recipes like it says it will. Also, I have to get a new phone and reinstall the app. When I signed back in, all of my data was lost. Everything! I tried to sync more 20 times over 2 days and it said, “failed. Will try again later.” Well, after 48+ hours, it still has not synced. I sent a message to Support and haven’t heard anything back yet. 

This app works great for tracking calories and macros. Just make sure you have more than enough patience for it. You’re going to need it.This new add on to track fasting feels so half baked and broken, that I feel compelled to bring it from a 5 to 3 stars because of how frustrating it is.

Constantly have issues saving a fast or manually log a fast because of a “overlaps with your current fast” when there’s no fast currently running. Even trying to log a previous day fast it’ll error, or even stopping a currently running fast will error sometimes saying it’s overlapping a non-existent fast.

Secondly, you cant start a fast on the same day that ended a fast. So you need to wait to midnight the following day to track it. Like why are there such strict rules and limitations over fast tracking?

You’re much better ignoring this feature all together, and using another app for tracking fasting, till they actually put dev time to make it useable.

Outside of those issues, the ability to help you choose and swap between 3 levels of fasting is nice. The feature visually looks promising, but even with the fast minor update, it’s still been useable most of the time.App is good for tracking food no doubt…but obviously people are not purchasing premium membership unless you’re extremely serious about tracking every little detail (macros, micros, etc.) to the exact amounts. The app started out great allowing you to do all those things without paying, but now they’ve slowly began taking away those abilities and added them to the premium membership. Several things you can no longer do without purchasing the premium version (barcode scanning, tracking macros per meal, etc.). Now it’s just basic look up food and add it to the diary forcing you to get premium for things that used to be available for free.So this app is AMAZING for tracking calories/nutrients. There is one bug however that is making this hard. I am noticing that foods I have created before are not appearing in my foods anymore. I add every food I can if accurate nutritional info is available and am noticing foods I’ve added before don’t show up now. I have no problem adding them again but i keep getting a “food already exists” if I try to add again which is annoying. Some foods I’ve altered the name the best I can so I can add them again but I don’t wanna run out of ways one day and not be able to add it ever again.  Hope this gets fixed and would love to change to 5 starts.Been using this app for 626 straight days and it’s helped me lose over 100 lbs. Many are complaining about having to pay for the service at all, but I would have been willing to since I use it so much. However, $20 a month? To use simple features that have always been free like barcoding scanning and macro tracking? Come on. At least introduce a tiered service plan. I’m sure people who watch all the videos and use all the recipes and all that stuff get $20/month out of it… but most people JUST use it for calorie tracking and forcing them to pay $20 to use features they’ve always had feels VERY predatory.So.. I love this app it’s great, being a teen and doing this. Tracking what I need to eat and what I don’t. What I’m very frustrated about tho is when you get your goal of steps for the day (mine is 10,000) it updates automatically on the home screen but once you click on the diary tab and go to that screen let’s say you had negative calories it doesn’t make them positive it’s super slow so i have to wait for the next morning to see how many calories I was actually negative by. This is not helpful because then I can’t fix this on the day like walk some more to burn more or something. Plz fix this and make more quicker on the diary tab for the steps and calories burned for that day. Thanks!!
DebsI switched to this app from another because my husband uses it and we were able to share meals one to another. Then that feature disappeared. Fast forward to after I had my second baby we went back to calorie tracking and I immediately noticed that the pop-up ads promoting the subscription were obnoxiously frequent. I was willing to use it anyway until my phone updated this morning and THEY DOWNGRADED THE FREE VERSION AGAIN so that I can’t use the barcode scanner without the subscription ($$$). That honestly was one of the best features and they had a large database of foods. But I’m done. That was the last straw.I used this app for YEARS—I actually had a login streak of more than 2500 days (that’s more than six years!) until it ended at the start of the pandemic when I had other things on my mind and lost the streak but still used it occasionally. Over those 6+ years, not a single bug was ever fixed, no new features were introduced aside from the Under Armour buyout and premium program (which has nothing interesting or worthwhile in it), and not even any aesthetic upgrades or changes (such as font, colors, or design) were made. Functional? Technically, sure. Best app of its kind on the App Store? Most likely. Respectable or respectful of its users? lol.When I first got this I was very happy. I could link it to my Fitbit to help and monitor calorie and exercise. For the last two weeks there has been several problems. MyFitnessPal got hacked, it would sync with Fitbit (tried server alert times and methods) AND it won’t recognize my password. I’ve had to reset/change my password at least 5 times. Not sure it’s worth the time and frustration. June 27: The original problem with not syncing got fixed, BUT the same problem is happening (several days now), even though they just did an update. I’m not sure if this only affects Fitbit devices or all activity devices :-(... The app does a good job of tracking calories & nutrients.I’ve been using MFP for many years. I have a 1875 day use streak. It’s been very helpful in tracking calories and I’ve sustained a 100lb weight loss for years. I would definitely consider myself a MFP power user. 

It was a HUGE mistake to take away iMessage integration to share food items and have nothing to replace it with. It was a tool that I used in the app DAILY. It’s extremely awkward to copy and paste an entire meal from your friend’s diary just to get one food item. I’m extremely disappointed to see a degradation in functionality. The new owners promise updates... but who knows?

Also, MFP pro is a waste. Waaaay to much money for little additional benefit. Make it a $1 a month and I’m sold.A good app but there are some annoying bugs like if you create a meal then add it from your diary a lot of the time it won’t show up in your diary afterwards but it will subtract from your days calories and add to your macros… like a ghost meal. Also creating a meal is pretty straight forward but if you want to edit it after none of the calories or macros will change even if you take half the ingredients out. For anyone serious about tracking their calories and diet, meal prep is is a must in my opinion, and right now this apps bugs make that difficult. There are a lot of good things about this app too but rn the bugs affect me on a daily basis.This update breaks functionality with Apple Health tracking, while also changing the UI so that the user is inundated with advertisements, premium upgrades, and an increasingly terrible experience. 

I miss the good all days when my MFP worked as a fitness tracking app, and only threw one advertisement at you. Now the app is filled with 99 ways to make you pay for unnecessary things, and punishes you if you’re just trying to track your calories.

Listen MFP, you’ve already got my data and make money off advertisements; y’all need to chill, otherwise your users are going to bail faster than Netflix subscribers.App is good for what it is. Tracking calories and it’s library of food is top notch and the reason I keep using it. My problem is how they keep taking the functionality away from the free users and move them into the paid version.

For years I have used the barcode scan to easily scan my food, but now that is locked behind a paywall. How about instead of taking functionality away from free user, you give them meaningful reason to make the payment. Having a timer for my intermittent fasting isn’t great to pay for when there are a bunch of other apps that do it well for free.I had been using the free version of this app for a couple of years to track all of my macros due to having unexplainable kidney stone development. Being able to scan my foods barcodes was such a nice feature and made tracking my calcium, sodium, and sugar a little easier to handle and manage. I am very disappointed that all of the sudden after an update, I am no longer able to use the scanner unless I pay for the premium app now. All along I was using the scanner for almost 2 yrs and now you decide it should be a paid for feature. Unfortunately, this app is useless to me now and I have to find another way.I have used this app for years and loved it, never having any issues; however, the last month or so, it has been glitching horribly. It will freeze and not let me select the items I need or it will close all together, and these things happen literally about a dozen times a day, making what used to be a simple task of tracking my meals a cumbersome one. The app is updated, as is my phone, so I’m left to assume they are maybe slowing the data in hopes I will go premium? If that is the case, it seems like a poor way to try sell your app (I’m not going to give money to something that isn’t working). It is disappointing, as I’ve always loved this service.I’ve had this app for a while. I will admit I used it a lot last year up until fall or so and loved it. I decided to get back into calorie counting and tracking my activity after getting my Fitbit band repaired. Now I can’t get my app to stay logged in, yesterday it synced to my Fitbit and today it won’t. When I try to contact someone for troubleshooting assistance I get bounced from one window to another and never any way to actually ask a question. I log in using my Facebook and today noticed somehow my user name is different than it’s been. I’d love to get contacted so I can get my issues resolved and be able to bump this review to 5 stars. Until then I’m being generous with 3.I like this app for tracking my meals, problem is most of my meals are homemade which requires me to create recipes often. Today I tried creating another recipe and when I finished and clicked save, it did not show up in my recipe list. I had to click save and log for me to be able to use it, but it still does not show on my recipe list. It would also be incredibly helpful if recipe’s could be edited once they are saved. Not all meals are made the exact same the second time around and I find it annoying to have to remake a whole new recipe just to replace one ingredient from the previous recipe, like say switching from Canola oil to Olive oil. Or Pork to Chicken.I really like that you can put almost exactly what you consume on your daily (for example, I can put if I had a Jamba Juice smoothie, but I can’t put any modifications to it). But the whole weight thing really turns me off. Calories and weight are seemingly constantly thrown in your face. I didn’t download the app because of that stuff. I just want a food diary because I have GI problems. I’d probably use it if there was a way to completely hide the calorie/weight stuff. Tracking water and exercise is absolutely fine. But I don’t need to be told how much I should be eating to maintain my weight. It’s not an issue.I’ve used this app for several years.  Overall it’s not that bad and does help with macro tracking.

That being said, I’m obsessive about the proper nutrition information and as such often go to “the source” and enter manually a new food with the nutrition info from “the source.”  However, if I don’t eat that food for several months, it eventually simply disappears from “my foods” and I have to start all over.  

Once I go through the effort of manually entering in a new food “my food” and it’s nutrition, I should always be able to quickly look it up; I.e. it should still be there even if I haven’t eaten it in years.MFP is a great app for tracking food and the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that it doesn’t sync well with Garmin. Garmin sends info to MFP well, but MFP fails to send any info back to Garmin.  I’ve contacted both companies and tried all sorts of “fixes” but anything that works is temporary. So I have to manually calculate my calories in vs. calories out when it should be able to sync and calculate that for me. Also, I have to manually input my weight instead of having it sync through MFP. I know, all first world problems, but it’s supposed to sync and so those are my expectations. Just a little disappointed.Please lower your download age requirement!  I am trying to find a good tracker for my 15 year old daughter because she has high cholesterol. We are trying to convert to cleaner or eating to avoid having to put her on cholesterol medications But as a working parent, I can’t monitor everything that she puts in her mouth. It would be great if she could log her food throughout the day to monitor her nutrition and make sure she is still getting enough calories in with our food modification at home. Apparently lots of teenagers now have high cholesterol due to the diets that they eat and being able to use a nutrition tracking app would be very beneficial.Really bummed. This seems to be the most comprehensive nutrition tracker out there that already has food items I can search for. But as a diabetic, I track all carbs - not just net carbs. I wish there was a functionality to show gross carbs (I’m having to manually add net carbs + fiber to get a true result). Additionally, the barcode scanner does not seem to work on anything at all. 

Overall, I can appreciate most of the features even as someone who is not looking to lose weight, but I don’t think the app is truly worth the yearly price - but tracking carbs as a main focus means you have to purchase premium.I do like this app and the number of options for food tracking. However, it has a few annoyances. Such as even when I log food for a day, it’ll notify me that I haven’t logged lunch yet an hour or so later. Those notifications would be really handy if they worked right but I almost log food less because I just ignore those types of notifications since they are often incorrect. I also keep getting notifications of the same two welcome messages that I’ve deleted several times now. Again, minor but definitely room for improvement.It’s a great app for tracking what you eat and it probably has the largest database of foods out of all the calorie counting apps out there. Having said that, locking total daily macros behind a paywall is ridiculous. Totally understand the community, recipes, workouts, ect being subscription but having to pay monthly to see your macros that you as the user are inputting anyways is crazy. I only switched to this app because of the seamless sync with Fitbit. If you don’t need the app to sync with Fitbit, then I would look elsewhere. There are lots of calorie counting apps out there that don’t require you to pay monthly to see your macros.I really like MFP for tracking calories and macros. I am increasingly frustrated with its apple Watch integration. What worked at one time stops working. You can bypass the system and add your own workouts but that pretty much defeats the purpose of having a tracking app. I’d like to see the app developer spend more energy in fixing this problem. MFP is probably the most popular calorie tracking app and it is designed to work with other apps which makes it an excellent resource, they just have a few bugs to work out. All in all it is still my go to. I’ve tried a few others and MFP is just easier.I do like that it has so many foods/brands in the database and is compatible with other interfaces since it is one of the top calorie tracking apps. However, my husband and I stopped using it a year or two ago because the scanning capability was taken away (unless you pay). Another huge feature that was valuable to us was the ability to share meals with each other. I am using MFP currently as a quick way to get back into calorie counting because I’m familiar with it, but will be looking for a new one that offers these other features in the mean time.I used this app back in 2013 I’m assuming when it was newer because it was free and amazing. I loved the easy tracking and my watch syncing with it. I lost a ton of weight by using it. Recently in the last 8 months I’d say I went to use it more religiously again and I ended up deleting it. So many unnecessary ads and then, paying to scan and whatever other things on there you didn’t have to before. I just can’t understand the point in changing to basically make people not want to use this app. It’s a shame because it was my favorite but I had to find a different one.I am finding this app very helpful for tracking but it is buggy and has sometimes challenging to navigate.

Buggy - Sometimes when I call up the “diary” tab it shows I have entered zero information. When I go back to the home tab it all comes back but it’s odd that this happens on the diary screen.

Quirky - when I go in my fitness pal online I can enter activities and estimate calorie burn but I cannot access that calculator in the app. Entering exercises is challenging. It also doesn’t have a HIIT category. Lastly I cannot figure out how the app calculated calories lost from walking, and sometimes I gain those calories back inexplicably.So in the previous free version the scanner for the barcodes was available to any user but now the scanner is only for premium. Would you pay close to $60 for a full year which is kind of lame just to be able to use the scanner  method. In my opinion it’s really not worth paying $60 but the scanner should be free for anybody part with the free version. I really think that this app should be free and if anything I feel like also if you do end up paying the $60 I feel like your insurance should cover it too since it does have to deal with health related accounting and Tracking.After doing a 30-day Premium trial, I determined 2 things: I only used the food tracking and the synching the app does from my Apple Watch and Apple Health. I lost 9 lbs and have another 10-15 lbs to go. I don’t need the videos, recipes, etc. It would be nice to have a slimmed down version of this app with a slimmed down price. $20/month (or $80/yr) is steep for my needs, yet I can find no other app than can provide what I need that I trust. At the most, I would want a 6 month subscription. In this economy, it would be nice if companies could come up with multi-tier pricing to accommodate all users’ needs.",3,"Features Not Worth The Extra MoneyGood, but could be better.Great for tracking meals.

I’ve also switched up my workouts to consist of strength training and yoga with little to no cardio. The results are amazing! However, more muscle made me hungry but because the new muscles disguise a multitude of sins without really realizing it I’d put on 20 lbs. I knew I had to do something so I re-installed this app and started tracking every bite, not to “diet” but for informational purposes. I track it all with no judgement and use the journal to go back and see what or how much of a good thing might actually be dong to me. It makes it easy to figure where to cut back if need be. It’s fun to look up different foods, make meals, and get a sneak peek at what I could weigh in 5 weeks time.So let’s talk about the things that make this app as close to perfect as you my hope for. It does a magnificent job communicating with my tracking device. That’s a huge plus. I liked it well enough that I bought the premium version, and I have no regrets. The food database seems more than extensive enough to meet my needs. I have also enjoyed reading some of the associated blog bits and other similar items associated with the home screen.

So I have described a five-star App, and yet I have only given it three stars. Why? I use the iPhone build-in screen reader called VoiceOver. This app works only marginally to moderately well with that screen reader. That is truly unfortunate, since there is so much of which MFP is capable. I would slim down more easily if the folks who created this app would bulk up on accessibility.",0,Consistency is key!The Almost-PerfectWeight Loss Tool,Ug9hNcrabb2011,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,349,has_tracking,354

There are so many ads now which I understand. But some of them pop up on your feed right when you open the app and there are some really gross images. A lot of times I am eating when I enter my calories and the images for the weird ads are so gross it makes me stop eating and lose my appetite. There was one that came up for weeks that showed someone getting ear wax removed. Now I logged in and it shows a close up of someone removing some type of gross substance from the back of their throat. Why would you have these kinds of ads show up on the home page of a food log app? 

Also, if you sync with Fitbit it enters your workouts automatically but it also tracks your steps and gives you a calorie adjustment for that as well, which Is like double tracking. If you go for a run for example, it will sync the workout from fitbit and give you the calories for that, and then also add in your steps from the run and give you more calories which I don’t think is accurate. 

Other than that, no other food app compares as far as the extensive food database and the ease of being able to enter recipes, meals, etc. I also love the social functionality where friends can comment on your status. Of course they have to scroll through all the ads in the feed to find your updates, and overlook the gross images of earwax and other things.I've come back to MFP after a few years and am very pleased at the many improvements in capabilities, user friendliness, standalone mobile usability, social features, and the UI in general. There are 2 glaringly obvious QoL things that are missing.
The first is Recipe Sharing. As it is now, the only way my Hubs and I have found to share entries between people is to copy an Entire meal from someone's diary. It would be much simpler to be able to share the recipe with him on the front end so he could use it as he chooses. It would be even More helpful if we were given a little space to jot down actual directions so these ""recipes"" weren't solely lists of ingredients and I could recreate things. That may be asking too much though.
The other, much more important issue is that there isn't a setting to switch from displaying Total Carbs to Net Carbs (total Carbs-Fiber). There isn't even a way to show macros and Fiber at the same time to do the math yourself. The custom settings only allow for 3 nutrient selections (you'd need 4 to show Carbs, Fiber, Fat, Protein). This is something that needs to be updated ASAP.
Oh, and fyi if you're using a macro based method know that you'll need premium to get access to those tracking features.I love this app still do there isn’t a better alternative. So it saddens me to say this but I’ve discovered a big problem that apparently has been an issue since at least 2015. I just recently got into tracking my macros and apparently for at least 7 years now for some people the macro tracking will not work. I set my macro percentages up and everything’s good I go back to my Home Screen and macro values will not update. This isn’t limited to the app either the values will not update on the website either. I’ve tried everything uninstalling reinstalling, powering phone on and off, logging out and back in on both the app and website nothing works. One example is my protein value in my macros is set to 50% which should be 280g. However everywhere else that value shows up except for where you set your macros the value for protein is over 400g. I sent in a help ticket on the app but judging from what I’ve seen on message boards and forums plus the amount of time this problem has existed (at least 7 years that’s just crazy) I don’t think I’ll be getting much help or resolution for this problem at all.I’ve used this app consistently for over two years and generally speaking, it’s very helpful for tracking calories i’m giving me a good picture of the nutrients I’ve consumed each day. I realize I use the free version so the features I wish it had may be included in the version you pay for. I follow a Mediterranean based diet per the recommendation of my physician. The free version doesn’t differentiate between added sugars and natural sugars. I have to eat a banana every day for the potassium and work hard to include a variety of fruits in my diet. every day I get a message that I’m eating too much sugar because of the (natural) sugar in the fruit I eat. The app also tells me I am eating too much fat if I eat an avocado and some olive oil in the same day. These are healthy fats and are encouraged for the diet plan I follow. I just ignore these messages, but for someone just starting out or someone who is easily affected by those messages, it may be worth exploring the paid version or a different app.I really like this app. The free version is pretty comprehensive and I’m sure the premium subscription is even better. You can scan foods to add or manually insert meals you eat frequently for easy access (if you can do the nutrition calculations yourself). It really helps me
Keep track of my nutrition intake while training for marathons and sports. 
One of the things I found to be completely strange is how they graph/report the macro nutrients (per meal/item/daily intake). It makes zero sense and I get almost no value from it. Unfortunately this is the stuff I need to track more than calories so I have to go ignore the graphs and % reported and do my own calculations, which is kinda lame. I am using the free version so maybe the macro tracking is better with the premium subscription (?) but I don’t see why there has to be misleading macro reporting on the free version.It’s tough to complain about a free app but I have to at least mention some things-  MFP isn’t what it used to be. At one point there were zero adds and I was able to fine tune my plans- lots of small features were cut out of the free model. I miss being able to adjust not only the amount of calories I wanted each day, but also what % of those calories came from fat/carbs/protein was super useful. Tracking macros is part of the paid model now. 

These days, if you don’t want to pay anything, MFP is basically calorie counter littered with ads. 

All that aside, MFP is still a very useful free app. It’s super easy to use. Automatically syncs with your phone’s step counter. Very easy to sync with a fitbit. I love that you can just type in whatever food your’re eating and it’ll give you all the nutrition info. Great for counting calories. Solid 4 stars.Food logging is critical to long-term success in dieting. This tool makes it 10 times easier than using paper and calorie books, plus allows detailed tracking, research, and analysis of calories, macros, and 12 important nutrients.
Since most people have their smart phones close by at all times, nothing could be more convenient.
In addition to the phone-based reports, there is a complementary website that provides additional reports and offers an easier way to research foods. The food database is said to exceed 5 million entries, and thus covers many specific products and restaurant chains.
The main annoyance for me personally is the “Home” page on the phone that is cluttered with all sorts of random stuff. Far better would be a design that enabled user to search for topics, and for foods with certain characteristics.I like the new update but the app still has so much more potential. For example the main home screen, we should be able to completely customize the home screen so it can show exactly what we want to see. 

Another thing I would like to see is more data. I shouldn't have to download my data to put into a spreadsheet. I don't actually do this but you guys have the data, show me more. 

Also, it would make things a lot easier if you let us search a restaurant and select what we ate from a menu. 

I should also be able to edit meals or recipes on the fly. If the app has the ingredients attached to that recipe, and say I didn't it with tomatoes, I should be able to EASILY remove tomatoes from that recipe and add it to my diary at the same time. 

I like the app for the most part. But for the money being paid for the pro version. I am not sure it is truly worth it considering there is so much more potential. I do not regret buying the pro version though because I like the extra stuff. But I'm surprised there aren't subscription tiers. 

Overall I do recommend the app and if you are dedicated to loosing weight or tracking your food for other reasons I also recommend the pro version.Ok, I have to say that as far as some  of the other food management apps go, I do like this one, although the annual fee is really a bit too steep (come on folks, we have to spend enough money just to try to eat healthy let alone figure out how to log it all. Give us a break!). But the one feature I wish you developers would consider adding is the “total net carbs”  column when tracking Carbs, Fats, Proteins, Calories. Maybe add it as a choice under the Dashboard selections??  For those of us that are true Keto Carb counters, we live and die by our “Net Carbs” for the day, and I don’t want to take the time to deep dive down into each individual food item in my meals to discover what the fiber content is, and then subtract it out manually and adjust your Carb totals each time.  Any way to help out us poor souls and bring that to the forefront a little??I love tracking my weight and calories using this app— have used it for at least four years. But the latest update is a pain in two respects. 1.  The Home screen won’t scroll easily—I’m using an Apple 11 pro max with the current iOS. 2, the place to log weight is below the screen so you need to scroll to it, and you have to find this tiny part of the screen to scroll or you just end up opening ads. Then you have to click again to enter weight. Previous versions were much easier to use. I’ll keep using it because overall I like the app a lot. I’ll hope they fix the update and go back to something better—like it was before the last change. Old saying: if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.MyFitnessPal is a great calorie counter and health buddy app, but it has two flaws for me: it doesn’t always read or remember when you end your diary for the day, and that can lead to wonky tracking. It also doesn’t clearly show you on the diary page after you’ve closed it out; the look of the icon in the top right doesn’t change. Better indication there would be helpful.

The bigger issue is that as nice as this app is, it’s $80 to $120 per year for premium features. Compare that to Lose It, which has a virtually identical feature set but costs me $15/yr, and you can see my huge problem with MFP. It’s a good app, but there is absolutely nothing to justify a price up to ten times what a functionally equivalent app charges.Been using this app for years and it’s great for tracking calories (although i wish they’d clean up the data, so many inaccuracies you really have to pay attention to what you’re entering.) Unfortunately someone decided to “improve” what was working just fine - now it’s clunky and slow. I’m editing a prior review where i said you can no longer track your weight and all data disappeared; i was wrong, you can still do everything you could do in the prior, better, working just fine version. In my defense i said this because the “improved” one is not intuitive, it’s harder and takes more clicks to get to the info (plus as i mentioned above, it’s slower now.)Overall, this is a great app that makes tracking your dietary intake easy. The food database is outstanding and I highly recommend spending the money for the premium features, even with my opinions below. 

My biggest complaint is the lack of Apple Watch compilations and limit iOS widgets. There is no compilation for a watch face, which is something other similar apps, like LoseIt!, offer. Secondly, the lack of Lock Screen widgets for iOS is a miss in my opinion. Again, competing apps have them. 

Finally, the lack of water intake integration with Apple Health should be there and it is not. You can track your water intake in MyFitnessPal, but is completely independent of Apple Health.I can’t even put into words how much this app has helped me. Diet tracking + exercise tracking = the ONLY healthy way for me to lose weight. And THIS is the holy grail of tracking apps. There is nothing better out there. 

Two issues that bother me: 

1) When you enter a recipe, you can’t use foods from My List or your history. I shouldn’t have to tell you why that’s lame. 

2) Sometime recently a new feature was added that allowed the user to “Report a Food” (scroll down to the bottom of the screen after scanning a barcode). Before this feature, that would’ve been my main complaint. It had been so frustrating when you’d scan something and the nutritional info would be wrong! Now you can click “Report a Food” and enter the correct info. So, wow, fixed! Thank you! But, ok, when I first noticed this feature (January?) it had a great thing where, after you entered correct info, it would ask you if you wanted to add  the corrected food to your My Foods list. Where did that go? Now I enter corrected info, and then that correction just disappears into the ether! What?! Why?! Does MFP even review these corrections?I’ve been a long time free user of MyFitnessPal, and premium member for 2 months now. I have a year subscription, but am debating to renew it next year because I am comparing different food tracking apps (Ate, MyPlate, etc) and their visual progress approaches. Meanwhile, I LOVE MyFitnessPal for holding all my data and providing access to resources on the app, I really wish we could log pictures of our food for visual users AND to improve our relationship with food. We already have the option to add progress pictures which I enjoy. The dealbreaker for me is the option to keep a photo journal along with the food log journal on the app, especially considering the price of subscription.

PLEASE CONSIDER PHOTO JOURNALS FOR MYFITNESSPAL!!!I like the tracking for the most part.  I really use it to maintain my weight and track the food with calories.  Lately the app stutters, I go to enter my weight for instance and I’m popped back to the dashboard.  The same happens when trying to add food. I started using the exercise tracking but I do at least 3 days of weight training which at this time isn’t allowing the tracking of calorie burn.    It’s an annoyance and I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5.
Adding individual food this app is very handy, i am a bit ADHD and adding a whole recipe is too time consuming for me.  I have follow some of the exercise programs and even used a couple of recipes that are listed.Hey, the Fasting Tracker is a great option… or WILL BE a great option when I am able to track my daily fasting pattern which begins yesterday at 8pm, ends today at 10am and starts over today at 8pm. So far, I can only track fasting once per day… and when I try to start tracking again in the evening, I cannot. I get the message “YOU ALREADY LOGGED A FAST FOR THIS DAY“... Yes, because I don’t start fasting at 12:01am.. I started after dinner last night, as I do regularly.

And… could you please add an automatic fasting option, in which fasting begins at the time of my last food recorded? Then I could ‘end fasting’ by logging my next food intake, or manually update the fast time period.

Update please.This app is probably to go-to for nutrition tracking. Pretty much any food you can think of is already preselectable in a database, and then the app tracks all your macro and micronutrients, as well as water intake, as you go. It also tracks calories burned and exercises done, but I don’t mess with that feature too much. Great app, but I have some features that I think should exist, and some general gripes:

•The app is lacking in tracking all vitamins. It really only tracks vitamin A and C, and that’s a little minimal. Likewise for minerals. It might also try incorporating amino acid intake as well. 
•Maybe it’s my phone, it the app seems exceptionally poorly optimized. When I type something or click something, there’s never NOT a three to ten second input lag. Makes it a pain to type my meals.
•The app should add a daily water goal just like a daily goal for everything else. A lot more useful than getting thrown what I’ve drank in raw ounces with no goal to compare it to. And there’s literally a rule of thumb mathematical formula for it so it shouldn’t be hard to incorporate.
•For the most part I really like My Fitness Pal.
I like that it remembers my food. Although I often have a difficult time finding what are pretty common items. At least once I do I can save them.
My main frustration is the fact that it frequently stops tracking my steps. It shows that I have set it up to do so, but it just stops giving me the exercise credit because it has stopped counting steps. This has happened so many times that I have given up on fixing it this time. It hasn’t counted my steps in six weeks. I’m tired of deleting and restarting the program. 
Lastly, it often locks me out. That happens to my husbands all the time too.This app is really helpful for tracking your calories and macros, however I’m a little curious about some of their percentages. I’m wondering on what planet having no monounsaturated fats in your diet is considered healthy. According to this, I’m not allowed any monounsaturated fats, which is totally ludicrous because healthy fats are key to weight loss. Also, according to this I’m allowed an unbelievable amount of carbohydrates which for me I know I just going to cause me to gain weight.  Maybe in the premium version you can determine your own macro goals, but in the free version I’m just not sure the ratios they’re aiming for are healthy.I would like better if there was an “easy” user friendly detail button that shows: Fitness/ Activity In: # of daily steps, distance in miles, and # of calories burned

Currently I have 3 different apps that I use for info on tracking my food/ caloric intake with good detail of nutritional breakdown, my activity broken down completely, and my water consumption

Each app. Seems to report only certain parts of the detail.  That being said... so far I like your app as the most acceptable comprehensively!  I guess for simplicity sake, I just want it all in one application!  Thank you for listening! 🌞😎👍I enjoy using the app. I’ve been on and off with tracking my diet, I like that all my information is saved regardless of having deleted the app many times. I would love for this app’s premium features to be free. This is really the only major downside to the app. One room for improvement is that the app limits itself to track the amount of steps for exercise when the Apple Watch is connected to the app. I believe by connecting to the Apple Watch and the iPhone Activity app it should be able to track heart rate and various other parameters of exercise. Otherwise, I recommend this app for personal dietary use!My primary interest is counting calories and macronutrients, not fitness tracking (""you lose ounces in the gym and pounds in the kitchen""). Having said that I recently switched from another app and am very pleased with all the functionality here. For example, you can follow a 5:2 intermittent-fading type diet by setting different calorie goals for different days of the week. 
Cons: the food database is not well edited; there are some suspect calorie values. It focuses on brands, as if everything you eat comes from a package or a chain store. If you are into weighing your food, you have to search for entries where units are expressed in weight vs. volume.This app is really awesome for tracking calories. I need to gain weight and it helps me know whether I’m on track. There’s a huge variety of foods available in their database, which is another plus. However, the app crashes pretty frequently, especially after I first turn on my phone. Sometimes the buttons are unresponsive, and sometimes it just closes itself. Some of the foods also don’t track fiber even when it’s in the food, so I often have to try a few “instances” of the same product to find one that’s completely valid.Great app... if you can stay disciplined to keep up with tracking your intakes. For me personally, I often times forget to input my daily intakes, or am too busy to do so. I deleted the app because it ended up just taking up space and I wasn’t inputting what I needed to. However, a huge opportunity for MyFitnessPal is to implement a widget. If there was a widget that gave easy access to water intake, food intake, and exercise logging, I would utilize this app much more often and also be reminded by the widget to open the app. Other than a lack of the widget aspect, I’d recommend this app to anyone.I wish MFP would actually spend development resources on improving the core function of tracking calories and macros. Why is is still impossible to use a recipe within a recipe? Why is is so hard to correct/update product nutrition info while adding it to your diary at the same time?

They leave alone the aging user interface while adding mostly useless features like exercise (which you can’t remove from your diary view) and social networking features. 

There’s no way to set weight goals based on your body fat % either. If you, like many actual MFP users, you don’t want to be built like a stop sign and actually retain some muscle, you’ll have to do your own research and manually enter your macro allotment. Unfortunate that the app hasn’t come farther than this.

Of course, I’ll keep using it until a better, more intuitive solution comes along.",1,"Gross Pictures with Ads but extensive databaseRecipe Sharing & Net Carbs?Used to be 5 starsGreat but Missing a few thingsGreat app but some things are just weirdused to be better but it’s hard to complain about a free appUneven Features but excellent diet tool!Lack of customizabilityWhere is the Net Carb??Useful, but newest version not as greatGood, but that price is insaneVery good app, but the “new & improved” version ughOverall Good, but needs better Apple Watch & Widget supportHEY DEVELOPERS!!!

Even if you’re not planning on changing your eating habits, it helps to just track what you’re eating with MFP. There’s a whole world of nutrition and forums, videos, websites, cook books and apps dedicated to this type of thing. You can get into it all by starting with a calorie counting app like this one.

I don’t use any of MFP’s features except for the calorie tracking ones. I do use the “recipe” feature a lot as it lets me portion out big batches appropriately. For example, earlier today I knew to portion a beef stew I made into 11 servings so they’d be at 538 calories each. How would you get that kind of insight without carefully tracking he ingredients of a recipe? You wouldn’t.

My one complaint is that I’ve had the recipe app crash MULTIPLE times while I’m in the middle of cooking. Obviously this is a pain because I can’t just remember the itemized list of ingredients in painstakingly measured grams. My workaround is to save every few additions so I don’t lose too much if it crashes. And it shouldn’t be crashing, I’m using MFP on an iPhone 12 Pro. If it’s going to be an ideal user experience anywhere, it should be on this. Can’t imagine how much worse it is on inferior hardware. Get your $;&@/ together MFP devs, figure out how to not let your app crash and lose data.I recently started using MyFitnessPal and it is very helpful especially with tracking food and exercise. There are a couple of things that could be improved and those being on the home page I wished it showed all of your stats-calories eaten and remaining, carbs, fat, protein, sugar, fiber etc. I would also like to be able to set my calorie intake for the day and not have it adjust due to exercise. Maybe there is a way to do that and I just haven’t found it yet. Finally being able to enter the type of diet you eat would be great and then if you are low or high on calories, protein etc it would make suggestions on specific foods to eat to make up for any high or low.  It does tell you if you have surpassed the “limit” but having suggestions would be amazing. I am also able to link it to my Garmin to record steps etc. One last thing I would like to see is an area to record vitamins/medications you are taking and figure those into the daily allowance and a place to record blood pressure, pulse, sleep patterns and other personal health info. Overall I am very pleased. It’s played a big part in losing my first 8 pounds!I really don’t like that I have to track my diet now, but ever since I was diagnosed with type two diabetes, I needed the help, so I turned to this app, paid for the year, and it was also recommended by my nutritionist. I was hoping with the updates there would have been improvements to the recipe discovery feature. First of all it takes a looong time for the menu photos to load. Secondly, I have found some instructions to some recipes are faulty, and how about adding optional swaps to make it easier? For example, if the recipe calls for a head of cauliflower to grate into rice, why not suggest the easier alternative to save time for the busy cook? The alternative could be, buy a bag of cauliflower rice (usually found in the fresh produce section at a grocery store) and measure 2 cups for the recipe. And lastly, it would be great to rate the recipe and share reviews for tips to the recipes. Diet and exercise go hand in hand. The physical fitness tracking works great, but the nutrition and recipe features lack.I love this app and would give it a perfect score if I could get Premium membership with PayPal so my bank information is protected. You can use ApplePay but I don’t use that for all purchases. Also it is nearly impossible to locate how and to actually speak with a human on this app. For free users this isn’t a concern but for those looking to pay a membership it is something to consider. The creators of this app are genius!  There are so many practical tools to track your progress and it interfaces/syncs with multiple different tracking devices. I have a FB Versa 3 and it does well with that. The only other thing I would caution users about that are considering Premium is to join via the website not the app. The in app Premium membership is substantially higher. If you plan to use ApplePay remember that before you click on the in-app upgrade. It’s like a $30 difference for the annual upgrade for Premium. Other than that, give it a try. The team that created this app seems to have thought of most everything. Highly recommend it!Trying to lose weight. I hate dieting, I hate tracking nutrition intake, because it is such a pain. But we’re in a new age, this is sooooo much better, simpler, easier than the old notebook with looking up nutrition & calories on the computer. I love tracking everything now. You get credit for exercise, looking up food is easy to do, I always have my phone with me...  This makes monitoring calories in - calories burned so effortless. It is easy to get caught up in exact #s for each nutrition but I use this as a good guesstimate on calories, carbs, protein, and fat to keep me on track. I can easily go back and edit prior day. I can see weekly totals. 
I’ve been trying to eat more protein and fat and less carbs but fell off wagon for sugar over the holidays and overdoing with healthy fats have been making me fatter. “In order to control something we need to first measure it.”  This app helps me with this. I’m on the 5-2 diet, so fasting 2 days, eating 3 meals, 5 days, monitoring and increasing protein. So far, so good.I gained 10 pounds (and I was already 20 pounds past my ideal weight - ugh) during the pandemic and decided to take the bull by the horns. After researching different diets and plans like WW and Noom, I found that calorie control and the power of community  are some of the key elements that made those programs successful. I came across My Fitness Pal as a free calorie counting app and loaded it. Then I called my best friend and asked her to be my diet buddy. It’s amazing what 3 days of tracking every morsel I put in my mouth has given me. Who knew olive oil is 120 calories/tbsp?? What I love best about the program so far is the ability to load recipes from anywhere on the web. I wish I could do it from my phone! It’s a great shortcut to loading every ingredient separately and so handy for things I make over and over.  I also love that I can have Map My Walk communicate the calories I burn directly to my daily diary. I’ve only just started to use the app but it’s brilliant. The more info I input the more indispensable it becomes.Fantastic tool for tracking what you eat and how that contributes to your nutritional goals. My biggest problem with the app so far is that they allowed users to add data to the nutritional database, and people are STUPID. It doesn’t matter which store you bought your fresh produce from, idiot. Non-standard units for some items - how many calories are in “a slice” of cake? Obviously incorrect data for some items - 112 calories for a half cup but 114 for a whole cup, both supposedly verified. I found myself repeatedly checking nutritional information on Wikipedia so I knew which of the wildly varying options were accurate. The barcode scan is nice because it instantly gives you the official nutritional information instead of some idiot’s estimate. I haven’t used the restaurant menu option yet. Overall, it has been very helpfulThis app is simple and a great way to track calories for those wanting to adhere to a set diet. To get nutrient tracking and other insights, you need to subscribe to a premium membership. I have no problem paying for additional functionality for good apps that I use on a regular basis, but the pricing is outrageous given the developers have priced this similar (or more if you pay monthly!) to something like Adobe Photoshop/Lightroom. The later software is 10 times the complexity and feature set compared to a simple food tracking app, so not sure why My Fitness Pal is opting for this approach rather than something more in-line with the value of the app. So rather than getting $10-20 from me, I am cancelling and they will get zero.This app is the best and easiest I’ve used to track my calories. I don’t have many issues with the UI. The app does what I need it to do. The large database of food and beverages is wonderful. 

I am strictly doing a calorie deficit, so I don’t need premium for more in-depth tracking of macros. One thing that is frustrating about the free service is that it automatically adds steps and workout calories burned back into your allotted calorie amount. I know it’s simple mental math, but there is a psychological element to not seeing those extra calories added back in. 

If you don’t want that, you either have to disconnect your fitness tracker and track your steps and workouts in another app or pay $79/ yr. It is counterproductive and counterintuitive.This app is perfect for tracking my protein, fat, and calorie intake. Although my app store is registered with the US, I was surprised to find out that scans of barcodes on foods from my local grocery store in Japan are recognized and provide all the same useful information. 

One note for the devs; I get a notification at about 8:30AM every morning from the app that says, ""You haven't logged your Dinner for today..."" As this notification still occurs if I've added my dinner from the previous night and finalized the day, I figure this isn't tied to my phone's date/time settings, and instead is tied to some US time. This would be helpful to fix for people travelling, studying, or living outside the US.I have tried to” just watch what I  eat” as well as making healthy food choices in healthy amounts. And working out 3-4 times a week. And yet my weight stayed the same. I am 64 years young and need to lose 30 lbs. After several days using My Fitness Pal, I see that what I thought was a reasonable amount of food to eat was fine for weight maintenance but not for weight loss. Also I have wanted to drink more water. The tracking feature that is built in to  My Fitness Pal is very motivating to me. So easy to track everything on my phone. Food, exercise, water intake. I feel so much mire in control and motivated. I know I will lose those 30 lbs. And increase my fitness. Thanks for such a great product.Why I like most is why I’m a premium member. Adding food is easy. You can scan a barcode and it pops up. Then it remembers that food so you can just start typing and it’s there. 

Also, I like the progress comparisons and how it will do a side by side for you. Your food goals with Macro percentages is also a huge plus. 

All of that is worth this app. My negatives are: the portion sizes are all different. I don’t know the difference between a gram, ounce, cup yadda yadda. If it stuck with what’s on the box it would be easiest. Also, adding exercises is a little bit of a pain. They should be in bulk, like; Pushups (mid, wide, military incline and decline) then I just add how many of which kind I did. Also, it does a great job of tracking my meals but doesn’t really offer any assistance on individual meals. As I’m adding a food, sometimes it will give me a warning (too high or you’ve gone over) but doesn’t offer anything to help me build a compete meal each time. That’s more nitpicking than anything, as I can easily add or subtract to make it work myself. 

Either way, great app and I’ll be keeping it.I’ve been using the MyFitness Pal app for a few years and have witnessed quite a few positive enhancements. The one huge NEGATIVE thing MFP did (in October 2022) is discontinued the use of the barcode with the free version of the app.  This is the reason for the 4 star rating. 
There are other apps out there that offer free barcode scanning and gave a very similar platform as MFP.
With that being said, it is still a good app for keeping track of your calorie intake & loosing weight. It definitely keeps you honest! The food database is huge so it takes a lot of the guess work out of tracking your meals without the use of an accurate barcode scanning feature.I am very thankful for MyFitnessPal. I have used it off and on since 2012! When I stop tracking in MFP is when I fall of the wagon. Lately it has been somewhat glitchy though and lagging. Another thing I’ve noticed in the past 5 months is when you enter a new lowest weight, it doesn’t always pop up the confetti image with how much you’ve lost. I know it may sound silly, but I get disappointed when it doesn’t pop up. I am not sure why sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t? I enjoy taking a screenshots to keep track of the dates I hit certain goals. Hoping that be fixed soon.I love this app.  It makes tracking my food intake easier.  In fact, when I use it my weight does what I need it too.  When I don’t, even when I think I’m doing well eating, my weight fluctuates up or down more than I want it too (gaining fat or loosing too much too quick).

My only complaint is it’s not easy to use for night shift workers who sleep during the day.  It resets at midnight so you either have to enter it all on the previous day before midnight, following day after midnight, or split the food up you eat between two different days.  It would be nice to set a “waking” period, but I usually just put all of it in the day I wake up on.I'm preparing to do full keto after my finals so lately I've just been tracking my normal intake. With the premium free trial, it's very easy to see what foods are more problematic than I anticipated so I can do some swaps.

However, I consistently undereat, so all the articles on the feed as well as the ""progress"" tab (which are geared toward losing weight) are completely useless to be. I think it'd be a major improvement to show relevant articles based on your goals and macro preferences rather than just blanket weight loss, as well as tracking measurements over time instead of just weight.

Make those improvements and it'll be worthy of 5 stars.I’ve used this App in the past strictly just to track my calories as a beginner, but since I’ve progressed in my fitness journey, so has MFP. I’ve linked my Fitbit app and Apple Health and it helps keep my tracking more accurate. The only thing I would say that could use an improvement is being able to link more apps. I’ve been using “Strong” to create my own workouts and track how long it takes, and I wish I could link that to MFP instead of adding every set and strength exercise I did in my workout individually. Other than that it’s a great tool, and I would recommend to everyone.I enjoy using this app to track meals and exercise. I like how it lets you know what nutrients are in a food and whether it’s good or bad. There are two things I see that I don’t particularly like.

1) The way carbs are calculated with eaten - burned = amount from max makes it seem as though you can exercise off a bad diet. This is absolutely NOT the case. A good diet will help you lose weight, but eating garbage food and exercise won’t do a thing apart from wear you out.

2) When you do strength training, it shows that no calories are burned. I realize weight lifting is considering an “anaerobic” exercise, but it still burns calories. The idea that strength training doesn’t burn calories and only helps with muscle mass is outdated. By the way, aerobic exercise also helps build muscle. 

All that said, it is a nice little tracking app, and it’s helped me stay motivated, especially when it tells you “if every day was like today, you will be x pounds in x weeks”. I LOVE that!!Still getting used to the app however, it’s very quick to the touch. There’s not much delay between pressing some thing and an action happening in the search in her face is very user-friendly. My biggest complaint with the app is that I wish it was easier to log things. I wish the buttons were a little bit larger and able to be moved up and edit the home screen a little bit more like tracking water. I find to be a little bit difficult, but I do enjoy that. It keeps track of how many ounces you normally drink.I love the My Fitness Pal app/program.  It’s way better than the other paid weight management apps.  It’s more sustainable, easier to follow, has great tools to learn about macro tracking and workout programs.  I love the the fact that it has recipes that I actually like, my only gripe is that there is no search feature within the recipe section.  When my produce is getting to the end of its life, I want to just be able to search for recipes by ingredients.  If they upgrade their app to include that feature, it would be a five star app.This app is great. It helps me so much with tracking my calories as well as goals. And I am so appreciative of that and all of the other great features. Unfortunately, I had to turn notifications off because they don’t work properly. I get a notification for every meal saying “you haven’t logged your meal”. However, most of the time I actually have logged my meal. So, it’s annoying. It would be helpful in the event I actually forgot to log a meal, but I can’t stand unnecessary notifications. Hoping this gets resolved so I can use the notifications in the event I do actually forget to log a meal.I feel this app is one of the best out there for tracking meals, weight, exercise, etc etc etc. and I’m sure I’ll be using it for quite sometime. But did you really have to change the availability of the barcode scanner? Since I started using the app it was one of the best tools here. But now I have to be a premium member to scan a barcode? I’ll be honest, that’s harsh. From a business sense I see why, but to everyone who’s been enjoying the app for so long (and that’s with all the adds) it seems a bit…well, over the top.I‘ve used this for 2 or 3 years and it’s great for tracking calories. I have the free version though and it has changed quite a bit over the years. It now has way more ads on screen and I used to be able to scan the barcode of food packaging to get the exact ingredients but that is now a premium feature. It’s not terrible and I can still use the app well, but it’s a bummer to lose a good feature. I’ll continue using it though and I’d recommend it for calorie counting.Been using this app for several years on my journey to a healthier lifestyle. I’ve lost 25lbs tracking calories and macros. This app does a really good job documenting your food intake with the diary by meal and for the day. I love the barcode scanning feature. This app lacks the ability to share recipes which is frustrating for my wife and I. We find and create recipes to use in the future. Once loading them into ones app it is impossible to share with each other or with friends. This would be a big improvement and win for users.",0,"It worksVery helpfulFitness tracking good, recipe feature not so muchAlmost perfect!

I would have never gained over 15 pounds in muscle and completely changed my body if it wasn’t for myfitnesspal. A few years later, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. I had to alter my diet entirely. I had no energy to even work out for 3 months while I waited for my body to respond to the changes I made so I stopped using the app, as I only associated it with tracking my macros for bodybuilding. I also had no knowledge of how little calories the majority of my extremely clean diet consisted of, and because of that, I ended up losing 16 pounds. All those years of consistent hard work, gone...just like that. After hearing this alarming number, I immediately started using myfitnesspal again to gain my weight back. I have not only gained the weight back, I have learned so much about the new foods I am eating. I am also happy to say my health is finally turning around and I am working out again!! While my doctor was the one who saved my life, I this think myfitnesspal had an incredibly strong positive impact as well. And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.My son is very under weight and we had trouble keeping the weight on him. He is non-verbal, can only eat smooth food items or shakes, and doesn’t really communicate that he is hungry. We offered food and hoped he ate some of it. It was a random approach and not too successful. We needed an application that we could use at home that would make it easier to keep track of calories and nutrition on a daily basis. MyFitnessPal was recommended by a nutritionist a few months ago and we’ve been using it ever since. The barcode scanner makes it fast to record nutritional information on packaged food. I just figured out the Mobil phone app - big time saver. We are still trying to figure out custom food items and how to record his weights. Instructions are found by separately Googling. It would be nice to have better instructions within the app. BTW he gained 4 lbs in 5 months so tracking was the key. It made us do a better job ensuring the food was consumed.I’m 14 and I’m not overweight I’m just trying to lose weight before track season. I wanted an app to start tracking my calories and downloaded this because I like under armor. The problem was each time it wanted me to sign up it asked for my age, and when I put my actually age, it denied it. So I tired a birthday above the age of 18 and it let me in. Normally I would be ok with that because I have to input a fake age for a lot of things. But it says that we need to put our age for an accurate measurement of calories. So if I lie about my age then how is it going to give me an accurate data? Also what’s the harm in a kid under 18 losing weight? I want this app so I can lose weight without ruining my growth by eating a lot less than I need to. So why is there an age restriction? But other than this the app is good so far but I’m worried that the fake age will be a problem in the future.Been using MFP for a while now and am a premium user. App works great for my needs, until it doesn’t. Apple Health integration is extremely unreliable, and even though it has all necessary permissions, my exercise calories aren’t picked up in MyFitnessPal, and it does a bad job at writing my nutrition information into Health. It doesn’t read my weight either, which is tracked in a different app, and stored in Health, where MyFitnessPal *should* be reading it from. Tried signing out and back in, tried reinstalling app, tried restarting phone. Hopefully this gets fixed, otherwise I’m looking at canceling premium and heading to a different nutrition tracking app.I love MFP, but the app tries to do too much and does none of it well. It’s slow, crashes frequently, and offers less functionality than the desktop website. Ads take up way too much room. Plus, videos in comments either don’t load or play without sound. Mobile website is unusable, which makes app necessary for mobile access. 

I’d go premium, but for premium, (other than removing adds) the extras are pretty slim, and premium is way too pricey. Plus you’re still stuck with that terrible app!!

MFP should consider making a separate community app and beef up their diet/exercise tracking app as a stand-alone app that’s not a nightmare to use.Update-due to mostly my user error (my phone’s settings) and a blip on the app (no pop up to point me to my settings as most apps have-was stuck in a loop), I have successfully installed the premium and have updated my review from 1 to 5 stars. 
I now need only one app for tracking food and modifiable time stamp information, which is crucial for identifying triggers when my glucose rises and subsequently drop. 
I still need to see if there are notification settings (reminders) for tracking such as My Plate has.  Probably does-I imagine I need to turn them on in Settings. 
Overall I have found this app to be one of, if not THE BEST food tracking apps, and I look forward to future updates. (Would be super-awesome to be able to move the order of entries after entered and ultimately have this blend with my Dexcom data.)
THANK YOU MFP!!

Trying to get 30 day free trial premium, but app is caught in a loop...
Please fix-I’ve been looking for a time-stamp food tracker and while I’m not too happy about having to pay for one, I will, if it works!!I have struggled with my weight for a very long time; bad eating habits and injuries didn’t help me keep on track. I recently tore my Achilles’ tendon and normally would have used that as an excuse as to why I can’t stay fit. But, I got on a scale last week and I was disgusted with how much weight I had gained. I’m just one week with tracking my eating, monitoring my macros, and drinking lots more water, I am proud to say that I’m down 8lbs! I’ve never had instant success like this with my past attempts at losing weight. The meal suggestions & motivating message that lets you know you are on track to meet your benchmark keeps me going!!! This really wasn’t hard at all. I’m ready to keep going!!!!The free version of this app is great for auto tracking steps and super easy to keep track of food, even letting you add information about food you create from scratch ingredients. I’m poor or would gladly pay for the premium version. I’ve recommended it to family and friends and, truthfully wouldn’t want to change. But, for the development team and sales team. You allowed an advertisement that looked exactly like a hack screen that almost wigged me out and had me closing the app and making an active scan of my phone. Please use consideration when allowing companies to use ads. Thank you.Love ease of weight tracking. Love calorie logging with available nutrition count. That said......wish I could make changes to my goals on the main page without the nuisance of having to go, and log in to a different page. Biggest complaint is on home page with ""blogs"". Really dislike seeing scrumptious photos of food.......with no link to recipe!!! Recently there were avocado halves with an egg cooked in them garnished with bacon. Sure.....I could wing it. But why should I have to risk messing up a meal. Make it a requirement on blogs. No yummy photo without recipe! All in all, this is best site for weight/health conscious people.I’m a 45 y/o woman. I had gained 2 sizes in just a few months after I started feeling symptoms of menopause. I was eating a third of what I’m eating right now, exercising 4 times a week and I was still gaining weight. 

Once I calculated my macros and I started tracking them, I realized that I needed to eat a lot more, just in the right ratios. This app changed my life! I feel so much better with my body, I have a lot more energy and I’m enjoying all my workouts. 

Forget about Noom, forget about Loose it! Tracking calories doesn’t really tell you the whole story. Track your macros instead!Edit: I love this app. The splash screen asking for location tracking has gone away. Thanks!!! 

I am a premium subscriber being harassed into allowing my location to be tracked. EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app, it “asks” permission to track me. STOP IT!!!!! I don’t want my location tracked!!! You just had a MASSIVE DATA BREACH subjecting 15 MILLION users to phishing attacks! Plus, as a premium subscriber,  I am not supposed to be shown ads. So what are you doing with my data? Why do you want it so bad as to harass me? It’s making the app unusable.  

PLEASE, take no for an answer (NOT “remind me later”) and stop harassing me! Allow me to record my meals in peace.I used to love this app. I even purchased the premium version as I’m now doing Keto and need to track macros. Unfortunately the premium version doesn’t work even though I’m still paid thru January. I’ve attempted to get help thru all avenues found and have gotten nothing! Cannot use my upgrade. Cannot get a refund. Cannot get help! Don’t waste your money on the upgrade!!! Changing my rating to 1 ⭐️ from 4. 

I am new at fitness and weight loss tracking and this app has been a huge help! User friendly and syncs with my Fitbit even though it's an older version. Seriously considering upgrading to the premium version.I use Fitbit for tracking my steps and recently switched from MapMyFitness to Fitbit to track my workouts.   I’m very disappointed that the workouts from Fitbit do not sync over to myfitnesspal - just about everything else does so why not the workouts?????  I’ve also recently noticed some discrepancies in the exercise calories earned.  I had two days where my steps were almost the same but on the first day I got 0 exercise steps and the next day 68 exercise steps.  ?????

Hope you guys work on these issues.  Pretty frustrating.  I pay for premium and I expect these things to work consistently.I can’t believe the things that this app does that my Weight Watchers App doesn’t...and I pay good money every month for the Weight Watchers App! 
The biggest advantage from my perspective is the ability to Save and Track IMPORTED RECIPES from the web! I’m NOT a “Tech Savvy” person, however, I was able to EASILY do this.  My WW app doesn’t even have this capability! 🤬  I just imported, saved, and tracked a Weight Watchers recipe and a Publix Aprons recipe. It even lets you edit the imported recipes prior to saving and tracking them. I ❤️ MFP App!    It kind of makes me wonder why I’m even doing WW?I try to be somewhat competitve as a cyclist and extra weight kills my ability to keep up. What I like about this app is that it will auto upload calories and ""give them back"" toward your daily allowence.  If I am truthful about calorie tracking I will lose weight.  Having to add the calories makes me appreciate what I am eating and if the calories are ""worth it.""  For example I will skip a coke bc I dont want to ""lose"" 160 calries for a canned coke. For me the app works.I was using the food diary on a daily basis for several months with good results- it would make me think twice and I usually made better choices. Then I decided I didn’t need to continue tracking my food and exercise.. and lost my focus. My weight started creeping back!! I decided that the few minutes a day that I spent selecting and tracking foods was well worth my time and effort. Don’t give up and don’t worry if you have a few indulgences- just keep tracking!Tracking every calorie you eat might seem tedious but it teaches you discipline which is the first step in weight loss. I used this app for about 4 months and lost 40 pounds. It works but you have to work for it as well. Always check serving sizes. The app will also notify you if you’re consuming too much sugar, carbs, sodium, etc. If you are a soda addict like I was try diet sodas (only 1-2 cans daily though).

If you are wanting to start your journey into getting healthy but feel overwhelmed with the idea of meal tracking I’d highly suggest this app! The fact that you can just scan the barcode and then input the serving size you actually use makes it so easy! Plus you get to create your own meals and recipes so they are one click away when you eat them. You also don’t need the fret over calculating the tracking info when you eat out, they already have that listed for most major restaurants. 

The only issue I’ve had in the past two weeks or so is the app struggling to record data from my other fitness apps. It’s not been calculating my exercise from the iOS app. I’ve noticed this has been an issue since the most recent update when they changed the setup of the dashboard. Yes I have tried all the recommended steps, reupload all my apps and everything. Make sure it has permission to use the data, etc. Hopefully it’s just a simple bug that can be fixed. I miss having all my healthy data together in one location.I am a 50+ physician who has always struggled with my weight despite being physically active. I started my fitness pal over a year ago and dropped from 250 to 195 pounds without struggling with hunger, after finding out, which foods worked best for me. After reaching my goal, I slacked off on using the app for a while and saw the numbers rise again, and so have jumped back in! I have been recommending this to all of my patients who ask me about weight loss as I am not a big fan of many of the medication’s out there. Additionally, I recommend everyone google the phrase mistakes calorie tracking, and read some of the numerous articles written on the subject because we all have blind spots about our diet and accuracy tracking calories. mine turned out to be not carefully weighing, cooking oils and nuts, and once I did, the numbers really started to move! overall highly recommended! One last note, I recommend people bite the bullet and pay for the year subscription, which will help them to be more dedicated in the first month, which has the steepest learning curve, and after that it will be much smoother sailing!I’ve been a MyFitnessPal user for 6 years now. I want to start by saying when I first started using it, I was using this app religiously. I managed to lose 15 pounds in 3 months. However, I was losing weight for all the wrong reasons and found myself tracking my diet and making sure I was only eating 1500 calories a day when I should have been getting 2000. As soon as I stopped using it, I kept the same weight until I went to college. Freshman 15 is a real thing and that is exactly what happened. I gained all my weight back but it wasn’t just fat, I was gaining muscle too because I found myself weightlifting regularly. 2 years later, I found myself big with a slightly higher than normal fat percentage. That is when I started using my fitness pal again. Now I use this app correctly, and have been losing a moderate and healthy amount of fat a month, by keeping track of my macronutrients and making sure everything that I eat align with my goals. This app does exactly that. Now I have gotten into a routine of logging my food. It used to be a chore, but now it’s a habit and it’s a habit I’m happy to have!I started using my fitness pal right before starting college. Growing up I played a lot of sports which caused me to have to fluctuate in weight between my size for football, and my size for soccer. After graduation I found myself putting on weight due to a smaller amount of calories burned due to practice, as well as keeping the same appetite. It has been a great tool in me learning about nutrition not just for myself but as a whole. I initially  only used the regular version of the app which is completely capable of tracking macros, as well as steps, water, and calories in general. I eventually decided to get the premium version which is completely worth the money when you take into account all the things you spend money on, it is a low price to pay to put that money towards something as crucial as your health. The premium version allows access to easier macro tracking and plenty of recipes and even workouts. Overall myfitnesspalpal has helped me to structure my meal planning and workouts, and help me to deal with some body image and eating disorders.Calorie counting is the key to losing weight, and this app makes it as simple as any I’ve found. I pay for the annual subscription but I don’t honestly remember what specific feature won me over (probably something around macro tracking).

No app can make you disciplined about tracking or how you eat, but the database of foods is pretty good (not flawless) and many design choices help encourage long term use - the ability to save your own recipes and meals and rapidly copy your last breakfast are real wins. I don’t use the recipes or exercise routines offered, and the nutritional info is just spotty enough that I track macros but nothing more granular, so I’m probably only using half of the functionality available or less. That said, it suits my needs well enough and there have been some decent improvements made over time.

I downloaded this thinking I’d use it for a couple of weeks to get a baseline, but it became part of my routine. My streak recently grew to 500 days and I’ve lost roughly 40lb since I started using the app.Certainly a very useful app, and the features for logging meals and counting calories have improved over the past couple years. I often recommend this app to my patients who are obese as we begin their process of weight loss and lifestyle changes. I use it myself for my own training and calorie counting. The exercise recommendations and video blogs accessible through the app can be quite useful as well. The primary deficit currently is the lack of calorie tracking for weight, lifting exercises and the inability to log meaningful strength training sessions. The app does a reasonable job for cardiovascular training sessions. Given the mountains of solid research showing that strength training is probably the single most important form of exercise adults can engage in to achieve meaningful extensions to longevity and improved performance throughout life, I would expect the app designers to invest a lot more energy in promoting and tracking strength training.I started using MFP, about a month ago. I had been slowly gaining weight for about a year and my available wardrobe was shrinking. I knew I had to make a change ,so I looked at a couple of calorie tracking apps and decided to go with MFP, because of the ease of entering foods and the community. 
I synced my FitBit with MFP and noticed that I could get extra calories if I walked and met my step goal for the day. This of course provided extra motivation to get outside and walk when I really didn’t have the desire. My weight loss goal was one pound a week. When I ended the day with several hundred calories left for a couple days in a row MFP let me know that I was being unhealthy and that they would not encourage the behavior. I was really impressed with that accountability as I do struggle with sometimes going to extremes with weight loss. Ultimately, by using MFP I have become more aware of what I’m putting in my mouth and how it makes me feel. I can also already wear more of my clothing!I’ve been using My Fitness Pal for over a month now and I’ve already lost almost 10lbs! Tracking calories truly is the best and only way one can efficiently lose weight, however one should have a healthy mindset about food and do their research I think before doing it. To those who think 1200 calories a day isn’t enough, it definitely can be - it depends on your height and gender. I’m a woman who’s about 5’5 and have been eating 1,200-1,400 calories per day (I don’t try to be strict with it just as long as I’m in a deficit) and 1,200 is definitely doable if you substitute calorie dense foods (processed foods and carbs) for foods that are low in calorie at higher volumes (veggies are a must, more protein, etc). I actually feel more energized and motivated to get things done in my life too. Something that I was so misinformed on and thought was impossible for so long (losing weight) became possible with MFP and I’m really happy.I first downloaded MyFitnessPal back in 2011. I was 20 years old, and my work friend who was using it showed me how. I lost about 25 pounds in about 3 months and I’ve been a believer ever since. I have yo-yoed with my weight my entire life; I even gained and lost almost 50 lbs one time! But with MyFitnessPal, I could always get back on track, even when I felt unmotivated. (The streaks get me to keep logging every day). I also love tracking my progress weight on the graph and seeing my calories in the week view. I feel proud seeing all green bars across the screen! I’m currently on another journey to lose about 30 pounds this time. I’m always shocked to see all my data through all the years still saved. Proof that (if I stick with it), I can utilize MyFitnessPal to correct my unhealthy eating and exercise habits. It’s taught me so much about nutrition I could write a book! I’m a lifer! And probably a longer lifer! Casey 33YOFI’ve been using this app for about 3 years, and just purchased the Premium version within the last year. I loved the app before, but love it even more with the Premium features! I am usually a non-believer that Premium changes much, but it has helped me structure and track my goals more closely. I especially like the freedom to adjust my macronutrients by gram, and to see the overview of my meal entries in grams, not percentages. I have been reverse dieting for about a year, so I appreciate that the app doesn’t see weight gain as bad, and rather reports it just as the stat it is. Many other apps like this are weight loss-focused, so I appreciate MFP’s neutral stance on the goals people may have.
This app overall has been awesome to use. I would recommend it to anyone, and I will keep using it myself for the foreseeable future. It has the flexibility to work with anyone’s goals, and the power to maintain a long history of daily tracking and progress updates.I’ve been a yo-yo dieter for a good portion of my life.  One thing I can’t stand is going on a diet, because then I sabotage myself by having something that is not “on plan.”  With MyFitnessPal, everything is “on plan,” because I’m holding myself accountable.  I know I shouldn’t want or give into the need to have a cookie, but I’m human, and I do.  By tracking my food, I am more than satisfied with my one (or two 😇) cookies because I know what happens when I eat more and that it’s not going to help me lose weight.  Every time I get back on MyFitnessPal, I lose weight.  I lost 50 lbs. in a little over 6 months to get pregnant with my son.  Well, I fell into the pregnancy cravings, and then went through a lot of stress eating after having him to the point that I gained 75 pounds back.  I’m back on MyFitnessPal for about 6 months now and I’m down 40 pounds.  Yes, I still have a lot to go, but I know I’m going to get there because this works.  It’s not a diet, it’s a lifestyle change.I admit I am not a hardcore training kind of guy.  But, even at my level of mild (really mild) training, and paying mediocre attention to what I eat, the FitnessPal app is very useful. I do try to pay attention to making my entries, and because of that, I do watch my calories more so that I would do otherwise.  When I run out of my allotted calories, I pretty much stop eating for the day.  Beneficial from two standpoints:  1) I know what my calorie intake should be, and 2) I actually pay attention to it, from a consumption standpoint.  So, even though I am not enthusiastically training, I am also not just eating everything thinking it is okay.  Just the awareness and self-imposed accountability of tracking is far better than a lackluster approach of paying no attention at all.  I also count my steps, which is personally satisfying, and have my FitnessPal cross-linked to Map My Ride, which my wife and I enjoy using, also.  Thanks for both!!This is a very convenient app when it comes to logging you food for the day, the UPC reader is especially convenient for quickly and accurately logging any type of health prepackaged foods when you're on the go. I recently purchased the Microsoft band which I thought would interact with this app. Unfortunately it isn't quite there yet, it does log my steps from my phone but unfortunately I don't always have my phone on me so the band it likely much more accurate... Although you can add your physical exercise manually in the app so it's more of a convenience issue that anything... 

Overall this is a great app that I have been using for quite some time (well before it was sponsored by under armor)...

I recently (last 3 months) purchased the full upgraded version of the app to track macros as well as additional features and tracking abilities... best $50 I’ve ever spent on my own health!!!!I don’t usually write reviews for anything but I had to with this. This app changed my life. Like many I packed on the lbs during quarantine. I woke up one day and was not happy with the way I looked. Diets are hard, they require discipline and accountability and when the whole world is told to stay away from ppl finding that accountability can be difficult. This app changed that for me. It wasn’t easy but using this app I dropped 20 lbs in two in a half months. Tracking my work outs and calories played a huge role. I am now more aware  of what I eat and feel a sense of joy looking at the macros knowing I am consuming the right foods. I advise you also grab the map my walk app as well and pair the two. It has changed my life and I am grateful for such an effective tool and the past reviews which compelled me to download and try. Of all the fitness apps I downloaded this is the only staple.I’ve been using this app for years and I use it to keep myself honest about snacking and calories. I’ve recommended it to at least 5 other users. Highly recommend.

First my criticism, I’ve had a 120, 100+ and recently a 90+ day login streak reset when I didn’t log my meals for 2 days in a row. On the third day, I added my food for the 2 missing days but I was annoyed and wanted to quit when my streak was reset. The streak length pleases me but the reset really annoys me and instead of inspiring me to log in consistently, it makes me want to stop using the app. I suggest you extend the reset grace period to 72 hours.

Back to good things about app, the UPC scan ability is very convenient, the ability to save meals is handy and I like the long term weight tracking too. I also use the app to determine whether leftovers are still good because I can look up when we ate a meal.As a medical student, I don’t get much exercise due to lack of time. I have gained quite a bit thanks to the stress, lack of sleep and regular exercise. This app is similar to other calorie tracking apps in terms of having crowdsourced calorie counts but what really does it for me is the tracking of macronutrients and the motivational messages that pop up when you log. The macronutrients really demonstrate where your weaknesses lie, obviously in carbs, but also when you eat your most calories. In addition, the little motivational messages of “this food has high fiber” and “if every day were like today you would be x pounds in five weeks” is very motivating. Lifestyle changes is about finding something that sticks, and this app helps me hone in on problem areas that I need to work on especially if I don’t have time to exercise and limiting my intake is the only way to stay healthy.I used MyFitnessPal about 4 or 5 years ago when I started dieting & I had lost about 50 pounds. This year I gained back about 15 pounds and started dieting again. At first my weight loss was at a stand still until I started using MyFitnessPal again and started tracking my calories and weighing out my food portions. The app has changed since I last used it years back but when I logged back in it still had all of my weight loss info from when I used the app previously, which I liked. They have a great feature now that wasn’t on the app when I used it years ago, but you can import recipes from websites and it calculates the nutritional info for you which I love cause I’m always cooking at home. Also they have a huge database for food. I’ve been using the app for about 6 weeks now and have lost 13 pounds. I love this app and can’t recommend it enough.There’s not a diet I haven’t tried; and I’ve been dieting since I was 13 (60 years ago!) I’ve been a Weight Watchers Leader and a “Noomer,” throwing a few other weight loss and nutrition products and plans along the way! The good news is that I’ve managed to maintain my 20 lb. weight loss for years now; but returning to what was once a 30 lb. loss (during COVID) has been a challenge. But one thing’s for certain: The My Fitness Pal app and its associated database is the most comprehensive and easiest to use of all of them! Since I am committed to my health and fitness FOREVER (my body is, after all, the most valuable piece of real estate I’ll ever have), I want to rely on the keys to a lifestyle that open doors to aging well. Call it logging; call it tracking. What gets measured, gets done. And I can’t imagine my life without My Fitness Pal!MyFitnessPal has become an indispensable tool on my fitness journey. This app has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. From tracking my daily calorie intake to monitoring my exercise routines, it's been a game-changer in achieving my fitness goals.

The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to log meals and workouts with just a few taps. The extensive food database ensures that I can find virtually any food item, making calorie tracking effortless. I love how it remembers my most frequently logged foods, saving me time in the long run.

The app's progress charts and personalized insights have been incredibly motivating. It's gratifying to see my progress over time, and the app's gentle reminders keep me accountable and focused on my targets.

Additionally, the integration with various fitness devices and other apps simplifies data syncing, making sure my progress is always up to date. The community feature is a bonus, as I get to connect with like-minded individuals, share tips, and cheer each other on.

Overall, MyFitnessPal has truly transformed the way I approach fitness and nutrition. I can't imagine my journey without it. If you're looking for an app that's user-friendly, comprehensive, and supportive, MyFitnessPal is the one for you. Highly recommended! 👍I broke my foot recently so I’m not moving around so much and working out is limited to upper body for the most part. At 52, and not blessed with great genetics for body weight, if I don’t work out, I puff out. Since I can’t burn a lot of calories right now, I put myself on a 1200 calorie a day plan. Using My Fitness Pal to help track calories has simplified the process. I need extra protein right now for the healing process and the app allows me to track that as well as fiber, fats, and carbs. So far, I’ve had no issues searching for the foods I eat within the app to add to the food diary. I’ve used other calorie tracking apps before and My Fitness Pal is far superior to the others that I’ve used. So far, I’m only using the free version but I am considering upgrading to the premium after using this app for one week.I love MFP! I’ve used a lot of calorie tracking apps before and always went back to this one. I feel like they have more accurate numbers as far as scanned foods and more options available. It’s very rare that I have to create a new food. I’ve been using an FP for a little over five years now and I’ve lost 40 pounds give or take a few pounds. It has really helped with calorie/macro tracking along with more mindful eating.
I had to write the review now because of the newest update that I noticed today which is June 10, 2022. It’s more visually appealing and everything is all there for you to review steps/calories and macros. 
I did buy the premium subscription because I wanted to be able to edit my numbers and I’m so glad I did I will continue to be a happy customer.This app has an incredible database of food. I’m impressed with the number of product specific foods and regional choices. I like being able to track my weight over time. I like being able to add exercise and water tracking. I really like seeing a breakdown of my macro and micro nutrients. I can adjust my nutritional abs weight goals easily. Adding foods to your diary gets easier as the app keeps a record of what foods you’ve entered before. I’ve created my own recipes and added those to the database. It’s a very user friendly program. Occasionally there are errors in the nutritional info, but that’s easy to forgive given all of the other strengths of this app.  I’ve checked out a few of the other tracking apps and I find this one to be far superior. I don’t even use the premium version and I love it.I have used MFP off and on for the past two years - but as of this past April and my recent engagement I have become much more committed to logging in and keeping track of my calories and nutrients. I love when I get little notifications (You have a 65 day login streak - keep it up!) and the articles and recipes on the main feed are great. I have an active job so in the past I would over eat, thinking that I burned more calories than I had because of the physicality of my job but MFP has helped me to get a better understanding of my actual activity levels and how much I am consuming. I love MFP and appreciate what it is doing for me. Finding the right foods can be frustrating at times and it does take dedication to log all your food, but if you truly want to get healthy this is a great tool to help you do so!I don’t usually take time to do reviews, but for this app, I felt I needed to. I’m a 6’2 adult male in my early 30’s. I was 330lbs just 6 months ago when I downloaded this app. I literally have not and do not exercise regularly, other than walking about 2 miles a day on my job. All I have done this past 6 months to lose weight is use your app as a calorie, protein, and nutrition tracker. I also switched from diet soda, to water or coffee exclusively. I stay under my goal daily calories, log everything I eat, and have gotten great results. I am now down to 258! I’m planning on being at 230 within the next 3 months which will be my new goal weight!
Thank you all for this amazing app! Hopefully someone will read this and it will motivate them to get to calorie tracking. It really does work!Hey 👋🏼 

I am Tonya, a “new” MyFitnessPal member. I am a native SoCal girl that has never fit the SoCal stereotype. Instead I always feel too short and too curvy. I have struggled with my self image and disliked my full body for my entire life. Then I look back at pictures and think 🤔 “why was I so hard on myself I was a little cutie pie!”🥰 

I am tired of trying to fit into a mold I will never match and my journey is to just love me, as I am! My priority today is to be fit and healthy. I have been unmotivated and in a rut for FAR TOO LONG!

I have always known tracking my food is the most effective way to manage my weight. However, I kept letting fear and doubt stand in my way, UNTIL NOW! 

I downloaded MyFitnessPal app last week and I am so glad I did! This app has everything I need to be successful. I have found just about every food item I search for and love the food barcode scan option! I like the option to add new food items that are not currently in the database. It’s fun to be a small part of the app. 

I love that MyFitnessPal connects to and tracks my exercise. Plus I earn credit calories! That is what I call instant gratification! YEAH!

Five pounds down, thirty five to go. Wish me luck!

THANK YOU MyFitnessPal TEAM! BIG HUGS 🌸🤗💖After 3 weeks of vacations eating out in restaurants, I NEEDED something to hold me accountable to get back on track. A friend mentioned this app to me, and told me to try the free version 1st.  I was so impressed with the ease to use it and the reminders to log in I went ahead and paid for a subscription.  Because of the easy to use tools and awesome feedback, I’m on track to hit my 1st goal and haven’t been this excited about logging my food daily!  Usually I give up on that part and never get any weight off.

During this time, my Dr. Office called to tell  me I was too high on cholesterol on my bloodwork.  I then started paying even more attention to the nutrition tracking part of the app which has really helped to learn about the foods I’m eating and how many mg per day I’m eating.

Additionally, I had purchased a Garmin Venu SQ2 to help track my steps and golf game.  I was so excited to finally get it to sync to MFP so now my steps automatically update in the MFP app!  I can have an extra “Treat” once in a while knowing how many calories I burned during the day!

Please thank your tech & development team for this awesome app!  I’m 62 an loving it!On January 27, 2020, I weighed 236lbs. I started utilizing MyFitness Pal, on March 1st, 2020. First day that we were instructed to stay home from work because of COVID. Since March 1, started utilizing this app track my meals and daily fitness activities. I would say, MyFitness Pal has become my best friend and life saver. I am no longer on high blood pressure medication, and I’m eating healthier then ever. My current weight is 192lbs. And throughout the year my regular weight range is from 188lbs-195lbs. No crash dieting, just monitoring and eating according to the caloric value that my dietician help me to determine. This value fits my current life style. That one time cost of meeting with a dietician, utilizing this free app, and tracking my meals and food intake is all that was required.The App is absolutely fantastic for tracking calories, food intake, easy to search. My main gripe is that one of the best features of the app, was the ability to quickly input your daily information with the plus button for food, weight, water, etc has been taken out completely. I made the most progress when I was able to input my weight, take a picture, and see my before and after as a sign of growth, but this feature is so difficult to get to and find now it’s making me want to choose something else for my progress. Great app, wish inputting weight didn't take such a step backwards in the UI.This app is easy to use, helps lose weight and stay on track, holds you accountable, and shows daily macro and micro nutrients. You can scan barcodes on food, which makes tracking easy. I love all the articles and tidbits of info from the app. At the end of the day when you complete your diary, a note pops up saying what your weight will be in 5 weeks if you keep eating the same. This is very motivating to me because it shows long term progress.

I started using this app 4 months ago when a registered dietitian recommended it to me. My BMI was slightly over 31 and is now 28 (after losing 23 pounds). I’m still losing weight and have more to go, but this app has been a huge part of my weight loss and developing healthy long term eating habits!They don't have enough stars to rate this app. I rate it a 15 star out of a 10 star rating. This is the best way ever to track the food you put into your body, at the end of the day you click ""Complete Diary"" and it tells you how much you would weigh in a month if you eat like that every day. Pair MyFitnessPal and Under Armour Record and you are set for success. I lost 20 lbs in a month, I've never been able to do that before and this app helped me so much. It helps you be aware of the bad foods you're putting in and it tells you when you go over your limit for what a person your height, weight and age should be eating (yes they ask those questions before you start tracking.) MyFitnessPal is the best app ever for nutritional fitness.Currently I am tracking micros and love the feature of providing specific numbers, other apps I have tried have limits to this feature. The recipes are great too with the exception of not having serving size. I have read the comments provided by MyFitness Pal regarding this issue. It’s slightly inconvenient but not enough to not use the recipe feature. The only critique I would have is the accessibility to modify your daily defaults goals. Such changing your workout days to adjust macros. This requires going through multiple steps with your profile. It would be great if it would be more accessible, such as at the bottom of the diary. Otherwise I absolutely love this app!!I only use the free version so I can not speak on the premium experience, but I love the free version. I mostly use it for tracking food and it’s really easy to use, for most food I just scan the barcode on the bag/box. It also has a lot of foods from popular restaurants too so you don’t have to construct a meal from each individual ingredient. You can check a breakdown of micro and macro nutrients throughout the day, and on your homepage it tells you how far you are from your calorie goal. There’s a lot of other features for free too I just don’t use them as much. The app is great for beginners or someone advanced who wants to record every single thing you do in a day.After losing 20 pounds I hit a plateau. I was frustrated and couldn’t figure out why I stopped losing weight, I was tracking my steps, fasting, and made healthier choices with my diet. 

This app saved me, I’ve lost 15 pounds with it so far and it helps keep me motivated to lose more. 

I love that it shows you your daily nutrients, encourages you to meet your goals (now I’m focused on a high protein/fiber and low fat diet, which is the only thing that keeps me FULL. I knew I needed more fiber but I never realized how important protein is for your body and keeping you stuffed and energized. It also helps you realize what you’re missing in your diet (I found out I was low on vitamin C, iron and calcium) 

It also keeps me strong with sugar, encouraging me to stay in my limits and if I pass it one day I’m more motivated to make healthier choices the next day.

There are so many other great features that I can’t list because I could go on all day, it’s just that great.

Just download it! You won’t regret it 💕 I also recommend the “Pacer” app if you’re dead set on shedding some weight. Track your steps and eat clean 🧼 💛 good luck peopleNot only is the app well worth the money—especially if you’re keeping track of macros, but the customer service is outstanding. I had an issue where I couldn’t access my account and was forced to create a new one and in turn losing all of my tracking info, but also access to my premium account. Not only did they help me with the issue by looking for my original account and giving me the information that I needed, but they also helped me update my account on their end and got me my premium access back. Just for the fact that there is people willing to actually help customers resolve an issue, makes this app 100% worth it to me.My fitness pal is a very good app for tracking food and activity whether you are trying to loose weight, maintain weight or gain weight. Logging your food and activities is simple especially when you have been doing it for awhile because it builds a list of your commonly used items. Overall a great app. I have used both the free app and the premium version and both work well depending on what you need.  I recently started tracking macros and wanted to be able to change the goals and I believe you can only do that with the paid version. Whenever I need to loose weight I have found that the only way I can do it is by tracking what I eat and this app is always what I use!it’s all free, there are a ton of meals and foods that are already accessible without you having to put any nutrition info into it. it’s a helpful app because it makes tracking your meals easy. they help you lose/gain weight and you don’t have to pay a dime. of course, if you’d like a more in depth experience you can pay for that. everything you 100% need is already in the app for free. the only issue is that the layout is a bit cluttered, i’ll still rate it 5 stars because the app is phenomenal. 10/10 recommend. they also have the option to turn on notifications so you never forget to track your meals.I've been dreading this aspect of my workout knowing it's a ""key"" to achieving results. After reviewing other calorie counter apps, I decided on this and have been using it for 3 days. I like creating meals (i.e. breakdown of calories per ingredients), tracking food by scanning an item's barcode and adjusting portion sizes. It's great in understanding my eating habits.

An opportunity for the developers: beverages. Other then water, there should be a section counting calories via liquids (i.e. soda, protein shakes, etc.). I understand adding to a meal, but I consider them separate- especially on days where I can't get a meal in due to work. This would aid in my accuracy of calorie counting.This app is great! It has a lot of cool stuff to keep you motivated. It has a little congrats page when you note any weight loss. It shows nutrition information even after you have logged your meal, and some others only show this stuff in the full paid version. All around great app! Plus it does this thing which I’m pretty sure is a glitch, but if you haven’t logged meals in a few days it begins to think of this streak as though you are on track and congratulates you for your streak in logging, fake it til you make it has always worked for me so I’m pleased! Every time I have noticed this I have felt more encouraged to get back on track.I have use this app for the better part of two years or so. And, I have been very pleased with it. Recently, I have been working out more. For my workouts I use an app called “ JEFIT “. It is very good as far as tracking my workouts. I have linked ( My Fitness Pal ) with several other apps.  But none of those are able to track & sync my full exercise regiment and thus an accurate calorie count are always inaccurate.

  I think it would increase accuracy with this two apps linked. I hope that someone from ( My Fitness Pal/ Under Armour ) will reach out in an effort to establish a relationship with "" Jefit "".. 

I hope this link will in a future updateStarted using this app a year or two back. It helped me stay focused on the foods I ate, portion control and exercise output. Honestly, I stepped off track and stopped tracking everything. My weight slowly but surely increased. As often happens, a visit to the docs office set me straight again. Since getting seriously focused on changing my body composition, and losing weight, I've used the app again as a daily guide. In the first 30 days I've lost 13 lbs, and I'm on my way to my goal of losing 50 lbs. Thanks to this app, combined with my new zest for eating and exercising right, I feel better about my health and long term goal of sticking around a little longer!I use it every day. My longest streak was like 1400 days before I missed one. My current streak is 206 days. It’s an automatic habit to weigh and log my food and it’s allowed me to keep off the 40 lbs I lost 7 years ago. I like creating meals that I can log with one touch and it’s easy to create recipes like tuna salad with specific ingredients I like. I’ve labeled my mixing bowls so I know how much my ingredients weigh for a given recipe. I then divide that weight into macros per gram. So if I spoon out 227 grams, I just put 227 servings and it figures the macros for me.
 I do wish they would bring back the ability to share a recipe or meal via messenger, though.I love MyFitnessPal - it makes tracking my food and manage not just calories but the essential carbs, protein and fat ratio so easily.  You can import your favorite recipes and MyFitnessPal also provides great recipes as well.  Their food database is just about endless including many store brands.  When it comes to fitness they also shine here with videos and you can link many of the fitness trackers out there so you are not miss a beat in your fitness quest.  I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to change they lifestyle - because that is what weight loss is all about and MyFitnessPal also provides very informative emails to help you reach your goalsI have followed Brooke Ence for years and she has always shared her fitness journey and how she tracks macros. I had a baby in 2017... at first I couldn’t lose the weight so I started weighing food but I wasn’t tracking. About a year and 3 months ago I made the decision to actually commit to tracking my macros by using this app... it has worked wonders for me when I eat clean and when I’ve chosen to work eat dirty. The app itself has cool features. Scanning items is a life saver and if you flip the phone whilst viewing your diary for the day you can view your macro breakdown. I enjoy this app I’ve looked to use others but have ultimately chosen to just use this app cause it AWESOME!!Update:
I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for nearly 7 years, been through countless updates and changes and my feelings are the same. The food library is very vast and tracking calories and weight loss is easy. Since the Under Armour change, many improvements have been made, offering quick videos or workouts, weight control, and food prep. Also compatibility with virtually every type of exercise tracker. Top rated program with less intrusive adds, for free.

Previous review:
I lost 50 lbs using this app. Better than all of the paid programs and syncs with everything. Can't ask for a better weight control app.This app makes tracking absolutely simple.  Everything is easy to find, user friendly. A couple of things I would like to see in future releases: the ability to create and save foods using items directly from the search bar, so I don’t have to do a bunch of math and spend a lot of time to add together all the macros and nutrients that first time. Also, would like the ability to import exercises from the other UA apps. 

The premium features are well worth upgrading for!

Edit: amazingly enough, I discovered that you CAN do the above mentioned things! Hazaa!! Just took a little more poking around! Now the app is perfect!!This app provides a very easy way to track your intake of food with an amazing database of all foods. It makes you more aware of good choices and helps you maintain calorie threshold goals for weight loss and maintenance. It helps you become more aware of nutritional content and the 3 foods you should avoid be a high food like sugar; fat and sodium. It shows you the benefits of exercise by tracking caloric burning of exercise and providing you with net daily calories. It also features a water tracker. The line charts over time feature is a great one that illustrates your progress. A highly recommended app.As a Certified Personal Trainer and fitness enthusiast myself, I highly recommend MyFitnessPal and getting the premium version as well. Not only is it relatively cheap if you buy their one year subscription, buying the premium has given both my clients and I more of an incentive to track calories consistently. Ever since getting the premium app, it has not only allowed me to get the most out of tracking my macros for the day , but it has encouraged to track my calories on a consistent basis. Overall, 10/10 app. Anyone who gets the app should definitely get the premium on top of it.If you are looking for a fitness tracker app, this is actually one of the best ones. All of the other ones I’ve tried always get me just  b a r e l y  far enough and then ask for my money. Everything you may need is free on this app (there is a premium with a lot of good features as well, but the free version is also amazing), from food and water tracking to fitness tracking and weight tracking. If you have an iPhone, it takes your iPhone steps and automatically puts them on your exercise tracker. Also omg IT CALCULATES CALORIES 😍😍😍😍😍😍 genuinely such a great app 10/10 recommended.

Happy fitness! 🤍🤍🤍I’ve always struggled with weight my whole life, Myfitnesspal gave me the tools I needed to begin to eat properly and healthily and it has changed my life for good. I was using another calorie tracking app (MyPlate) which is also good but not near as streamlined as MFP. This app has helped me keep track of my weight loss over the past year. During may 2020 I was weighing in at about 315 pounds and a whole year later I’m down to 220 pounds, I know that I did all that work but MFP truly helped me track all the nutrients I was getting allowing me to live healthier and eat better throughout my weight loss journey.I really think this is the best app on the market for tracking macronutrients. Very user friendly. I would say over 95 percent of the items I scan are found and directly match the labels. You are able to create recipes too which is nice. You can always find a good article to read as well in the blog portion of the app. Tracking weight and progress is supported by a nice line graph to help visualize progress. Occasional crash but no reason to knock the app for that, all apps crash. I do think adding a calculator to the app would do wonders for those tracking food intake very specifically. Is that something that will ever happen?I used this app in college (2010ish) to keep track of my calories. I really needed to track my food, some days I ate too little, some days too much, most days my eating was not on a good schedule. It was easy, I love the barcode feature!!! being able to enter meals that are repeated often, as well as being able to search foods from restaurants is just a few of the amazing ways this app helps track. 
Now, I need to do the same but am also tracking my carb/fat/protein ratio overall and per meal. The app makes it a breeze! I highly recommend.A friend of mine recommended this app to me about 4 years ago and I began using the free version of it to track my calories. I lost over 40 pounds in less than 6 months. Foolishly I thought that I was cured of my bad eating habits and I quit using MyFitnessPal. Now years later I not only gained back all that I lost I added about 30 more pounds to that. I finally realized that tracking what you eat and tracking your exercise and setting goals is the key component to success. It makes you more conscious of your decisions and you find yourself making better choices.I have used fitness pal successfully a couple years ago and trying to replicate that success.  They have so many foods already in there data base that tracking is easy.  Calories in vs calories out isn’t magic ; it is great guidance even if not perfectly tracked.  It also helps keep me accountable for my choices and decide if I want to work hard enough to eat that extra cookie (or whatever) or if something would put me way out of line. Haven’t really utilized everything my fitness pal offers but appreciate the help it gives me.This app is undefeated when it comes to calorie tracking, there is one thing I believe would make this the ultimate nutritional app: Food Intake Calculating. 

I imagined it as a premium feature, where you can choose a set amount of days wether they be in succession or handpicked individually, and you then put in all the foods you want to eat, and the app then tells you how many servings you need to eat to reach your macros and micros properly. Give it a percentage slider similar to the macros, for example I’d enter “45% ribeye steak” then boom I know I have to eat about 6 ounces of it for the 4 days I set it for.I gained weight recently and that was while I was already trying to lose weight. I am horrible at exercising and I needed to figure something out. Someone suggested that I start food tracking. I downloaded this app and started tracking everything that I eat. Because of this app, I was able to see exactly where I was going wrong. It took me a few days to be able to get under my calories but once I did, I’ve been able to stay under them every day. I’ve lost 6 pounds in nine days. I don’t know if I will use this app forever but I will be using it for a long time.I really enjoy the app. It’s helped me lose over 50 pounds. My goal was to diet in the way I plan to go on after the diet. Having a breakdown of carbs, fats, and proteins makes that easy to do. So once I hit my goal weight, all I have to do is up my calories yet stay on the same targets for those carbs, fats, and proteins. Using this app in conjunction with a walking app that tracks, my mileage has made all the difference. I’ve also been tracking my sodium and sugar intake which was shockingly high when I started.  

My Fitness Pal had made it all easy at my fingertips!My Fitness Pal food and exercise tracking app has all that you need for any way of eating. With the ability to break down macros, take progress photos and the huge library of verified nutritional facts on food we eat every day. Another cool option is the ability to add recipes including the Chipotle Bowl you order every time or a favorite recipe you food in a cookbook. The scanner option is a big time saver. MFP also tracks steps as long as you have the phone with you. 9/10 highly recommend.  Thank you My Fitness Pal for making food tracking as painless as possible.I’ve been using this consistently since April 9th and I’ve lost 15lbs in a month! It has 99% of the food I scan in the database, and most exercises though I do have to create some. It super useful for tracking your macros as well and warns you when you’re in danger of eating too much sugar, sodium, or fat. It has helpful articles regularly, as well as recipes. I love the Twitter/Facebook vibe it gives you on the main page as well. Overall this app is AMAZING, for real. I could never be as successfully heathy and excited to be so, without this app. Thank you very much to the creators! 5 out of 5 from me.I love how I can set my calories and it lets me know when I’m over or under. 

Calorie counting is important to me and I never knew how many calories I was consuming until I started tracking it. Just do it. It helped me to decide not to have the snack or dessert if I was already close to my calorie goal for the day and it also allows me to say yes to it if I have been making sure my calories were on point and there is enough room for a treat. This is an awesome helper and you can share with a friend or accountability partner too.It's true what they say, tracking what you eat keeps you mindful. Something so simple but yet effective has helped me get back on track to lose 90+ pounds of weight. It just starts with little changes and then making wiser decisions. This app gives you the power to do that. The reading content is easy to apply immediately to any lifestyle. You don't have to be a gym rat. This is for everyone. The only update I would like to see is a water consumption tracker badge notification on my phone. Their water tracker is just that, but it doesn't remind me or help me drink more water.I have tried various apps over the years, and while all shine at one thing or the other, they are not truly “complete”. This app is - easy to use , has almost ALL foods I have searched for (including south Asian), has a great food scanner and did I mention, it is easy to use .

If there is one item that would make it over the top - is integration of the fitness details. But the reason I am ok, and I give it 5 stars, is because fitness tracking apps are so much more plentiful .

It is an app I would recommend to ANYONE who would want to good app to maintain their diet diary.I have used both MyFitnessPal and MapMyRide for quite a while to help keep me at or below my desired weight.
I track walks and bike rides in one and log food intake in the other.
Logging all the food consumed daily helps you stay in check. It is easy for me to overeat. I’m a big person and I find these apps easy to use to record any exercise or food.
Truly believe they help.
Only minor negative is the GPS tracking varies slightly. I can walk the same 3.0 walk and sometimes it show 2.92 miles, other days 3.08.I have tried at least 4-5 tracking apps and Fitness Pal is the best by far. The catalog of foods listed when you do a search includes a lot more choices than some other apps I’ve tried. I also like that I can get an idea of how many calories came from carbs, protein , etc
I also like that the app is able to sync with my fitness tracker and adjusts my calorie balance accordingly. All this and it’s free to use the basic app- I have suggested it to my Facebook groups, etc many timesThe free version of this app is very helpful and easy to use. It has really helped me stay organized and on track when I’ve used it. I’ve been using this app on and off for the last few years and have only run into 2-3 minor problems (such as a barcode not being recognized or nutrition info being incorrect for certain vitamins) I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of starting a healthy diet and would like help organizing/ tracking calories and nutrients.Different experts say don’t weight yourself every day. It helps me. I know my weight can vary up to 2 pounds but when you watch the graph consistently drop you know you are doing something right. For seniors, tracking protein is essential as we generally do not eat enough protein on a daily basis. It’s been 5 months and I’ve lost 22 pounds and I’m 73. Slow and steady keeps the weight off. And yes I have occasional goodies. It’s just not part of my daily life. It’s how I plan to stay healthy for the rest of my life.You don’t even have to have the full version to enjoy this app, I mean sure it’s nice to have the full version but it’s not one of those apps that has annoying ads you have to close out of. Super nice and super easy to use. I use it everyday. My favorite feature is how it tells you your predicted weight loss like, “If every day were like today, in 5 weeks you’d be about _____.” Makes me stay on track 💜 I’ve lost 30+ pounds just by tracking by calories and exercise on this appGreat app! Love the barcode scan feature and the meal creation option. Makes tracking super easy! I wasn’t sure where to start when I began tracking my health. Downloaded 3-4 apps to do trials and after a few days, gravitated to this one due to how quickly I could enter information. Haven’t upgraded to the full version yet. Meets my basic needs for the moment. Couldn’t believe how fast my calories racked up! Made some very intentional changes quickly after I saw my daily consumption.This app had helped me to lose 100 lbs once! It’s brilliant and the database is the best I’ve found in order to quickly and accurately track food. Now that I’m diving into keto meal planning , I hope the development team can put the following into play - 1) net carb tracking [carbs - (fiber + sugar alcohols)] 2) sugar alcohols as a diary item to chart 3) one time purchases for some of the premium options so not all items are  attached to the subscription option. I’d be willing to pay for some add ons vs paying monthly to unlock all options temporarily.I'm not much for calorie counting. I actually think it'd ridiculous. As long as you're eating real food you're fine. However, this is AMAZING for being self aware. I exercise about 4 times a week and then I eat in excess. This just helps me to understand how much food I am putting in my body. Most times I cook and eat without thinking about how many ingredients there are, or how many crackers are in a serving. I love this app. And I love tracking my exercise and feeling good about the fact that I can eat more. :-) I have recommended this app to ALL of my friends.EASY TO USE !!!! FUN !!!! 
Excellent comprehensive app that personally addresses ones goals toward Weight lose while keeping your strength from every significant aspect—  from food meal plans ( if u wish ) exercise -water - consumption - food tracking - total calories per day - based on your goals - in your time frame - the user sets the goals - 
Progress charts - it has every aspect to be successful and EASY to use !
In four days I have experienced progress towards MY goal - 
My Fitness Pal is a safe knowledgeable method! I recommend it !So simple and easy to use yet all the information you could need to keep track of what you’re putting in your body. Recently used items makes tracking familiar items a breeze and the database is extremely large so you’ll always find what you’re looking for. In the rare case you can’t, making the item yourself is easy enough. Customizing your goal is also easy and it allowed you to adjust macros to what you want within your calorie goal.This app has helped me lose 50lbs in 6 months the first time  (pre-pandemic) and unfortunately I fell into bad habits, stopped tracking calories and gained it back. Now post pandemic I have lost 30lbs in 5 months using this app to track my calories, nutrition, and exercise. I love that you can save your meals you eat frequently to make logging your daily intake so much easier. It truly is a game changer for losing weight and I plan to continue for maintenance this time around as well!Updating my rating from 1 to 5. I am now able to login. I will say it again this app was and is key to me losing weight by tracking food and calories.  I dont track macros but if i decide to this app will be how i do it. 

Previous review: I used this for years and it was key to helping me lose weight.  I now cant login on my phone app.  I can login fine on a laptop. I dont want to reseach how to login on my phone when it was seamless for years. I started using the fitbit app to log foodI have had this app for around 4 years.. it helped me lose 20 pounds with the help of its calorie and macro tracking system that has been directly sent to earth from the gods themselves. If you buy a 10 food scales at Walmart it makes the system even easier and more accurate. Then fact that you can scan barcodes and immediately have all information uploaded to your food diary is a god send. Don’t take this app for granted, it is everything you could ever need in diet tracking alone plus multiple other amenities!Seriously this app changed my life! Just paying attention to what I eat and tracking everything makes me feel in control and has helped me lose over 30 pounds. You just have to stay consistent and it will help you! I don’t do any of the social part of the app but my dad does and he loves it, I’m a more private person so I just keep it to myself. This app is super user friendly and helpful, I put all my meals in here and it makes it super easy to stay on track with my macronutrients.I’ve always had issues with my weight fluctuating, dieting, binging, repeat. 165lbs<->230lbs. I also have a neurological disorder that benefits from nutritional ketosis. It's just nearly impossible for me to keep track in my head with everything else going on in my life. MyFitnessPal makes tracking calorie intake and net carbs so easy that I actually keep up with logging.

Yes, we know, but it still doesn’t change the fact that the barcode scanner was always included in the free version of the app. After deleting MFP I downloaded Cronometer which INCLUDES the barcode scanner in the free version, and less intrusive ads. After using their Free Version with barcode scanning I’m happy to support them with my purchase of the annual premium membership for a fraction of the MFP price. - Thanks

*Original Review*
Circled back to MFP after over a year of not using it to help with my 2023 fitness goals. I opened the app to immediately be bombarded with an ad to purchase premium. I have had Premium in the past and it was great for macro tracking, however I wanted to get back in the swing of things before committing again, especially with how expensive it is now. I bypassed the ad and tried to use the barcode scanner to log my first meal and found out it requires you to pay. A free feature that was long time included is now being used as leverage for you to purchase premium, and that’s incredibly disappointing. It really shows you what MFP thinks about the consumer. This turned me off entirely and I will not be purchasing the yearly subscription that I planned on. App deleted.I’ve been using the app for several years, and today would be 342 days in a row. There is a bug in using the iPad version that has never been fixed. The bug is that the feature in the iPhone version to check Remaining vs Goals (Calories, Carbs (g), Fat (g), Protein (g), Sodium (mg), Sugars (g) ) DOES NOT WORK. IN THE iPad version. Therefore I have to enter on the iPhone and can only look at the iPhone to see where I’m at later in the day. There is another bug in both versions, and that has been present ever since the new dashboard. I like to give and get encouragement from friends, but when I get encouragement it takes WEEKS for it to show. Today (Jul 2) the notification bell had red flags and that was to notify me that a friend liked and commented on something from May 16. This (delayed notifications) has been going on for weeks. Lastly the newsfeed is all old news. “These New Habits Are Here To Stay” is a joke. The newsfeed is the same for months. I guess that’s what’s meant by part of that headline. The same “… Here To Stay”. The thing is it’s no longer “News”. Rename it “Oldsfeed” or “Backstories”. I don’t think the Premium subscription has any value anymore. DissatisfiedI’ve been using MFP for a number of years. I did pay for premium this year against my better judgment, because it’s absurdly expensive, so I can’t speak to the ads but I believe it without question. I felt like I needed a boost toward my goals so I took that plunge. But once I got the email about putting the barcode scanner behind a paywall, I was so disgusted with that corporate greed money grab that I cancelled the auto renewal and immediately signed back up with an app I used before, which is a fraction of the price, much better functionality, and much more user-friendly. MFP got the remainder of my year’s subscription money, so of course they’re thrilled, but lost a customer for good. I just didn’t want to use this app anymore.  And happily, I found something that works much better because of it.  

Ironically, the barcode scanner works for me maybe 25% of the time now. It either doesn’t recognize common foods at all, or comes up with unrelated foods, or nutritional stats are way off. I thought it was due to having an old iPhone 7, but when I joined the new app, every food so far has scanned perfectly and accurately.

Best of luck to all.Update: just switched to Lose It, which has all the features I need and a more intuitive interface for a more reasonable subscription fee.

As others have mentioned, MFP’s new layout requires more clicks and scrolling to do basic things like track your weight. I don't see the point of the new dashboard if it doesn't load all the panels until a significant delay, which is probably to give loading priority to the ads. And the ads are over the top now. Full-screen takeovers? Seriously? Is anyone even clicking them intentionally? I get that this is a free app, but the price jump to premium is disproportionate to my needs. I actually tried premium for a while and found I didn't use most of the features. Have you guys considered a basic subscription that's just like the free version of the app but without ads at a lower cost? Because there are likely a lot of members like me who don't track macros or need day-specific goals, and $80-$240 a year just to count calories and track weight is a bite too big to swallow when there are other services that do this (better, I’m discovering) for less.The newest change has got me looking elsewhere. I have used MyFitnessPal for over 6 years (have a streak of logging for 2373 days) I have seen lots of changes to the app over the years, but most recent all the push to “premium” and all the ads. I don’t mind having to scroll through ads knowing its free but when you start eliminating things that were in the free version that bugs me. Starting November 1, they will only store information for 2 years unless you are a premium member. I really enjoyed being able to look back at my progress and see trends (good and bad) with my health/fitness goals. Now if I want to keep that I have to pay for it. This was a no-nonsense easy way to track food/exercise that I would rave about to others. Not anymore as they have jumped in on the “profit first” instead of working towards general well-being for others. So bummed to see such a simple to use app change so much and become so commercialized. Keep looking if you are looking for a basic food/activity tracker for free. This one will hook you then make you pay...not worth it anymore.Update: Do yourself a favor download LOSEIT. 
Tried to use the barcode scanner and now it’s a subscription feature. Very poor move. I decided to eat the same things I’ve already tracked which, thankfully are saved. Very poor choice. And this is from a former subscriber. I will look for an alternative or just enter data manually. If they change that ability I’ll just scrap. I got this app when I was trying to lose 20lbs to satisfy my doctor. I lost 20lbs and continued on with a friend and lose over 50lbs. I'm currently 158 and 9% body fat. I have been conditioned to log every meal and it workout. It's easy because it works seamlessly wit UARecord. This app not only helped me meet my goal but when I continued to move the goal post I met those goals too. I still use the app and since it also includes many popular restaurants it makes it easy to eat out. I purchased a food scale which, for me, was instrumental in achieving my goals. For all those attempting to lose weight this is the app for you.I have used MFP for years, on and off depending on my fitness goals. Banner ads were always okay, as they kept the app free. Now ads will engulf the entire screen, usually while you’re in the middle of inputing your food, forcing you to pause what you’re doing, and wait for the ad to allow you to close it. With busy lifestyles, you can no longer quickly input meals as the ads are sneakily placed at the most inconvenient times. 

I was annoyed, but pushed through because food I have had logged for months and years on end are saved to the app; however, with the recent news that the barcode feature is being limited to premium members only, I will no longer be using this app. 

The app’s library of foods seldom finds the specific food that I am looking for and scanning barcodes is the one, secure way to know you are adding the correct food with the right calorie and nutrition information. This free app is now useless.I am growing increasingly frustrated by the fact that this application changes my target weight loss goals PERMANENTLY if I  tweak my current weight, my goals, or my weekly weight loss goals even slightly just to look at hypotheticals. And when I change the settings back to where I started, the app doesn’t change the weight loss targets back to what it was before I started tweaking. This randomness makes me incredibly frustrated and makes me want to not use this app anymore. I thought it was just coincidental the first time it happened, but now I realize I can’t do any hypothetical changes without it becoming permanent. Just today I tried a hypothetical and my daily calorie goal changed from 1690 to 1210 and I can’t change it back no matter what I enter. This is ridiculous. The makers of this app don’t realize how much that daily target goal changes my life, and messing with it like this is incredibly demoralizing, illogical, and quite frankly dangerous.ive used this app since highschool. loved it a lot. now that i'm an adult i probably would have bought a premium membership for macros alone but it being $20/month and randomly making the best feature of this app (barcode scan) premium is just scummy to me. everyone i talked to who uses this app did use it for quick scans- so it's useless to them now because $20/month is more than most subscriptions with actual content included-not worth for scanning when other apps will let you do it for free. gotta agree with them and will find something better; it's just upsetting to have to lose years of progress but i guess it'll be a new journey to document anyway. good luck with your goals everyone-but find a better app for it 💕✨

update to developers response: saying you can still log your food manually kinda just makes you seem like you're calling the customer stupid for your mistakes. obviously we know we can log the food manually. but you're right, not only was it convenient it was why most people even used your app. especially after you've made it so ugly the last few years all we really had is the barcode scan. thanks for not caring about most ppls responses though~helps get people get off this app faster! (:I’ve used this app on and off for the past 5 years, they continually take away features that used to be free and put them behind a paywall. Rather than making the membership better, they take features away to from the free version in order to make paying more desirable.  They recently took the barcode scan option away from the free version. I understand I am using the free version( I pay through all the adds I have to watch), but it just feels wrong to have it be free then start charging. For this reason I will be seeking to use another app.  

Another frustrating aspect of this app, when you update your weight you have to go back and fix you calories and macro goals.  It always puts me at 50% carbs as a default rather than saving the percentage I set. Frustrating and I’m sure easily fixed.For years this has been my go-to app to track my fitness goals. (I was loyal to this app starting in 2012 until the present). I have recommended this app to many friends over the years. However, I think one of the worst decisions this app made was to make users pay to use the barcode feature. Not only that but to also make the cost of using premium features so high. This decision has forced me to end my loyalty with this app. After over a decade of use, it’s time for me to move on with a different app that isn’t as money driven as this one has become. Also, I paid for the premium version on the new app. It was nearly half the price! I really hope this app learns from this but I find it unlikely. It’s very disappointing. Evidently this has become an app for people far more financially privileged than me. Good luck with that.I’m so frustrated! Several years ago I successfully lost 70 lbs with the help of MFP. Currently, life (and covid) being what it is, I have gained some weight and of course turned to MFP for the same excellent help. 

I cannot get in. Period. Cannot. It allows me to “log in”, but then asks some questions to enhance the experience (presumably since it’s been awhile for me) how much do I weigh, my goals etc.  Then it wants my email. I enter and it’s rejected as invalid. I try several times. No luck. I start over and try the reset password option to verify I’m using the email I had on file before. It instantly sends me a reset email, to THE SAME EMAIL it refuses to accept as valid for me.  Any attempts to contact support also result in a “invalid email” response. I have no idea what to do. I had a lot of saved meals etc in the program so I don’t want to start completely over. I’m so frustrated. :(They got rid of the barcode scanner!?! That got me to switch to another app And not look back.  This app has gotten worse and worse over the years. I’ve used it for almost 10 years and have been considering switching and ended up doing so after the last update. They keep taking away features which were free, to push their ridiculously expensive subscription of $20/mo or $80/yr. I switched to lose it. It’s free options are awesome. Solid interface. And best of all it has a FREE barcode scanner. Also $20/year if you want to be able to get very granular with your goals/inputs. Completely worth it, but does take a little time to get used to the GUI.

Update: the links the devs post in response don’t even load 😂 yikes. After many years and frequent recent disappointment from them I’m not even surprisedNot sure if it’s only a problem with FitBit users, or non-premium members, but MyFitnessPal is ALWAYS missing my FitBt steps. Considering I wanted to used this app to track my health and walking is a big part of my daily health goals, having this miss my steps throws off my goals. Although I can still track what I eat and MANUALLY enter my calories burned through exercise, it’s been such a hassle to go onto the MyFitnessPal website, disconnect my FitBit, reconnect it, and re-sync it in the app. I’ve done it twice just this last week and today it won’t even update my steps. It’s been an ongoing problem for this app with many users for at least over a year and still hasn’t been resolved. There have been many updates to the app but this seems to have not been prioritized. I will likely just stop using this app, it’s just not worth the trouble.Edit: the devs keep responding with a link to “learn more” about the decision to move barcode scanning to premium. All it says is that it was a hard decision and it’s so that they can make new features, but doesn’t say anything about what features. I’m assuming the new features are a salary hike for executives. 

MFP used to be great but they keep taking away features and making them premium only. Why does a barcode scanner need to be a paid feature? You can’t track macros for free, you can’t do most customized goals for free, now you can’t even barcode scan for free. Oh! But they’ll give you a 50% discount so you only pay $40 a year instead of $80 a year for premium! Yeah I’m not paying almost the same price as I do for Disney+ just so I can use basic features. I’ll just go to one of the other free apps.I thought it was just my phone or the app downloaded incorrectly. I was wrong. I’ve tried to save recipes into my food log and it just says “cannot connect to server - saved locally”. Then I look for said recipe and it’s no where to be found. Two days later it appears and I can log it. Why bother logging it two days later? 
My second gripe is the macros. I have subscribed to the paid version. Now I’m tired of using it. The app adjust my macros every single time I change it. I don’t know if it just doesn’t understand that I don’t want to change my macros to where I’m eating 80g of protein a day. I’m lifting you piece of garbage! How is that conducive of MY GOALS! I’m tired of under armor products in general.
Don’t download unless you’re a drone that can’t do anything unless a computer tells you or you’re trying to look like a vegan hipster sissy.The app has the wrong information for your calories and macros. I just noticed yesterday that my macros did not look like I hit my goal for the day. But the app said I was over on my calorie goal. So I decided to check myself. Carbs and protein count as 4 calories per gram and fats count as 9 calories per gram. If you check your numbers at the end of the day on the app, it is wrong. In my case, I was short about 130 calories. I addressed this with tech help, and they blamed it on the user error of people entering wrong macro and calorie info. This is incorrect and laziness on tech help’s part. I am canceling my subscription and will not pay for an app that does not do what it is advertised to do. I would not recommend this app if you are serious about your diet and nutrition goals. The margin of error is too high to reach your nutrient goals successfully.Knocked off a star for not interfacing with Apple Health for water tracking because I use a hydration tracking app that doesn’t pair with MFP (WaterLlama) and for not allowing for tracking of Vitamin B12. Also, I hate that the vitamins and minerals are in percentages causing me to reverse calculate as men and women have different iron goals and so do pregnant women. 

Been a premium member of LoseIt for over a decade and finally made the switch since they still haven’t allowed for added sugar and iron tracking. However, LoseIt does allow for water tracking via AppleHealth and their insights, meal planning features, and overall app layout and aesthetic are better for me.

Edit: Oh noooo, MFP also doesn’t track added sugar, not sure why the article I read said that did. Fooducate does but that app is super clunky. I’m at a loss.Some things you can avoid with inflation. This is definitely one of them.  It's one thing when you add features for people to pay for, but another thing when you now charge for what used to be free.  And the fee is a lot for what little value you get. If you made it to where you pay one lifetime fee, then I'm sure the feedback wouldn't be so harsh, but $20/mo or $100/year is overkill.  along with trying to make the app more like Facebook, which is also backwards because those kind of apps are exactly why a lot of people are too distracted to reach their health goals.  Your goal may be more money, but I refuse to take part in it.  There are other great apps out there that I would gladly give money too just because they don't operate how you all decided to.I’ve been using this app (free version) for over a year.  I logged in this evening and it seems everything is locked and now required to purchase the premium to see… including time of meals, breakdown of macros, percentages, over all calories, breakdown of calories per meal towards daily goals, etc.  I have loved using this app… now it’s frustrating. I understand paying premium for all the additional meal plans, exercise plans, access to all the community, etc. But it appears that the only thing the app is good for now is to figure out the calorie count since I can’t access anything else. This is so disappointing… And frustrating! 5 stars this entire year… now a 1 as I cannot use the app as I have been unless I’m willing to spend money.  I do not understand this!!I’ve been using MFP for years, it has helped me with my fitness goals and achieving the body that I always wanted. I am extremely disappointed that they are taking away the only feature that makes the app convenient. The barcode scanner has been available since the beginning and they are just taking it away because they want more $$$. Instead of adding new and better features to entice me into buying a premium membership they decided the best move was to take away one we already had. Don’t even get me started on the scammy ads that show up every time you log a food. I can’t imagine dealing with ads AND having to manually look up every little thing I eat. Do not give these lazy, money hungry idiots your time.I have this thing glitching on me regularly. Copying food from one date to the next is spotty at best, I can try 5 times and not have it work at all.
Then the calorie goals are only accurate for a little while and you eventually will not lose anything following their goal calories but rather will have to be hundreds lower than their goal in order to lose. I confirmed this at other websites where I tap in my info and their calorie goals work… because they’re hundreds less than this app. So don’t follow the numbers and you’ll be better off, but then thats the biggest reason to use this app, so that makes it incredibly pointless. Id look for another app or disregard the calorie goals as soon ad you’ve lost a handful of pounds.I just upgraded to Premium. It has potential but its unreliability automatically gives it a 0/5; this release is pathetically buggy. My biggest annoyance is that the macro computation on the “Macronutrient Dashboard” is unreliable. Macros per meal are computed correctly in your diary but for some reason it can’t then (1) add macros from all your meals together, (2) subtract them from your daily goals, (3) display the remaining macros up on top on your Dashboard. I have no idea what it’s computing but every single category is wrong 100% of the time: net carbs, fat, and protein. What’s the point of promoting Custom Dashboard as a premium feature when it can’t do this very basic thing correctly and it forces you to do it by hand or risk everyday or risk missing your goals.I used myfitnesspal off and on since 2014 and the recent months have tarnished my opinion of their practice. I used to recommend this app to anyone pursuing various health/fitness goals. 
However, greed has finally taken over, as basic fundamental features are being placed behind a subscription paywall. All this comes after adding in obtrusive ads. I can roll with the punches, sure you need to make money off of your users. However, you seriously need to reconsider your cost for the premium plan if you expect people to buy in. 
Time to test drive other apps or I’ll go back to my manual spreadsheet tracking.

By setting reachable weight goals, eating a whole food plant diet, exercising  (mostly swimming, walking, Pilates, stretching), I am much healthier than I have ever been. 
I take risks with new restaurants occasionally, always requesting the sauces on the side due to salt restriction.  I also have had to reduce protein, while most people do the opposite, due to the kidney issue.  The latest addition of recording fasts manually is a great addition. I enjoy this app and though customer service has slacked considerably since I first bought it, and I wish more food ingredients were available to check, it still records the major ingredients that I need to keep healthy kidneys while losing weight.If I am paying a premium subscription fee for a service, then that’s exactly what I expect to get.. a service. Meaning I would like recommendations and a layout built for me to help lead me in the right direction of the types of meals that I should eat to reach the goals I have selected. This app is essentially nothing more than having a diary and keeping track of food you eat... for almost $80 a year. Lol, It seems like I may be the only one who finds that hilarious, but I can easily do that myself with a pen and paper and not have to spend any money at all.

I wasn’t interested in any of the paid features and wouldn’t have really used them, not to mention I couldn’t really afford it, so I stuck to the free version and it worked great for me. I lost 30+ lbs from February - August of this year using the app to track my calories and protein. I chose to continue to use the app even after I reached my weight loss goals to maintain my weight and track my progress photos since I often lift weights. I am extremely disappointed to find that they took away the barcode scanner for tracking food from the free version and moved it to the paid version of the app. I used that feature DAILY to track my meals and now I either have to deal with the inconvenience or stop using the app altogether, since I refuse to pay $20/ month to simply be able to scan my barcodes. This was a key feature in my success with this app because I could quickly track my meals when I was working / busy/ etc. If there was even a smaller one time fee to get this one feature back , I would gladly pay it. I will not pay a $20 subscription fee for this. It took away the convenience and ease of use for me and I think it might be time to move on to a different app.I gave it two stars because I wanted to at least acknowledge what I did like about the application. The only thing I like is the integration with Garmin.

Now to the frustrating part. The purpose of checking this application out and going premium was because the previous app I could only set macros one day at a time. Carb cycling and adjusting daily i was looking for an easier way to set it and forget it.  I went in and customized the daily macro goals for each day of the week and thought this is exactly what I wanted. The next day I look at my dashboard on the app and it has some crazy numbers that were not part of the baseline goal or adjusted goals for the different carb days. The dashboard on the actual website itself in the summary mirrors those crazy macro numbers but when I go to the goals they are all set and reflect the intended goal. Today alone, without me adjusting the dashboard has changed numbers 3 times. 

I tried to take the easy route away from a dependable app that I had to adjust once daily to now paying way more money for an application that is pulling numbers from who knows where. The most recent adjustment has me eating 4707 calories when in the goals it reflects 2568.  Worst decision made at this point in terms of tracking apps.I’ve used this app for many years, my login streak was 2544 days. Back when it was owned by Under Armour it was a great tool for working on one’s health and fitness goals. They added premium features, which I think is great. If someone wants those added tools, it’s awesome to have them available for a small fee. Then came the ads. More started popping up in the app. Banner ads at first, then I was getting a full screen ad after almost everything I did. I get it, it’s a free app. But that’s what premium subscriptions are for. But while the ads got very annoying, they were tolerable. However, then they removed the barcode scanner and put it behind the paywall. This had been a free feature for years, and a feature other apps offer for free. I don’t have long lunch breaks, so scanning barcode made it easy for me to track my intake. Searching through lists of entries for the right one made tracking much more tedious. As much as I loved the app and was faithful for so many years, even urging friends and coworkers to use it, I’m now testing other apps. They took a once great tool and made it tedious to use unless you can afford to be a paid member. Eating healthy is already pricey enough, without adding an extra monthly fee just to track it.I diligently track my macros everyday (which is why I have subscribed to the premium version of this app), and I’ve recently decided (with the guidance of my nutritionist) to change the amount of protein, carbs, and fat I have. When I make these changes, the app auto-adjusts the total of amount of calories that I “should” have daily. But listen here - no one asked for this! I certainly didn’t!!! I should be able to say how many calories, and how many grams of protein/fat/carbs I want without the app stopping me from doing both. As it stands now, I can only do one or the other, which makes no sense. I get that MFP most likely has medical professionals on their team helping to create the suggested macro/calorie breakdowns; but again - I’m not looking for this one-size-fits-all mess. I’m on a serious weight loss journey (down 138lbs, with 60lbs+ left to drop), and I’ve got goals to meet. Please consider disabling this unnecessary function. If I’m paying $50 a year, this entire setup should be customizable. I’d rather not use a different app, because y’all have the best bank of foods to log for tracking, but I’m not planning to continue paying for something that doesn’t meet my needs.The app is easy to use and helps you understand your eating habit that can sabotage your health goals. I only use the free version because it has just enough goodies to make it easy and I have actually shared with everyone who asked me how I did it. The “it” is 100 lbs lost! Unfortunately a lot of the help came from the barcode scanning feature. Now you can only use this to once free feature through a paid subscription which doesn’t add much. Taking this free feature away gives me hesitation now. Still use the app but obviously looking for the next version to either revert back to free scanning or time for another app. Aside from that, many who struggle with weight loss, mainly struggle keeping accountability of calories because they feel ashamed. Having a scanning feature, allows the a user to quickly scan and get over that hump, moving forward and improving each day. My sincere hope is that MyFitnessPal reconsiders the feature and once more offer it for free to truly be a “pal” to those in need of one for their fitness goals.I always loved this app for its inclusivity and approachability in support to achieve my fitness goals. The best part was that you didn’t have to be a premium member to have access to all the resources this app has to offer. However, this creators of My Fitness Pal begun to strip our resources away by putting them in the premium section. An example of this is the barcode scanning that helps you find out the nutritional value of almost any item. This used to be accessible to all of its users and it was a valuable tool. Now that it’s been pushed into the premium section, I can only assume that the creators have begun to value profit more than the success of their customers in their fitness journey. Any successful marketing for an app likely advertises new resources and incentives for upgrading to a premium subscription, but taking away existing resources and placing them into the premium category only drives people to assume the app is money hungry and doesn’t actually care about its users. If My Fitness Pal has declined into a simple money hungry calorie calculator, I will be deleting.So I love this app actually don’t let the rating fool you. Logging foods is the best on this app compared to ANY other out there, setting goals, creating recipes that’s all great!
But what is really REALLY irking me is the fact that I just bought my Apple Watch thinking it would integrate very well into it and it does not. It’s supposed to, but it doesn’t display my nutrients remaining on the opening of the app, just a bunch of blank categories. I try to add a 20 oz water I drank on my watch and it doesn’t work at all. I’ve reinstalled and updated the app and nothing helps and really it’s a big deal for me because I’m a professional athlete. My diet is everything and anything that makes it a bit easier is great for me. This app needs an update and it will be 5 stars, but as of now, on my up to date iPhone Xmax with Apple Watch series 6, it is absolutely irksome to have the issues I’m having. 
Call it first world problems, but I’m bothered by it. 
Like I said this app is SOOOOOOO amazing! Please use the app! But I need the developers to FIX THIS PROBLEM I’m having PLEASE!Many years ago my wife and I praised this app as a secret sauce for dropping weight and getting in shape. I’d even say that MFP did more for the overall health of the world population than the Presidential Fitness program of the 1970’s with youth.

We soon subscribed for the Pro version and paid the hefty but somewhat decent annual price.

But, like many, we slipped away after a few years and canceled the subscription as we felt we had absorbed enough good habits taught and reinforced to us by the app.

Fast forward to today when we are getting back on board. We wanted to first ease into the app again before paying for the Pro version. But the blood sucking corporate mentality yanked away the barcode scan feature and some goals (calories and protein) are reset each day, not saving them. A huge cripple unless you pony up to the Pro.

Not cool brothas. You really did something great on the planet and started to leave it a better place. Something many of us take to heart but only few achieve. Yet, in the name of not merely reasonable profit but more so of greed (probably excusing things with the need to accommodate increasing costs), you are passing over truly helping the vast majority who cannot afford to pay the subscription in addition to the other many costs that are incurred with a healthy lifestyle.

You were on the way to changing the world. But you blew it.I’ve used MFP for over ten years. It is a great way to hold hit your health and fitness goals. Even with the free version, you are able to track calories, exercise, progress, etc. It has an enormous database of different foods that makes this process relatively easy, once you get the hang of it. You can track progress through weight or progress pictures. You can interact with others and use friends to hold yourself accountable. There are countless great things about this app. With all that being said, the new update is absolutely horrible. I have been a huge promoter of this app and have recommended it to many friends and family. The new update immediately lags and glitches, even in the Home Screen/dashboard. This has made using the app more trouble than it’s worth. I’m going to be trying out other apps that perform the same function, and I’m hoping MFP can get these glitches under control so I can come back later.I understand the app is free but the problems I see  would still occur in the premium version. I still use it and wonder if the premium version is worth it. It’s not simple to get clear accurate data. Item 1: macros with dodgy food data is rampant. Foods calorie , fat, carb breakdowns are crowd sourced and there are many duplicate inaccurate entries. Trying to compare the entries in the MFP database to actual food labels to find the correct one is time consuming and not always possible. Even verified entries are incorrect if the food label is the golden source. Item 2: the algorithms used for weight loss ( at least on the free version - no idea if premium is different) are way off. The “if every day was like this you’d be blah in 5 weeks” is wrong 100% of the time for me. On the plus side... the app does really help with control, awareness, and keeping focused on long term goals. I’ll still use it despite its functional/data flaws.I have been using MyFitnessPal for several years. It’s been a pretty good app, and until recently the updates kept making it better.

It has been easy to create recipes and meals you make at home and eat on a regular basis. It remembers foods you eat regularly and suggests them to you to enter in the  diary. The best thing for diary entries is being able to see a list of foods you commonly eat at a specific meal and tick off boxes to log common foods quickly with one tap.

Until recently, the interface felt sleek, with all the most common tools right up front where they are easily used every day.

However, the most recent update has changed the diary interface; it feels like it has gone backwards at least five years. Once you get around the much clunkier interface, it doesn’t take long to discover that the developers have removed the simple diary entry for weight tracking, which is likely the main reason the vast majority of people use apps like this. If you want to log your weight it’s now hidden inside the “Goals” menu. It feels like you’re changing your profile when you update your weight, not simply logging a number anymore. It’s hard to find, and a really weird choice.

I’ve been a regular user for a long time, but the newest updates have me looking for a new food diary app.I have used MFP off and on over the years. I always met my goals within a good amount of time. It was easy for me to scan my foods and move on with my day. 
The food data base was vast and mostly accurate. I did find a lot of discrepancies with things like diet juices and different teas, but they weee right on with the calories so I didn’t think it mattered. 
I even tried Premium for a while about 2 years ago, but I couldn’t afford to keep t. 
Today, I wanted to start using it again, to lose 5 lbs before the holidays. 
I was shocked when I had to get my magnifying glasses just to see the screen. I’m far from blind but this is ridiculous. 
I figured it would be okay because I just scan my food and go. Much to my surprise, the scan feature is now a PREMIUM feature. 
We are already dealing with inflation in every part of our lives, and you take something so small and want to charge for it? It’s a calorie counter; there are tons out there. You have taken something great and charged your way out of that title. 
If you wanted to take away the scan feature, you should’ve made the print easier to read. Or even the other way around. 
I’m not sure why you decided to charge for the scanning and I will never see your response as I am deleting the app now. 
Was it worth charging to lose people?I’ve used my fitness pal for years (I think on and off for about 7 total). It’s always had some bugs (randomly quitting, error loading/syncing data, etc.) but I didn’t use premium so I dealt with it just fine. Recently I reactivated the app after not using it for about a month. Upon every single time I opened the app, it would say, “welcome back, please enter your goals” and I’d have to manually re-enter my calories, body metrics, etc goals. Then I’d have to go into my preferences and adjust my general macronutrient preferences. Every single time I opened the app, which was usually about 3x a day (3 meals and then however many snacks I’d have or water input). Seemed like an intentionally obnoxious way to prompt users to pay for premium, which is a great way to get rid of longtime users who have just liked to use it for general dietary tracking for health (I have autoimmune diseases and need the logs for my doctor). What a bummer! Oh well.I’ve been using this app for a few months and it was fine initially. I loved setting food based goals in order to meet my weight goals and the ease of using the app track that. Tracking workouts was also nice despite the fact that the app doesn’t calculate calories burned from anything other than cardio so you have to rely on a fitness watch or another app for logging strength training accurately. There were premium features as to be expected from most apps now and I was fine without those. Taking a pic of a meal and logging it that way was premium,for example. Now you also need premium to simply scan a  barcode and log food items or you have to search and enter them manually which you didn’t have to do the last time I was on the app. It is now virtually useless to me and has been deleted. Capitalism strikes again.I’ve been using this app for nearly 10 years. One of the primary features I used to promote to others in trying to get them to join the app, was the bar scan feature, which has now been taken away for basic users.

I can understand that the Company needs to make more revenue, but I wish they would focus on getting it through additional channels like advertising. For me, that would be preferable rather than requiring users to have a premium account in order to access the core features that originally made the app popular. 

Personally, I would rather watch a short add for 15-30 seconds, than to pay for a premium service. In my opinion, taking away core features like the bar scan, discourages new users from joining, and makes existing users look elsewhere to meet their fitness goals.In the past, I had a lot of success using the free version this app. It used to be really, really great. It really helped me stay on track with my dietary goals. I got to the point that I was easily able to judge my caloric intake and maintained a decent regimen without the consistent use of the app, so I quit using it. Now, I have some new goals and I was looking forward to using MFP again to help me reach them. It is not as user friendly as it used to be. And now the free version no longer includes the barcode scanner which is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. This was the very best of the features. It if were still available in the free version, I could deal with the confusing features of the diary. But now it’s just frustrating so I am deleting MFP and moving on to something better.The layout of things is very crazy in comparison to how it used to feel years ago. When you make a selection in “progress” for what you want to see, you should be defaulted to that until it is changed again - it should not auto default to steps every time.
No predicted timeframe for weight loss goals.
Many foods are marked with the green check mark that are not accurate. Would be nice if there was a database of actually accurate foods from the store and restaurants - I would pay to use that however I refuse to pay to use the scanner that used to be free. In comparison to the free version I used years ago - the app is clunky and crashes a lot and for having paid options, there are no improvements that have been made, you only pay to use items that used to be free…kinda crazy to me.I’ve had this app for probably 5 years. I used to be able to scan barcodes and track things that are blocked without premium now. 
But why would I stump up for premium at $20/month? That’s an insane amount of money for an app that’s buggy and laggy, crashes regularly, bulk add ingredients in My Recipes is useless (a pound of fresh thyme? Really?!?!?)  never remembers my macro goals and constantly reverts to default, and it no longer has the option of a goal date instead of by the week weight loss. 
Forget Keto with this app. You can manually take fiber away from your net carbs but sugar alcohols are behind the paywall, and the percents in your macros will still be off. 
I don’t really feel like getting familiar w a new app but I think it’s time.I’ve had this app for years but am finally to the point where I’m focusing super hard on my weight loss goals. Everything has been great until I received a Fitbit and have been unable to connect it. Initially I reached out to support about a month ago and I haven’t received a response. Every time I go to try and connect my Fitbit on my phone I get stuck in this cycle of trying to log into my account. I’ll log in via Facebook, it’ll flash a screen and take me right back into the Facebook sign in screen again. When I try to log in to Myfitnesspal with my email, it tells me to log in via Facebook. Around and around I go with no resolution. I want to change my review but until they fix this issue, I’m afraid my review will stay the same.I used MyFitnessPal years ago, before Under Armor bought (and apparently now sold) it, to lose a good 50 pounds partially by tracking food. The app was a very useful part of that journey, and once I reached the destination I no longer needed the app and stopped using it.

Fast forward to now, some 7 years later where I’m mostly looking to track macronutrients, I downloaded the app again. Sadly, the app has been so overloaded with ads, popups, and restrictions that it is incredibly difficult to use even the most basic features.

Immediately I took to the internet to see if better options exist (they usually do) and found Cronometer which offers a much more usable experience upon my early assessment. 15 minutes in and I’ve uninstalled MyFitnessPal and deleted my account, mostly since I have no idea who owns it now.

At the end of the day any tools to help you be healthy are good tools—but the easier and less restrictive they are to use, the more likely we are to use them. Sadly, MyFitnessPal has regressed into something that distracts from the real goals of good nutrition, fitness, and overall health.Suddenly the premium (paid) version of the app is buggy. Not sure it’s worth paying for right now. 

For example, when a weekly summary is ready, I tap to go view it, but I’m taken to a web page viewed within the app that wants me to log in. I have no recollection of making a login for this site, and submitting an email for “forgot password” has done nothing. 

Do I have a login I forgot? Do I need to create one? Who knows? I thought Apple was supposed to have an option to be the login option. Where’s that?

The weekly summaries are incredibly useful in the long term allowing users to verify weekly standards that are moving them closer to their goals. Not being able to access this while using the PAID version of the app is a significant quality dent. 

Tapping on Priority Customer Support in the app takes me to an error page. 

Images not loading in the Home screen list of articles. Not tragic, but it’s a bug and makes it less likely for me to browse the page. 

I’ve used and paid for this app happily for a few years now. Hopefully they repair these issues before renewal comes up. Right now it’s sketchy and not what I paid for.I used this app for a few years in and off. I recommended it to friends. It really helped me keep on track. I was considering upgrading to premium for more insight into macros, control of goals, and the ability to export data, but the recent updates have totally put me off. The full page ads randomly interrupting while I am trying to enter data is infuriating. Even the ads in the dashboard are random, often not loading properly. And lately the app is just freezing up and I have to frequently close and reopen the app. C’mon Fitness Pal! Knock it off! Consider making your whole product more stable and your premium features actually helpful and entice paid customers that way. Geez.Used this app for years to track calories and keep an eye on my nutrition, which really helped to hit weight goals. Being able to scan barcodes and quickly add various foods to great a meal was such a great feature. 

However, that was a few years ago. After a few years off I decided to redownload to get everything back on track. Now the UI changed to be very clunky and not really intuitive. Not to mention everything that made the app great (barcode scanner) is now only available for the premium membership. 

The free version isn’t worth the space on my phone. Especially since there are other alternatives. If I had to compare the current state of this app, it would be the modern equivalent to pen and paper. Again, not worth the space and especially not worth the personal data being sold to who knows. 

It’s really too bad because this app worked really well and had great features. I understand the work that went into developing and maintaining this but $20/month is a little much for something that was free years ago.Used to be quite easy to open up the app, scan your food and stay on track of your goals without any distractions. Lately though, there has been an incessant increase in ads taking over your full screen pestering you to pay for an upgrade. Now I’ve come to notice I can’t even scan barcodes anymore without paying to upgrade. What was once a FREE feature is now behind a paywall. I understand typing in your food in the search bar is just a few extra steps, but this kind of business practice is pretty scummy and I feel the app will continue down that road. Kind of the last straw for me. It was nice while it lasted.I used this app religiously a few years ago.  It help me reach my fitness and health goals. I started using it again this past month but with this last update I now have to PAY to use the same features that I have been using for free since 2014.

 I love this app and it’s ease of use but I’m not paying a monthly/ yearly fee to be able to scan barcodes. I can put up with ads and not being able to access other parts, but this is ridiculous. I’m using it for the rest of the week until I can find a new app. I don’t like that they have taken away features that used to be free.",0,"You have to pay to scan barcodes now !Most frustrating experienceWas great, now a money grabNot a fan of the auto-adjusting765+ days log in streakMoney HungrySo much to love, but one really bad thing for Watch usersThe developers deserved a Nobel prize but are blowing it.Serious IssuesGood Helpful concept - has data problemsNew updates take MyFitnessPal in the wrong directionDeleting for the first time in 8 years.Longtime user, deleting appWhen greed goes wrongRecent Updates are DisappointingUsed to be way better.

I took an 8 month break and picked it up today. Just found out that you can no longer scan barcodes without buying the premium. I was able to scan barcodes for years. It just feels like a ripoff. I’m not buying your premium even if the entire app is no longer free. I will just go use 1st Phorm’s app. One thing that I learned after studying a lot about nutrition is that your caloric intake should not be below your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). At least not for an extended period of time. And yet, years ago in the beginning of my weight loss journey the calories goals had me at 1100 calories and I found out my BMR was closer to 1400. This had a profound effect on my mental health and weight loss. I had chronic fatigue and anxiety. It was awful. There was no warning about consuming lower calorie and being in starvation. There was no place I could add a BMR so the app would take that into account. I really hope you guys can refine that more because you would be able to teach people about BMR and good nutrition. You would be able to make sure people are not starving themselves and putting a wrench in their weight loss journey. You would be able to help people not feel awful and have more energy. You would help people not have their mental health suffer due to starvation. Please fix this and give back my barcode scan and I will change my rating to 5-stars!Overall, I like the app. It has its issues and the team needs to do more work into finding an appropriate caloric amount for goals (it’s far too low and leads to an ED mindset). Luckily, we can adjust it ourselves, so at least there’s that. 
I agree that making the barcode feature premium was a low blow to your user base, and a cheap shot at making loyal users feel forced into going premium. I get it’s a business, but I would really rethink this decision. 

My main complaint is about the fasting feature though. I’ve been intermittent fasting for years. I use a different app to track it. I was excited when you announced you would be adding this feature. However, it makes the app very buggy. I find that whenever I open the app to pre-plan my meals for the day, I am being forced to end my fast. If I try to exit the fasting timer without ending my fast, the whole app crashes. Every time. I like to add my calories and plan my day in advance sometimes, or calculate a recipe I’m planning to make later on. Since I cannot do that, I will have to turn off the fasting feature and continue to use another app for this. Not a big deal for me, but this issue should be addressed and fixed, especially forcing people to pay premium. 
Also add more options for eating windows. Or let us pick our own amount of hours at least.This is a useful app for tracking progress. It’s a bit cumbersome on the exercise and Food/intake counters because it takes so long to find a matching workout / food. But for a free app - it definitely solves the tracking problem with multiple factors (unlike other free apps ) A bit Annoying that it refuses to reduce calories below 1200 even if you’re a very small , older woman and doesn’t give you the option decide whether or not you want exercise calories to be added to your daily count when you workout. So in the first weeks I was maintaining and started gaining until I realized what was going on. It also didn’t properly integrate with the weight gurus scale and I think it messed up the records because everything was working great before I “integrated” but now the history gets wiped out when I make changes in this app. Ugh! One very valuable feature is the macros calculator and the fact that you can control your percentages for your goals. Overall - a  good app definitely worth trying !Useful app for macro tracking but the UX could use some work so as to not be so confusing. When I first updated my macro goals, I went back to the Home Screen and it showed the default ones. I tried again several times but it kept showing the default macro goals on my dashboard. I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to figure it out. There is no confirm button or any feedback to indicate that you’ve updated your goals successfully, so I thought there was just some confirm button that I couldn’t find. There wasn’t, it just takes half an hour to update on the dashboard for some reason. 

This and other similar issues of not enough signifiers or proper feedback make the app confusing to use until you get the hang of it. Now that I know a bit better how it works, it’s nice to have, but I almost gave up before figuring it out due to how painful of a process it was.I’ve been using this off and on since March 2018 (and also in a previous time that seems a lifetime ago) and do not pay for any of the pro features. I find the Diary feature to be the most interest to me - giving me better insight into what I’m eating, the macros for my daily meals, and how my exercise plays into my overall goals. It is single handedly the most important feature of the app for helping to get the information I need. 

Unfortunately, my experience with the app (both today and in prior use) leaves something to be desired. I’m lucky to be able to enter a full meal without the app crashing, especially if I need to search for items that are not a frequent use item - or change the portion size. 

It is disappointing and frustrating to have had this experience with an app that can clearly help to change people’s lives, and my experience could clearly frustrate others out of making a positive life change. This is my experience, and has been consistent across several app versions, major OS changes, and at least 3 different phones (I have not tried it from an iPad to see if I have the same experience - but that would be considerably less convenient). 

I continue to use this app and appreciate the vast database of foods to pull from - I only hope that a quality of life improvement to fix the issues I’m experiencing is on the works.I wish there was an option for building muscle. I don’t weigh a lot but I definitely have fat I’d like replaced with muscle. My point is while setting up the app I noticed it’s main concern is weight; although, if I lost fat and gained muscle I would gain weight, but I’m not underweight by any means, nor do I care if my weight is maintained. So for goal oriented people (like me) this may be a set up for failure. That being said, asking for weight is definitely something that helps & I understand why it’s needed, but I think broadening the goals would help cater to people, and reinforce the fact that weight loss doesn’t always mean healthy, just as weight gain doesn’t mean unhealthy.

I have to use the app for an exercise course I’m taking at school so just thought I’d give some constructive feedback. 

[hmm I think I’ll choose “gain weight” as my goal??]So I redownloaded this after a while because I really want to keep track of my fitness goals. So I fire it up to scan my protein shake and ….barcode scanning is now a premium only feature? Really? I don’t care to pay for apps because that’s just the way things are nowadays, but there are too many choices out there to have barcode scanning as a premium only feature. I get that these things cost developers money but I have literally 2 other apps that have this feature offered without a subscription. Guess what, I also subscribe to them because the essentials are included without charge. What you’re doing is like a restaurant giving you a cup of ice for free but they charge you a premium for water. You’re app is awesome but I’ll continue with the ones I have.MFP is the best of what’s out there but has some serious drawbacks. To see if some of them might be diminished I tried the free month of the premium service. I was particularly looking for the opportunity to customize my nutritional goals (not just weight loss). I was hoping for the app to tell me how many calories, carbohydrates, grams of fiber, etc. I had consumed, not what I had left of the amount assigned by the software. It will let you change the amounts in your nutritional goals but it won’t keep them. It assigns 21 grams of fiber for women which is less than recommended by the NIH and other experts to maintain colon health and lose weight. I can change that to 30 grams but the next day it will be back to 21. Having to reassign my nutritional goals every day (as well as my target calories) is inconvenient and I certainly won’t pay $50 for it.My husband and I started using MFP when we first started dating a half decade ago to help each other stay accountable. It’s definitely helpful for that, to be able to see what you’re eating, and to track goals. You have to make sure you’re using it appropriately though. If seeing all the numbers is beneficial for you then this a good app to use.

I only gave it three stars because this last update’s color scheme leaves a lot to be desired. Everything used to be (and has been for years) color coded and very clearly sectioned apart in the daily diary. Now everything is a white, sterile slate with very little visual separation between sections. I’m not a fan. I’m sure it will continue to take some getting used to but I definitely preferred the aesthetic prior to this latest update.Overall this is a great app. It is however missing a few key features, abs maybe these are opened up with the Premium subscription. For example, it doesn’t add your workouts and calories burned from the Apple Watch/Apple Fitness app. This should be integrated without question. Also, you can’t build a meal that you make at home and instead have to add all of the ingredients. This is fine if you can then put them into a single meal, but you can’t. 

I would pay for the Premium if it was a single pay options, but there’s no way I’m paying $80/year for this app’s features. 

Overall it’s great at tracking your food and meeting your daily calorie/protein goals, but needs some modifications to the UX.I used MFP years ago and got frustrated with it and deleted it.  Decided to try again today and right off the bat another bug.  I searched for how to fix it and people have been having the same problem since 2015!!! Almost 8 years later it is still a problem. (When you change your goals for calories and macros to not fit what MFP pre calculated it will only change them for one day.) There is something about logging into the website to change them there but since I originally signed up through Apple, I have no password to get into the website.  And anyway it’s too much trouble.  Deleted again!!! Maybe someday it will be better.Great way to track your calorie intake and macros, the weight prediction feature is borderline comical, it told me if I eat 3600 calories in a day at 200lb body weight I would lose 10 pounds in 5 weeks, I have gained 12 lbs since on the diet it suggested (which is in line with my goals because I am bulking) I pretty much knew that amount of calories was a surplus for me and I would more than likely be putting on pounds.. but for someone who might not already have knowledge on calorie surpluses/ deficits, this feature could really point you in the wrong direction. I would definitely advise you to do your own research, set your own calorie goals and just use the app as a macro calculator/ weight tracker onlyI like this app for calorie and macro counting, but I started having more problems with it after paying for premium service. I have tried several times to set my nutrition goals to suit my personal needs, but the app won’t save them. The next time I log in it has reverted back to the standard settings every time. It will not easily switch from one screen to another. When I try to go between my diary, plans, goals, and nutrients, the screen goes blank and I have to restart the app for every new thing I want to see. I tried to contact customer service to ask about this but I could only get a robot response that did not answer my question.I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for about 4 months now, and recently it logged me out (which unfortunately happens fairly often). It then asked me if I wanted to update my goals. I said yes since I went from lightly active to moderately active. It then proceeded to erase all of my history - from every food diary the last 4 months to all the individual foods that I logged so that I have to go back to barcoding all the foods I had been eating. I have loved the app, but this made me livid. I have had stomach issues in the past, and logging and noting changes in my health has been very important to me and in just a second, I lost all of it. Forget about updating your goals! You’ll lose all the history you had with the app! 😠I’ve been trying to be healthier so I redownloaded this app. There is absolutely no pregnancy feature. So the app just thinks I’m overweight now and gained 30 lbs in 8 months but I’m really just about to give birth. It also doesn’t take into account the fact that I’m going to be hungry more and eating more and also exercising less. The app just thinks I’m lazy and eating over my calorie intake everyday and it’s messing up my goals and charts and makes me feel bad about myself. This app has been around for years. The fact that it doesn’t have a pregnancy feature and offer pregnancy goals is extremely baffling and a little discriminatory. Makes me not want to use it.Overall it’s not a bad app, but I do have a couple of issues with it. 

First, it is listed as being Family Share supported. The app itself is free to download, the premium features must be paid for. Apps that support family share, for example Apple Music, allow all family members to access the subscription. This is not the case with My Fitness Pal. Each user has to pay for a separate subscription. They also do not offer a family membership.  Because of this, the Family Share supported claim seems false and misleading, in my opinion. 

Second, the app does not have the option to calculate for net carbs. Most low carb diet plans take net carbs into account rather than total carbs. The workaround for this is to input all of your food values, inserting only net carbs, and not use the foods list available, which is part of the premium service. While doable, it is certainly inconvenient especially when you are paying for the foods list. 

Aside from these, the app is pretty good and has been very helpful towards our family’s health goals.Three stars: 
Good: My Fitness Pal has a large database and it’s usually easy to find a food that closely matches what I’m eating. This helps me be accountable and realize how many calories I’m really consuming; so it is helpful for losing weight. 
Bad: But I eat a whole foods, plant based diet high in complex carbs and low in all fats and protein and find it annoying when it tells me I am exceeding carb goals when my goal is to eat a lot of carbs and limit the other macros. Also it doesn’t distinguish between total sugars and added sugar. It’s the added sugar that we need to watch out for. 
Free version is adequate as the subscription version would quickly become too expensive.So far I really like this app, adding food is quite easy and it’s quite useful for setting and monitoring fitness goals.

However, it’s got a couple of bugs that are a problem on my iPhone. The main one is when adding a predefined meals. It adds it twice, sometimes three times, then I have to go delete. Today it added it three times, but only two of them are visible, so I can’t fix the third one. I’ve verified the meals are defined correctly.

Secondly, I’ve got it linked to Garmin Connect, but the only way I can get it to update the data from Garmin is to close the app and reopen.",0,"Love this app but...Intermittent fasting feature needs workUseful - limited but meets basic needHelpful but a bit confusing at firstGreat app, but plagued with crashesTarget weight shouldn’t be the only goalNo thank youIt’s OK But...Been using for MFP for yearsGood.

Easy to use logging. Love to mess with recipes to see how I can make what I want work with my calorie goals. Barcode scan is dead on balls accurate. Great accountability with notifications and information when you track food. Like, it highlights things I wasn’t even thinking about (eg, this food is high in sodium, etc). Connection with other apps and devices is solid. 

Cons:
When the app is working well, it really works well. I have had it crash twice now and lost all (the first crash, which included losing my premium information and several back and forth emails to get that reinstated without having to put again) or most (the second crash) of my data. Today there are network issues so I can’t track anything or log food. Really enjoy this app. Wish it worked as well as it sometimes does more consistently.I like this app. It’s very helpful in trying to reach a goal , but a lot of the features that make it easier to log food you have to pay for. IUnderstand not everything can be free but when you’re already paying for a gym membership and a nutritionist it becomes too expensive to pay for the other things that you feel like you need to help you reach certain goals. Also the app freezes a lot when trying to add multiple food items and half the time I can’t find the items I have that are meal prepped or even just product from the store",0,Inconsistent excellencyGood app but wish more was available for free,bexb826ANelson112,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,254,has_goals,148

It has been a great tool to track meals and activities in order to reach fitness goals. Obviously nothing is truly free, because we agree to share certain info from our devices in exchange for the use of the application. I understand that certain applications such as “MyFitnessPal” offer premium subscriptions  that remove ads and offer enhanced features to entice users to pay for the premium service. I thought it was a little uncharacteristic that a company would remove previously standard features (such as the barcode scanner) and make them part of the premium package. Still a good application, but I think removing features in order to get people to “go premium” is in poor taste.My goal in using the app to track my food was to keep track of protein for improved bone health and keep track of fat so I can increase my body weight by 5%. I am a distance runner and work with a sport nutritionist to help me achieve these goals. 

It would be great if I could share access to the app with my nutritionist. Maybe I can, but it’s not clear to me how. 

When adding food, I notice that there is a focused on packaged food. For example, type in sweet potatoes, and dozens of varieties of packaged sweet potatoes show up. Why not have the actual piece of produce first? People focused on their health are likely buying real vegetables. 

The recipe function seems to be down a LOT. So, if you have a favorite breakfast smoothie, you can add the ingredients and save it under the recipe tab so you can add it easily every morning. The recipe function is down a lot. And usually it doesn’t tell you that it’s not working until you’ve already added all the ingredients manually. 

There should be more “drill down” sections so you don’t have to back out and go to different areas of the app for detail. Makes it a little clunky. 

And then generally, I feel like the app is focused on weight loss.The app works great for food teaching. I wish it would integrate with other workout apps but I get why they don’t. My biggest issue is that your food goals don’t adjust according to overall available calories for the day. For example if you work out a ton, obviously you can afford (and should) consume more calories than a normal day sitting on the couch. However your protein/carbs/etc are only ever based on your baseline caloric goal for the day and not the actual goal once adjusted for activity. Yes you can still maintain %s but honestly this is an easy fix and I’m getting tired of getting an alert daily that xyz goal was only x grams for the day (when really it’s way more).I would’ve rated this 5 stars 🌟 if the app was more user friendly when it comes to food combinations (salad plus all ingredients). It took me 20 minutes to input every ingredient accurately. Needs to be a quicker option to add food combinations. Otherwise, I’m extremely happy with the results I’m seeing in just 3 days (5lbs loss). This app is more of a challenge to yourself that encourages you to eat less calories by making you aware of your intake. It’s especially good to know it’s not a diet restricting what you can or can’t eat but just shows you the amount you need to stay within your weight loss /gain goals.The concept of this app is amazing. I’ve had it in my phone since 2018 (free version only), and have used it on and off. But today, I just got fed up. It’s so complicated and difficult to navigate. I was trying to update my calorie goals, my weight, everything else, but it took me so much time to find everything. It would be helpful if there was one page where you could edit everything, like my profile page or something. It just has so much that overwhelms when you’re trying to update your goals/weight/food/exercise. The app could use a facelift.This app is really helpful for tracking your calories and macros, however I’m a little curious about some of their percentages. I’m wondering on what planet having no monounsaturated fats in your diet is considered healthy. According to this, I’m not allowed any monounsaturated fats, which is totally ludicrous because healthy fats are key to weight loss. Also, according to this I’m allowed an unbelievable amount of carbohydrates which for me I know I just going to cause me to gain weight.  Maybe in the premium version you can determine your own macro goals, but in the free version I’m just not sure the ratios they’re aiming for are healthy.Don’t let the 4 stars I gave it dishearten you, this app is awesome.  It definitely helps you hit goals, the barcode scanner is super helpful.  The only thing I found that keeps it from 5 stars is some of the food items in their catalog.  It seems user driven, but this causes quality control problems due to users potentially or intentionally adding items incorrectly.  I’ve seen a few food items logged as 1 calorie when it should be 100, or 2 separate ground beef entries, same lean and weight, for drastically different calorie numbers.  The app works great, just be mindful when logging your meals.This app works really well for me, but it is so annoying that you can’t set your macros to reflect net carbs instead of total carbs. I know how to figure out what they are, but I want it to be shown accurately if I’m meeting my goals and what my percentages are. This would be a really easy fix for them and I know I’m not the first person to take issue with it because it’s even addressed in their help section. They said they would take steps to add this in an update, but it’s yet to happen.

Update: leaving for CarbMaster. There’s pros and cons, but it wins by far. Seriously, with the rise of keto that you can’t track net carbs in your macros is going to kill your app.My primary interest is counting calories and macronutrients, not fitness tracking (""you lose ounces in the gym and pounds in the kitchen""). Having said that I recently switched from another app and am very pleased with all the functionality here. For example, you can follow a 5:2 intermittent-fading type diet by setting different calorie goals for different days of the week. 
Cons: the food database is not well edited; there are some suspect calorie values. It focuses on brands, as if everything you eat comes from a package or a chain store. If you are into weighing your food, you have to search for entries where units are expressed in weight vs. volume.I wish MFP would actually spend development resources on improving the core function of tracking calories and macros. Why is is still impossible to use a recipe within a recipe? Why is is so hard to correct/update product nutrition info while adding it to your diary at the same time?

They leave alone the aging user interface while adding mostly useless features like exercise (which you can’t remove from your diary view) and social networking features. 

There’s no way to set weight goals based on your body fat % either. If you, like many actual MFP users, you don’t want to be built like a stop sign and actually retain some muscle, you’ll have to do your own research and manually enter your macro allotment. Unfortunate that the app hasn’t come farther than this.

Of course, I’ll keep using it until a better, more intuitive solution comes along.",0,"Takes away standard features and makes them premiumPremium is too clunky.

This gives me an idea on how important each meal is and allows me to recognize what parts of the day I slack on my nutrition and push me to try and meet that goal. It sounds basic and obvious but having the numbers presented in front of me that I haven’t met my goal yet gives me the motivation to look around for more options to eat than I’d routinely do. It also gives me an idea of how close/far I am to reaching  those goals throughout the day. Without this feature, I can slack on breakfast or lunch and end up thinking I got a somewhat good meal, I’ll just have to eat a little more on my next meal, then by the time I get about halfway through the day and see how many calories and other nutritional categories I still have to get, I think to myself there’s no way I can get that many in the next meal or two, and I end up settling well short of my goal.This has been so awesome to use! I had stopped seeing results in my diet and found this app when looking to figure out what I was doing wrong. I am diabetic and trying the Keto diet, and using the premium features, I have been very grateful to be able to see the breakdown of my fats, proteins, and carbs. My reason for 4 stars is based solely on the fact that it can sometimes be difficult to add foods when they are homemade. I make a lot of my own recipes at home and find that I end up having to list the main ingredients for each meal. I really wish I could add my own recipes that I have created. There might even be a way to do this, but it hasn’t been easy to figure out. Overall, if you are trying Keto, or just trying to get healthy and lose extra weight, this app is awesome. The feature for adding foods using the barcodes has to be one of my favorite. This has really helped me to visualize my daily, weekly, and long term goals with structure and confidence. Highly recommended app!I wanted an app that would assist me in figuring out a healthy calorie deficit for me. This app worked perfectly! I downloaded it exactly a month ago and have already lost 6.5 lbs. since I began!

Now, I’ve used the free version so I don’t know what the paid subscription entails which is the only reason I’ve rated it four stars. 

The app set a daily calorie limit for me based on my age, weight, gender, height, and fitness goals. It allows me to track my meals, calories, nutrients, and macros. It’s well organized and easy to navigate. The barcode scanner is super convenient and quickly adds the meal info. However, not all barcodes scan but no biggie because the Quick Add option is just that — helps you quickly journal the meal and it’s calories. 

The app can also link up with your Health App so it can update your weight, steps, and exercises. You can also add in your own exercises and calories burned. 

The ads aren’t terrible and are hardly a nuisance. In fact, there was an ad to another app for at-home workouts that I downloaded and now use. 

Overall, if you’re simply looking for an app to track your calories, this free app will do just that! 

But if your serious about your fitness, don’t just rely on this one app. Make sure you are eating healthy, exercising regularly, weighing in routinely, and getting checked out by professionals.I love this app! It makes me accountable and it helps me to see how I eat. I didn’t know I was eating so bad. But this app really helps with food variety as well as keeps me on track with my food goals. It’s also very user friendly. One thing I hate is how to add the exercise. So I just use an exercise that’s close to the one I did. I also don’t like that when adding food, I don’t know how much is considered one serving. In addition to that, when adding food from the recipe, it doesn’t give you all options to put in your exact amount. Like the brownies I made, I could put that I had 1/9 because that’s not an option so I have to put it in decimal form because if you just simply log it, it may go over your calories because of whatever weird amount it puts in. Overall, really good app and because of it and my determination, I’ve already lost 5 pounds and it’s only been a week!!There is a ton of info and magical recipes for loosing weight and everyone is happy to sell you a program.  Bottom line being you need a calorie deficit to loose weight.  I quickly lost interest in logging ,  but this helped me got on track and a better understand of my caloric needs vs weight loss goals.  The app has a lot of good advice and features to help you loose weight. I am a few years into my weight loss and got stuck for a little while.  This app helped jump start the next phase for me and I have lost a solid 10 lbs since new year and continuing my weight loss journey.   Get this app, slow down your intake, up your output, and loose some weight. Don’t try and compensate for poor food choices with a bigger work out cause that’s just gonna make you want binge .  Eat right and ease up on the work outs and watch the fat slowly melt away.Fantastic tool for tracking what you eat and how that contributes to your nutritional goals. My biggest problem with the app so far is that they allowed users to add data to the nutritional database, and people are STUPID. It doesn’t matter which store you bought your fresh produce from, idiot. Non-standard units for some items - how many calories are in “a slice” of cake? Obviously incorrect data for some items - 112 calories for a half cup but 114 for a whole cup, both supposedly verified. I found myself repeatedly checking nutritional information on Wikipedia so I knew which of the wildly varying options were accurate. The barcode scan is nice because it instantly gives you the official nutritional information instead of some idiot’s estimate. I haven’t used the restaurant menu option yet. Overall, it has been very helpfulAbout a week ago my family and I found out I have type one diabetes. Now I have to start watching the carbs and sugars in everything I eat to stay healthy. So this app really helps me. 
I can put a goal of how much protein I want in a day which really helps due to my parents owning a gym and being personal trainers. This tells me how much I would weigh if I keep eating the same and it makes me wanna change how I eat to complete my goals.
I can scan the barcodes instead of typing in everything I eat. I love how we can just look at recent foods so this is very helpful for me. 
Recommend very much to use this app if you have fitness goals, body goals, if your diabetic or if you just want to watch what your eating! The whole family can definitely use this app( I’m only 13)!I recently received a kidney transplant after 4 years of waiting and I dropped weight really fast while I was on dialysis because I had no appetite whatsoever. Now that I have my new organ, I gained all my weight back. My doctor recommended this app for me so that I can keep track of what I’m eating. This has helped so much. I’m taking it slow because my kidney failure made it impossible to workout because my body couldn’t handle it. So far I’ve been keeping in line with my calories and even find myself working out more to burn the calories. It has made me think twice about some of my food choices and is helping me tackle my issue of eating and snacking when I’m not hungry. My pants are fitting better and I have a ways to go but I’m confident that this app will help me reach my goals.Why I like most is why I’m a premium member. Adding food is easy. You can scan a barcode and it pops up. Then it remembers that food so you can just start typing and it’s there. 

Also, I like the progress comparisons and how it will do a side by side for you. Your food goals with Macro percentages is also a huge plus. 

All of that is worth this app. My negatives are: the portion sizes are all different. I don’t know the difference between a gram, ounce, cup yadda yadda. If it stuck with what’s on the box it would be easiest. Also, adding exercises is a little bit of a pain. They should be in bulk, like; Pushups (mid, wide, military incline and decline) then I just add how many of which kind I did. Also, it does a great job of tracking my meals but doesn’t really offer any assistance on individual meals. As I’m adding a food, sometimes it will give me a warning (too high or you’ve gone over) but doesn’t offer anything to help me build a compete meal each time. That’s more nitpicking than anything, as I can easily add or subtract to make it work myself. 

Either way, great app and I’ll be keeping it.I’ve lost over 100 pounds, lowered my cholesterol and triglycerides, lowered my blood pressure and reversed my type 2 diabetes so I have a little experience in what it takes to get into shape. This app is awesome and I won’t go without it! I especially like being able to review everything at the end of the day so I can learn what foods work for me and which ones don’t. I’m also an actor so weight and health management are super important parts of my life! This is the best app I have found for helping me achieve my goals! I’ve read some of the reviews complaining about it no having enough bells and whistles but I absolutely love it exactly as it is. I think it’s extremely user-friendly and very well organized.I find this app useful and I’ve used if for years. It’s pretty basic (at least the free version is) but it kinda has everything you need - calorie counter, macro-nutrient break-down, weight tracker, etc. I have never tried but I’m not sure if you can adjust your macro nutrient goals. 

I have two problems. First, I find it difficult to edit my recipes. I usually end up recreating them if I change something. And I often can’t find caloric info for the foods from the restaurants/stores I frequent. I would hardly expect it to have that info for every dish from every local place but sometimes I’m surprised by what isn’t there and what is.I am very thankful for MyFitnessPal. I have used it off and on since 2012! When I stop tracking in MFP is when I fall of the wagon. Lately it has been somewhat glitchy though and lagging. Another thing I’ve noticed in the past 5 months is when you enter a new lowest weight, it doesn’t always pop up the confetti image with how much you’ve lost. I know it may sound silly, but I get disappointed when it doesn’t pop up. I am not sure why sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t? I enjoy taking a screenshots to keep track of the dates I hit certain goals. Hoping that be fixed soon.I'm preparing to do full keto after my finals so lately I've just been tracking my normal intake. With the premium free trial, it's very easy to see what foods are more problematic than I anticipated so I can do some swaps.

However, I consistently undereat, so all the articles on the feed as well as the ""progress"" tab (which are geared toward losing weight) are completely useless to be. I think it'd be a major improvement to show relevant articles based on your goals and macro preferences rather than just blanket weight loss, as well as tracking measurements over time instead of just weight.

Make those improvements and it'll be worthy of 5 stars.MFP is a great tracker app. Once you’ve created a library of your frequent foods, it’s a breeze to use. My one request is instead of keeping daily goals for days of the week, I’d like to have a toggle of “training days” vs “non-training days”. Then when I could wake up in the morning, I could set if it’s a gym day, cardio day, or rest (etc). Then my calories and macros for the day could change accordingly. If you operate on a “workout M, W, F” schedule then this app is awesome. If you’re like me and do a 3 days on, 1 day off schedule then the daily goals aren’t as helpful. Will gladly change to 5 stars with that feature addition!This app is amazing and helps you to reach your goals and learn more about your food intake. It helps you to plan out a better workout plan and tune it actually reach your goals. I’ve been skinny my entire life and wanted to put on 40lbs healthily and it helped me to reach that goal. I then made another goal to lose 20lbs and it helped me reach that. My only complaint is that you have to pay for features that used to be free. I wish they were free still and just had ads on the app instead to make up for the revenue.The best thing about My Fitness Pal is to use it you actually see your nutritional intake daily. It becomes a game of staying within you goals. An added bonus is at the end of the day you see where you are and decide what snack you can have and still stay on target. I’ve actually been able to get off my cholesterol and blood sugar medication simply because I pay attention to eating the best foods in he right amount. The key for me is this app has me paying attention to nutrition every day. It is not a diet. I am down 85 pounds after 3 years without pills or a gym.This app is great. It helps me so much with tracking my calories as well as goals. And I am so appreciative of that and all of the other great features. Unfortunately, I had to turn notifications off because they don’t work properly. I get a notification for every meal saying “you haven’t logged your meal”. However, most of the time I actually have logged my meal. So, it’s annoying. It would be helpful in the event I actually forgot to log a meal, but I can’t stand unnecessary notifications. Hoping this gets resolved so I can use the notifications in the event I do actually forget to log a meal.This App is incredible!  I absolutely love it and I find it invaluable to holding myself accountable for daily goals. I work like to see further improvements to make it even easier to log meals, exercise, and activity.  I am meeting health goals with the assistance of My Fitness Pal. I would like to see a clear way to link my Apple Watch so that the App accurately picks up my daily activity, including the steps I walk. I would like to be able to speak to the App on my iPhon or iWatch to record info. This is an amazing App that likely will become even better!

The graphs are nice, I have not felt the need for the pay version (free works fine for me). I use it for food logging and send all the data to my Fitbit for the best of both worlds. Few things that I think are missing from this app (and others). 
1) It would be nice to track other body measurements like bust, legs, arm etc.  Also, it would be nice if you could actually 'track your fitness' and measure goals for that. It is called 'myfitnesspal' after all! 
2) It would be nice if you could measure as you increased weight or reps for strength training And see this reported so that you could visualize the accomplishment. 
3). I think this isn’t best food tracker out there, but what it’s missing is an ability to track how you ‘feel’. If you could add things like bloated, tired, gassy, headache, or other common terms you could see the impact that certain foods or lack of exercise had on you. And this could motivate you to creat new habits or stick to those your trying to incorporate into your routine.This app is so awesome in terms of the food database which is the main reason that I use it. But I am on a strict and permanent low carb/keto diet. This app does NOT give me an accurate consumption of my daily carbs because it doesn’t include net carbs. YES, I realize that you can just subtract fiber from total carbs but this is NOT what is used to determine your daily macros. Some days my macros will show that I had between 11-15% carbohydrate consumption for the day when almost 2/3 of that amount is fiber (aka carbs that DO NOT affect blood sugar). It’s really disappointing and discouraging to not have a setting that allows me to implement my personal goals. Please add a net carbs setting and this app will be perfect! I am contemplating whether or not to continue subscribing to the premium. I will definitely cancel my subscription if a net carb setting is not implemented within the next few months because I simply cannot keep track of my goals without that.Love ease of weight tracking. Love calorie logging with available nutrition count. That said......wish I could make changes to my goals on the main page without the nuisance of having to go, and log in to a different page. Biggest complaint is on home page with ""blogs"". Really dislike seeing scrumptious photos of food.......with no link to recipe!!! Recently there were avocado halves with an egg cooked in them garnished with bacon. Sure.....I could wing it. But why should I have to risk messing up a meal. Make it a requirement on blogs. No yummy photo without recipe! All in all, this is best site for weight/health conscious people.I’ve been using this app religiously for years to stay accountable. It’s super easy to use and navigate!
However There is a small error that recently started happening with the customizable macro settings. You can change the macros under “goals” but the totals will not update under the daily nutrient view. So although my personal goal is 190 protein, under the daily view/nutrients it will show close to 300g per day as my daily goal. Small glitch that just recently started happening but other than that I have loved using this app to track my low carb diet.",0,Best calorie tracker that's freePLEASE ADD A NET CARBS SETTING!!!90% greatGreat to stay on track!,Mal5177sassmaster93Ear14mariachayo,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,596,has_goals,148

-KlahrI’ve been a MyFitnessPal user for 6 years now. I want to start by saying when I first started using it, I was using this app religiously. I managed to lose 15 pounds in 3 months. However, I was losing weight for all the wrong reasons and found myself tracking my diet and making sure I was only eating 1500 calories a day when I should have been getting 2000. As soon as I stopped using it, I kept the same weight until I went to college. Freshman 15 is a real thing and that is exactly what happened. I gained all my weight back but it wasn’t just fat, I was gaining muscle too because I found myself weightlifting regularly. 2 years later, I found myself big with a slightly higher than normal fat percentage. That is when I started using my fitness pal again. Now I use this app correctly, and have been losing a moderate and healthy amount of fat a month, by keeping track of my macronutrients and making sure everything that I eat align with my goals. This app does exactly that. Now I have gotten into a routine of logging my food. It used to be a chore, but now it’s a habit and it’s a habit I’m happy to have!This is a great app for being able to track what you eat fairly accurately and Ada tool to help you plan what to eat to ensure you stay on track for your weight loss goals . 

I am using the free version and have lost 16kgs in the last 3 months helped specifically by the app.  It has helped me understand the real energy values of my original diet , helped me understand the values of the healthier options so that I can plan my basic menu daily to stay n track.

After using the app to understand how to manage my diet choices better I added exercise into the mix.  The MyFitnessPal app interfaces with the Activities App really well so that all the energy used during exercise is added to your daily intake allowance.  This allows me to plan exercise around days that I know I am going to be consuming more so that I have a positive balance most days.

I find the data is comprehensive ,  the scanning option a big plus and the My Recipes tool very useful and it gives me confidence in knowing with reasonable certain of the energy values and macros of all the items I am eating.

I have used this as my main tool daily over the 3 month weight loss journey and would recommend it to anyone.  Of course you have to have the discipline to enter all the information and I suggest that you take the time to do it as then you will be able to see the results.  Easy to use , convenient and professional.I’ve been using this app for about 3 years, and just purchased the Premium version within the last year. I loved the app before, but love it even more with the Premium features! I am usually a non-believer that Premium changes much, but it has helped me structure and track my goals more closely. I especially like the freedom to adjust my macronutrients by gram, and to see the overview of my meal entries in grams, not percentages. I have been reverse dieting for about a year, so I appreciate that the app doesn’t see weight gain as bad, and rather reports it just as the stat it is. Many other apps like this are weight loss-focused, so I appreciate MFP’s neutral stance on the goals people may have.
This app overall has been awesome to use. I would recommend it to anyone, and I will keep using it myself for the foreseeable future. It has the flexibility to work with anyone’s goals, and the power to maintain a long history of daily tracking and progress updates.To the reader who needs to gain weight:
Thanks to MyFitnessPro, I’ve been able to gain weight better, healthier and keep myself honest with how much I’m eating. It’s even become fun. I’ve been underweight most of my life because of health reasons that run in my family. Half the time food tastes like ash. With how much I can do with this app, I can set goals, find new meals as well as note which meals I like best, and have the ability to work on myself more effectively and healthily. I’ve hit the weight I need twice since starting use of this app, and once I even exceeded by 7lbs (which is so hard to do! If you’ve been underweight your whole life, gaining weight is just as difficult as losing weight!!!) Every goal has it’s challenges, but using this to help push you and make the best decisions for your health will certainly help. A dash of self motivation is all you need. Best of luck!!Love this app. Immensely better than when I tried it years ago.  I lost weight on Noom and love them and their app immensely. But I’m on my own now and tried LifeSum but it didn’t allow me to enter cups or tsp or tbsp most of the time. I like those measures because I cook and it’s easy for me to estimate. I heard MyFitnessPal was better so I tried it again and it’s the app for me. It is easy, quick, smart, tracks steps from my iPhone, and today it compelled me to write a review because I was so happy when I hit ‘complete my diary for the day’ and it told me if every day was like that one I would lose 5 lbs in 4 weeks.  So it is encouraging too!  Free version also warns me when I’m eating something unhealthy and how it fits or doesn’t with my goals. It also gives me my nutrient measurements for FREE and there are A LOT of nutrients listed.  I can create meals and it’s easy to pick foods I ate recently. Thanks app devs!!!I’ve been using this app for a little over two weeks now and it is an absolute life changer.  I’ve been struggling to maintain the necessary nutrition for my weight loss goals because I have never found a consistent convenient way to track calories and macro nutrients (protein, carbs, fats).  This app is AMAZING!  It makes calorie counting not only convenient, but also kind of fun.  Additionally, it helps me take my nutrition beyond just calorie counting and breaks my meals up across the macros based on goals I have set.  If you are using some other app/ system to do this, I would be hard pressed to believe it works as well or even close to as well as this one does.  I don’t think I’ve even discovered all the capabilities this app offers, but when I do I’ll be sure to share.  Definitely can’t go wrong with this app by your side.  I have to give a big thanks to whoever designed it.Great app that helps keep track of calories and tells u ur nutrition and helps u lose weight safely. Have used 4 days and have lost 2 lbs so far. Was on a diet already and have lost 20 lbs but plateaued and was stuck over a month on same weight. After starting app I have started losing weight again and am eating more which is awesome. I was hurting myself restricting myself from food. Now hv more energy , feel full and satisfied. Not starving anymore and still losing weight. I’m thinking of trying premium when I start working out. Probably in beginning of 2022. But free app is so awesome still and an excellent resource to keep you on track for your weight loss goals and for any other goals you may have I’m sure. Looks like good also for working out . Very informative app and user friendly as well. Haven’t found a better app yet.MyFitnessPal has become an indispensable tool on my fitness journey. This app has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. From tracking my daily calorie intake to monitoring my exercise routines, it's been a game-changer in achieving my fitness goals.

The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it easy to log meals and workouts with just a few taps. The extensive food database ensures that I can find virtually any food item, making calorie tracking effortless. I love how it remembers my most frequently logged foods, saving me time in the long run.

The app's progress charts and personalized insights have been incredibly motivating. It's gratifying to see my progress over time, and the app's gentle reminders keep me accountable and focused on my targets.

Additionally, the integration with various fitness devices and other apps simplifies data syncing, making sure my progress is always up to date. The community feature is a bonus, as I get to connect with like-minded individuals, share tips, and cheer each other on.

Overall, MyFitnessPal has truly transformed the way I approach fitness and nutrition. I can't imagine my journey without it. If you're looking for an app that's user-friendly, comprehensive, and supportive, MyFitnessPal is the one for you. Highly recommended! 👍This app has an incredible database of food. I’m impressed with the number of product specific foods and regional choices. I like being able to track my weight over time. I like being able to add exercise and water tracking. I really like seeing a breakdown of my macro and micro nutrients. I can adjust my nutritional abs weight goals easily. Adding foods to your diary gets easier as the app keeps a record of what foods you’ve entered before. I’ve created my own recipes and added those to the database. It’s a very user friendly program. Occasionally there are errors in the nutritional info, but that’s easy to forgive given all of the other strengths of this app.  I’ve checked out a few of the other tracking apps and I find this one to be far superior. I don’t even use the premium version and I love it.At 54, I have tried many diets and weight loss approaches. I know about carbs, exercise, and moderation. My weight has never skyrocketed-  just quietly crept up a pound or two a year. Fitness Pal helps bring awareness to what I am eating. (I log my exercise on a chalk board in my kitchen, so the only features I use here are the food diary and progress chart). When the diary pops up with “ If you continue eating this way, in five weeks you will weigh...” I pause and think about my goals. I resist any feelings of shame or judgment. After all, it’s just an algorithm. The choice to gain or lose weight is all mine. Fitness Pal is a good match for people who already know about nutrition, and don’t need the support of a weight loss community. This app will bring awareness to what you are doing to avoid or meet your goals.I have only been using My Fitness Pal 4 days, but it really helps you realize how much sugar & carbs you really are putting into your body. It documents everything I use to(calories,macros,water,weight, note section- I use to remind me what I need to work on), but faster. I love capturing the image of the barcode & all I have to do is adjust the serving size. I use to get tired of documenting after 2-4 weeks, now I anticipate going a long way with the effortless of documentation with My Fitness pal. Also it reminds you when you are off your goals and offer recipes, advice videos, & exercise programs. It’s worth it to get the premium package!! I needed affordable accountability & I feel I have found it in My Fitness Pal. Hallelujah the lightbulb has come on!!This is seriously the best app ever to easily track your food for calorie count, macros, micronutrients, progress (all sorts of measurements other than weight), and so much more. There’s recipe ideas, you can connect with friends and see progress, you can edit your macro goals, input your own recipes from the web (or manually) and swap out the generic suggestions for what you are actually using and honestly everything you can think of. It helped me lose weight years ago and helps me be on top of my diet now again— down 15 lbs! The free version allows you to do all that I just mentioned. It’s seriously my best weight loss tool, and I would recommend it 100% in a heart beat. Hard to say what can even be improved on it to be honest!I used this app years ago. It helped me and my chiropractor monitor weight loss /nutrition goals.(He would actually look at my logged meals, workouts, and goals. Making adjustments to my plan from the information off of My Fitness Pal)
Was able to go from 220 lbs to my goal weight of 185 in a couple of months, safely .
Over the years (10 to be exact) my weight has gained. Downloaded a Keto app for $40. Was very disappointed. Remembered My Fitness Pal. Logged in to find all info was still stored. Begun the nutrition  plan, logging meals and workouts. Can’t say how awesome it is to feel the fat dripping off and muscles gaining strength (At 60 years old)
Thanks Pal for all the user friendly upgrades and this awesome appCurrently I am tracking micros and love the feature of providing specific numbers, other apps I have tried have limits to this feature. The recipes are great too with the exception of not having serving size. I have read the comments provided by MyFitness Pal regarding this issue. It’s slightly inconvenient but not enough to not use the recipe feature. The only critique I would have is the accessibility to modify your daily defaults goals. Such changing your workout days to adjust macros. This requires going through multiple steps with your profile. It would be great if it would be more accessible, such as at the bottom of the diary. Otherwise I absolutely love this app!!I used this app many years ago and had forgotten about it. A friend was using it so I thought I would give it a try. I set modest goals. I have lost 12 pounds in a month and a half. I still eat regular food but I am aware of how many calories eat thing I eat has so I am making better choices. You can connect it to step tracker apps or devices to track your exercise. Calorie intake allowances are adjusted with calories burned. 

The key thing to know is that you must enter everything you eat, including oil to cook with, in order to make it work for you. If you cheat you won’t lose weight. It seemed time consuming at first but now it  takes no more than 5-10 minutes a day, depending on the recipes I make.After losing 20 pounds I hit a plateau. I was frustrated and couldn’t figure out why I stopped losing weight, I was tracking my steps, fasting, and made healthier choices with my diet. 

This app saved me, I’ve lost 15 pounds with it so far and it helps keep me motivated to lose more. 

I love that it shows you your daily nutrients, encourages you to meet your goals (now I’m focused on a high protein/fiber and low fat diet, which is the only thing that keeps me FULL. I knew I needed more fiber but I never realized how important protein is for your body and keeping you stuffed and energized. It also helps you realize what you’re missing in your diet (I found out I was low on vitamin C, iron and calcium) 

It also keeps me strong with sugar, encouraging me to stay in my limits and if I pass it one day I’m more motivated to make healthier choices the next day.

There are so many other great features that I can’t list because I could go on all day, it’s just that great.

Just download it! You won’t regret it 💕 I also recommend the “Pacer” app if you’re dead set on shedding some weight. Track your steps and eat clean 🧼 💛 good luck peopleAccountability. I think it’s the biggest thing that this app helps with. I have lost 176 pounds total my weight loss journey has been over a number of years. Some people may think it’s a slow process but losing it  slow and gradual is keeping it off the best way. Over Covid I did gain 58 pounds back, but now I have lost 62 pounds of it and with this app again found it is so much easier to accomplish my goals.  Somedays are hard to complete but if you set the notifications then it helps also. It’s well worth it. I don’t use the premium just the free and it works just fine. I now have 24-26 to go for my goal weight!!
Thank you my fitness pal!!My fitness pal is a very good app for tracking food and activity whether you are trying to loose weight, maintain weight or gain weight. Logging your food and activities is simple especially when you have been doing it for awhile because it builds a list of your commonly used items. Overall a great app. I have used both the free app and the premium version and both work well depending on what you need.  I recently started tracking macros and wanted to be able to change the goals and I believe you can only do that with the paid version. Whenever I need to loose weight I have found that the only way I can do it is by tracking what I eat and this app is always what I use!MyFitnessPal is the springboard for every health improvement plan I support. Before starting a new lifestyle (or diet😒) I recommend friends, family members, and clients to spend 2-4 getting in the habit of logging everything they put in their mouths, as well as the times these activities are taking place...no judgement and with complete honesty. This really helps figure out strengths and opportunities in habits to help move towards goals. 
This app, however, is only as good as the data entered. If you’re not willing to journal the info and work with the information you receive you will not see changes. If you’re serious about moving towards your goals MyFitnessPal is a crucial partner.MyFitnessPal is an exceptional app that has truly transformed my fitness journey. With its user-friendly interface and extensive features, it stands out as the ultimate companion for anyone striving to lead a healthier lifestyle. The ability to effortlessly track my daily meals, water intake, and exercise routines has been a game-changer in helping me achieve my fitness goals.

One of the most impressive aspects of the app is its vast database of food items, making it a breeze to log my meals accurately. The personalized recommendations and calorie goals keep me motivated and on track, while the progress charts showcase my achievements beautifully.

Moreover, the seamless integration with fitness wearables and other health apps makes it a comprehensive health hub. The community aspect provides a sense of support and encouragement, making the fitness journey feel like a shared experience.

In conclusion, MyFitnessPal is a must-have app for anyone seeking a positive, uplifting, and effective fitness companion. It's no wonder it's a leader in the health and fitness app market.Love this app. Love that is easy to log food and exercise. Love that the free version allows you to set target goals for macros with both gram and percentages and allows you to keep up with other important nutrients including fiber. I’ve been using it for 9 years and it has helped me find my way to a healthier weight and make sure I’m getting my targeted macro nutrients. For me weight loss has been slow and I feel encouraged to look over the years and see how my weight has slowly dropped to a much healthier level. I teach fitness classes in college and have my students do an assignment using this app for awareness of nutrient intake.I love MyFitnessPal - it makes tracking my food and manage not just calories but the essential carbs, protein and fat ratio so easily.  You can import your favorite recipes and MyFitnessPal also provides great recipes as well.  Their food database is just about endless including many store brands.  When it comes to fitness they also shine here with videos and you can link many of the fitness trackers out there so you are not miss a beat in your fitness quest.  I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to change they lifestyle - because that is what weight loss is all about and MyFitnessPal also provides very informative emails to help you reach your goalsThis app provides a very easy way to track your intake of food with an amazing database of all foods. It makes you more aware of good choices and helps you maintain calorie threshold goals for weight loss and maintenance. It helps you become more aware of nutritional content and the 3 foods you should avoid be a high food like sugar; fat and sodium. It shows you the benefits of exercise by tracking caloric burning of exercise and providing you with net daily calories. It also features a water tracker. The line charts over time feature is a great one that illustrates your progress. A highly recommended app.A friend of mine recommended this app to me about 4 years ago and I began using the free version of it to track my calories. I lost over 40 pounds in less than 6 months. Foolishly I thought that I was cured of my bad eating habits and I quit using MyFitnessPal. Now years later I not only gained back all that I lost I added about 30 more pounds to that. I finally realized that tracking what you eat and tracking your exercise and setting goals is the key component to success. It makes you more conscious of your decisions and you find yourself making better choices.I’ve used this app for well over a year. I track my weight, water intake, meals and macros, daily steps, as well as other exercise.  Through the process, I learned that many foods I thought were healthy have way too much fat or carbs for me to meet my goals. I have learned portion size and the importance of weighing and measuring my food. Sometimes I ate too much and other times I did not eat as much as I thought, thus shorting myself on protein and important nutrients. I also love the ability to create recipes to easily enter the foods I eat often. I recommend this app to my friends all the time.MyFitnessPal overall is a great app.  I paid the yearly subscription which helped me count down my calories and macronutrient content so I’m always hitting my calorie goals. The quick add is nice if I follow a recipe online, the barcode scanning is great , and if I were I ate the same thing from yesterday it’s a quick easy step.  I do wish they had how much calories I need to lose weight, how much calories I need to maintain, and how much calories I need to gain. Definitely worth it and highly recommend having a food weight scale to help track your caloric intake.I'm just using the free version for now and it's really really good. My fave feature is the ability to scan products and instantly see the calories and other details. It helps me make wiser feeding choices and stick to my caloric goals for the day. Also when I go over my daily caloric limit, I work out, input the details on the app and balance out the calories so I'm always on track. I've been fasting intermittently for a week now and I use this app to track and document my feeding. So far I've lost 3.2kg by sticking to under 1200 calories daily. Summary of the story, MyFitnessPal is awesome 💃I had struggle losing weight in a healthy manner and putting on good muscle. This kept all my macro and micro nutrient in checks and i could also see my vitamin consumption. This really works if you use it properly and set goals and try to be within a good range of your target, losing weight is easy. The best part is you don’t have to enter things every time. Snap a barcode or choose a ready made meal and you can easily approximate how much nutrients you are getting. Very accurate. Be honest with yourself and this will pay off within 2 months guarantee you can lose 10-15 pounds.This app is amazing for finding the nutritional value of everything you eat along with personalizing diets goals to your right fit. Almost about everything you can find in a store is logged on the app making it easy to track. I’m a power lifter and use this app to make sure I’m eating enough protein carbs and calories. The free plan is very good however the premium subscription allows you to scan packages for their nutritional information and get diet and exercise plans which is helpful for beginners in fitness.  highly recommendedWhen I use it, I lose weight. I really like the ability to scan food and use their vast collection of foods stored on the system. I like the upgrades to analyze the types of food that I am eating. I also like the information on exercise and weight loss. I think they are very beneficial, and they really encourage me to strive towards my goals. I see there is a section how to take notes on exercise.  I would like a section to take notes on my thoughts and feelings about my eating behavior. Overall, it’s a great app and I highly recommend it.If you won’t log your food, this app won’t work. If you will and do, it is a fabulous tool for accomplishing your goals. Your commitment is key. When you log what you eat, you discover “hidden” carbs and fats, what really has protein, and how to balance those three items in a way that is optimal for you and your goals. You can tailor your dinner by checking your percentages after lunch. You can plan ahead for a big night out by eating judiciously during the day. This app allows you to be in control! Use it!This app made me realize how much I really eat and it gives great info on foods if it’s bad or not and how many carbs, fat, and protein you intake while letting you have progress pictures and watches my water intake I just started this app a week ago and feel energy again and healthier watching what I eat and I’ve lost 9 lbs (no this isn't fake I’m honest) I’ve tried others and they were not free and/or not organized and if you didn’t pay they wouldn’t care about you but this app really helps and helps me visualize my plans which makes it easier to get my goals.MyFitnessPal is an amazing app that I would recommend to ANYONE! It helps you learn so much about what you put into your body and allows you to objectively see that you are in track to meet your goals. This app has changed my life forever as it has already helped me lose 30 pounds and 17% body fat! It takes the worry out of the equation and I never wonder if I'm eating the right amount of food or if I'm getting enough protein. Losing weight and body fat is simple if you eat in a calorie deficit. Eating in a calorie deficit is simple if you use MyFitnessPal!I have used my fitness pal for three years now and it has been the best for maintaining and losing weight there is literally nothing in its database that you can’t find to find the calories the amounts and even after you lose enough weight where you’re happy and helps you feel good that you’re not deviating keep you honest and it’s simple and easy to use I love it and I highly recommend it once you get the weight off you can use it more casually and not as strict and it never let you get too far away from your goalsI am trying to trim the body fat, and have used several different fitness and food apps with disappointing results. However, I have found my true love. What I deeply appreciate about this app is (1) it has a huge inventory of foods to track the nutritional information of the foods I eat (like the brand of airplane snacks on my Delta flight, and my favorite red wine), (2) it tracks macros and lets me customize my macro goals, (3) it’s fairly intuitive to use, and (4) it connects to Apple’s Health app. And that’s just after two days of using. Thank you Under Armour.In the world of fake news, its nice to know the information in the app, despite being based on user input, is (for the most part) accurate. You should still check any info that seems too goo to be true (12 oreos are NOT 50 calories!), but with a bit if searching you can find what works for you. If you are using it regularly, its gets very easy to use and is GREAT for keeping track of what you REALLY eat- in real time! You can project out your meals for the day, or even a few days ahead and make your goals more attainable!I tried multiple dieting apps before settling on this one. They all have their strengths but this one has the most complete and most accurate database of foods. I have learned that is the most important feature of these apps. In eight months of daily use I have found only three foods with an error. The only three foods I didn’t find were from Costco, which carries custom versions of products. But almost all Costco foods have been in the database. I have lost 42 pounds since switching to this app, which is exactly on target for meeting my goals.This is the best dieting app out there. If you are struggling to follow any diet counting macros then this is the app for you! And it does it all for you, you get to type in your goals and then the app will tell you your allotted calories for the day, which can even go up with exercise (and by counting your steps). All you have to do is type in a food and it will take down all of the food’s nutrition facts itself and you can look at where your macros are at throughout the day. This app has been extremely helpful to me for reaching my fitness goals.I’ve started using this app seriously in late November 2022. And I have to say, it has seriously impacted my life and helped me to stay on track with my health goals. It is so easy to track my calories and nutrients each day, which helps me maintain my calorie deficit easily. I upgraded to the full membership as well since I like it so much; I absolutely love the barcode scan feature for logging my snacks. I am proud to say that I’ve lost over 20 pounds so far since I’ve started using this service. MyFitnessPal is great!I have used spreadsheets and apps to track diet and exercise. The free version of this app has all that i need to track weight, diet, exercise, and even distribution of carbs/fat/protein. I have paid for apps that do much less and less efficiently. This is perfect for my needs. Many apps sell you the idea that they can meet your goals in x/weeks. No app or program will magically achieve your goals for you. If you have the commitment and dedication tools are what is needed and this tool is an excellent choice.EASY TO USE !!!! FUN !!!! 
Excellent comprehensive app that personally addresses ones goals toward Weight lose while keeping your strength from every significant aspect—  from food meal plans ( if u wish ) exercise -water - consumption - food tracking - total calories per day - based on your goals - in your time frame - the user sets the goals - 
Progress charts - it has every aspect to be successful and EASY to use !
In four days I have experienced progress towards MY goal - 
My Fitness Pal is a safe knowledgeable method! I recommend it !This is great app!  It allowed me to get back to my college running weight without doing ANY exercising!  Pretty cool, I just tracked my food, kept to my nutrition goals, sat on the couch and the weight came off! Once I got my weight where it was back in high school (I’m 55 years old now), I decided I needed another goal so I don’t gain the weight back.  I’ve decided to start doing Spartan obstacle course races.  Now that I’m back off the couch, I track my exercise through Fitbit and it auto syncs to MyFitnessPal, adjusts my calories as needed, and I’m maintaining my high school weight.  Pretty cool!I love this app! This app has an exhaustive list of foods so it’s easy to track what you’ve eaten. Especially for me as a vegetarian who eats a lot of Indian and other ethnic foods, it’s been hard to tell how many calories I’ve had, but this app is great and makes it so easy to stick with dietary goals. And I love the newsletter it emails to you because it chock full of awesome nutritional and fitness advice. This app also tracks the exercise you do and daily steps, etc. So many good features. Anyone who seriously wants to make a change would benefit greatly with this app!This app is so simple to use and has everything I could ever need! I've been logging meals, water, weight, and exercise for 85 days in a row now and thanks to MyFitnessPal I'm down 20 lbs! I had no idea how much I was overeating until I started logging my meals/snacks.

Update: it has now been 10 months since I started using MyFitnessPal to get healthier and I am down 35lbs 😱 never in a million years did I see myself accomplishing these goals-- so much thanks goes to this app for putting me in the right direction!

However, the newest update has destroyed the app and I am going to start looking for alternatives. After years of positive word of mouth comments from me to others I am no longer recommending the app/service and I encourage anyone hunting for a calorie tracking service to look elsewhere. The update is terrible and makes using the app a chore. This isn’t what the app used to offer and it isn’t what is needed when you are trying to get your weight under control. Big thumbs down for the changes.

Update-I’ve now played around with the app more since I wrote my review and I’ve changed my opinion some. I think the app is worse than I originally thought it was. If you are just starting out I can find no reason to recommend this app to you. I was dismayed to find that they even hold the ability to export my nearly 9 years of weight data hostage behind the paywall. Seriously?!?!  I am done with this app. Don’t fall for it. Find a different service and good luck on your fitness journey!I used this app for years and loved it. I heard an update was coming that would not allow you to enter food via barcode unless upgrading to the premium membership. That was kinda lame, but as long as I could still search the database and enter foods manually, it wasn’t too big of a deal. 
 Well now, you can’t even search the food database unless you upgrade to premium. It will only let you search through your meal history for foods to add. So, unless you’re on the premium membership, you can’t even really add foods to your diary, which renders the app (for me) pretty useless. 
 My advice would be to offer membership tiers. All I want is to enter barcodes and search foods. I don’t need all the training stuff, weird nutrient tracking stuff, and all the other doodads. I can’t justify paying so much money per month just to use the database and scan barcodes. 
 I wish I could give it more stars, but sorry. You priced me out. Until you make an affordable option, you’re going to be stuck with my review 🤷🏼‍♂️I’ve used MyFitnessPal for a long long long time. I’ve tried many other apps and I come back to MyFitnessPal because it has my history and my recipes I’ve entered as well as the community ones. I can even find Chinese dishes written both in English and Chinese to approximately calories and macros. It’s great for tracking and I also appreciate that I can join it up to Apple health to read and write health data. It’s a big reason I finally gave up on the Fitbit ecosystem after owning multiple devices. 

This redesign in June 2022 looks nice as long as you don’t use it. I couldn’t find the progress feature for weight progress. It’s moved below the fold with no clear indication you need to scroll down. When you do scroll down the app has a hard stop at the ad forcing you to look at it before a few seconds later it allows you to finally scroll past it. I’m on an iPhone 13 pro and the app is laggy and glitchy. Maybe the latest most powerful iPhone can’t handle an app scrolling static information? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I have been using the premium version since December with great success. I’m tracking foods by macros or was until yesterday. I’ve been charged twice for the Premium version this month so I asked Apple to refund one of those charges. As soon as they did, MFP asks me to go Premium again. My premium features are gone! I only see the free version even though I’ve paid for Premium!!! But wait there’s more!

I’ve submitted 4 tickets through the App Support link and have only received automated emails with tips on how to fix login issues. Logging in isn’t the problem! Nevertheless, I followed their trouble-shooting steps and have lost my history since December! Which wouldn’t matter except my coach needs that info since I’m cutting!!!! I haven’t been able to accurately track my macros for two days now.  The app isn’t working and the Support isn’t there for customers who rely on it for prepping for a competition as of yesterday!I downloaded this app when it first came out. All the sudden with in a couple of months I started getting so much junk mail from various sporting goods and apps, particularly Under Armor, that I couldn’t keep up. Every time I unsubscribed, I’d get two new emails from different companies. Despite unsubscribing from Under Armor no less than TEN time, I kept getting emails from them, sometimes once a day, sometimes five times a day. I wrote to them and asked about not only their own email, but also all the other companies. They denied selling my info and in a less than helpful way, told me to go to me “My Fitness Pal” app and manage my emails. I did this and did it help? Nope. I threatened legal action and it finally stopped. THEN a news story about how this company had a data breach that they hide until they couldn’t hide it any longer. AVOID THIS APP, UNDER ARMOR and anything associated with it, you’ll save yourself a headache trust me.I've been a user of My Fitness Pal since 2013 and have always liked it. While I have tolerated the recent addition of ads, I find that forcing me to watch a 5 minute long video ad which cannot be skipped when trying to locate a restaurant's menu is obnoxious and insulting. Given my 3 year history using this application I am hesitant to look for alternatives but if this worsens then I may do so. C'mon MFP, if you do ads keep them simple and discrete.

^the above I wrote some years ago when the advertisements were new. The problem is even worse now to the point where I have jumped ship. Logging a meal and being forced to watch a pop up ad, and then being informed that the scanner is being removed unless you are a premium user is too much. 

At this point you might as well be 100% paid subscription. It’s not worth using as a free user at all.I have been using this app for literal years… Since it came out. I use it daily and don’t miss a day. But I noticed that overtime little changes are occurring and I’m about sick of it. Firstly the history has shortened meaning that you are recently logged foods list is very minimal. Now I have been getting the stupid pop-up when I’m trying to log my food. And to put the cherry on top I just received an email that they are taking away the barcode scanner unless you pay for premium. So you know what I’m done with this app… This is not the only calorie counting app that exists… So I’m going right now in the App Store to find another one and deleting this app and unsubscribing to any emails. This is a slap in the face to long time users. The other two things I could deal with but the pop-up and now the barcode scanner going away… Shove your app where the sun doesn’t shineHad this app for years. Was off the app for about a year and a half because life got in the way, but decided to go back on to get healthier. Typical nutrition journey story. Went back on today to find the interface had changed (makes sense -it’s been a while and maybe they improved things, I thought…Sadly, that was NOT the case. A paywall jumps up every time I push ANY buttons. The barcode scanner was free,  now no longer free (obviously that’s the way they are trying to get users to pay for the $20 a month subscription) ~Maybe~ that’s a fair price if you live in certain cities, but for many that price is gauging. And for what? To get back something that was already free (barcode scan) and to reduce ads while still making $$ anyway tracking us? Unethical. Sigh, Guess I need to find a new logging app…I’ve been using this app to track my food and progress for probably 8 years or so and the quality has gone downhill so much that I’m looking for a different app. The fact that features that used to be free are gated behind not a single fee but a monthly fee is insane. I’d pay $30 for premium but who in the world is paying $20/month!? Not being able to scan in items, or enter them manually is frustrating. Also the comparison function of the progress photos is BROKEN. You see your most recent ones and the rest are either sideways or zoomed in so much you can’t actually compare anything. And lastly, my history of my food journals erased after a period of time so I can’t go back to like November to see what I was eating. So sad, I used to recommend this app to everyone.This is the OG calorie tracking app. It used to be best and unique. But now apps like this are everywhere. You don’t have to use this one. Before you really needed to and most features were free with the ads. But now even basic features like scan bar codes are only available to premium members. And their premium isn’t cheap. You can find many other calorie trackers that allow you to this basic function for free. Unfortunately for me I’m trapped in this ecosystem with 10 years of results and history. If I can ever find another app that will import a csv, I’ll pay premium long enough to export my data, get it in a different app, and say goodbye to these greedy extortionist.

Edit: Lose it.  An app that doesn’t charge 3 times what is worth for basic functionality.It used to be a pretty good app. In early 2022 they did a massive UI overhaul that didn’t add anything useful to me. It just made it take more taps to do everything. It’s also way, way slower to start up. Each time you run it, it shows a snapshot of the last screen you were on. Then after a long wait it suddenly jumps to the Overview screen and applies your taps to the wrong UI widgets. It annoys me multiple times a day. I’m gone the day another food diary app shows up that can import my MFP history. Also, what’s with the pregnant belly bump at the bottom of the screen now? There’s this blue curve they added that serves zero purpose other than blocking an extra slice of valuable screen space. It doesn’t even hide itself when the user scrolls. Who thinks that decoration is helpful?After weeks of on/off communication w MFP support they have not been able to help me regain access to my account. It’s like it never existed. The app and web logins tell me I have entered invalid user/password. A reset email is never received even though I get all other emails from MFP including ones for a new account I created. MFP doesn’t find my account... only my the new account I created a week ago.  Also I recently purchased the year paid version and no longer have access to it. Because it’s been over 60 days Apple can refund my money, MFP can’t transfer to a new account and the only way I may get my money back is to do a dispute with my credit card. Which I will attempt but really I just want my account back with a decade of data (history, meals, recipes etc). Disappointed.I am starting to look at alternatives after using the app daily since 2014. I understand the need for monetization and I am actually willing to pay a subscription for a service worth its cost, as I do with others, but the current price for premium is far too much for the minimal features I used during the free trial. I continued to endure the obnoxious ads that were added to just about every other step you take within the app. Moving the barcode scanning to Premium today may be the last straw for me though. I respect businesses that add features and true value to their subscription services but the gradual decrease in this app’s basic functionality merits an uninstall despite over 7 years of daily history with it.This app used to be perfect and after the recent update they totally ruined it. It used to be very convenient to log ur food and weight with one button now the app feels very clunky where u have to click all over the place to do the most basic things. And taking away the barcode scanner, huge mistake, sure u can search all over the place for what ur looking for and use ur previous log history but honestly who has time for that, and I’m not going to pay for this simple convenience when all I’m using the app for is to log my food, and weight. There’s no point to using the free version of this app now. Time to find another app. If going backwards in progress and loosing users was ur goal, congratulations uve achieved it.Has completely gone off the rails for a money grab. Can’t even use the barcode scanner with out a subscription. I have used this app regularly for the past several years, every winter to keep an eye on my numbers. Not any more. Everything is behind the premium paywall. I briefly thought I would just grab the monthly sub. Like I have in the past. They raised that cost as well. Other good options out there, I only returned here because all my history is still available from years past. Time for something new:-)✌️

Update: Received a response just confirming what I had pointed out in my review. Prior data available ( quick add already entered food) and free members can not use the barcode scanner. Thanks for the confirmation.I’m so disappointed that this app has become garbage. $80/yr for stuff thats been free for the last 10 yrs feel like a rip off. You guys truly screwed up by moving the barcode scanner and macros under premium :/ not many ppl like it enough to continue to use the app now that it’s not as convenient. You were set apart from the rest, but not anymore.

ETA: In response to MyFitnessPal, yes I can look the items up and they will be in my history. This does NOT mean its equally as convenient as the barcode scanning as I don’t usually eat the same thing every single day/ week, plus some items are hard to find on the app. Your response to everyone’s complaints regarding the update is extraordinarily frustrating.",2,"Once great but look elsewhere if you are starting nowWould be nice to have access to the food database againJune 2022 Redesign 👎🏻Good until yesterdayThey will sell your info...Obnoxious Ads are ruining the AppGreedyWas good, now a rip offDisappointedOverpriced garbageUnhappy paid userLost my accountToo expensive for its own goodDon’t do the update!!a money grabAnother scummy company",Bandguy2014C.

Aside from the whole switcharoo they did with, arguably, the app’s best feature, the app was really good to me for the past almost 6 months that I used it. It made tracking my calories super easy and convenient. Until one of the most recent updates that took the scanning away. Thank you to the developers for the amount of time I spent tracking on this app. Deleting ✌🏽

Edit in response to the developers reply; More of a copy-paste than a genuine reply but regardless of that, the team fails to acknowledge why this app was great. Sure I can “go to my history of logged items” but that’s not the point lol people were more than happy to use the scanner anytime they’d like, regardless of wether the scan was saved already or not. We can also look up items but it’s not as convenient as straight up scanning.I too am very frustrated with taking the scan option away. Life is so busy as it is, we need the scan feature especially when grocery shopping. I think you should seriously consider at least making the price AFFORDABLE. $20 a MONTH? Most other apps are at more like $20 a year. And when you respond by telling us we can still log all our food by searching for Brand Name or food type or quick log from our history is ridiculous. Duh, we already know that!!!!!! That’s why we’re so mad that you took the scanner away because manually adding is a pain in the a**!!! And reminding us we can call customer service is not helping at all. I’m sure they aren’t going to give us the scanning option back or lower the price to something affordable. Instead of talking, DO SOMETHING FOR US, before we all jump ship 😡
UPDATE: Still wishing you would lower your price 😞I’ve used MyFitnessPal for a decade or more both with and without subscription. It has its ups and downs but the last couple are a dealbreaker for me.  It used to have a gps restaurant locator that made aging meals on the go so easy. That left but was still a great app mainly because of the barcode scanner. 
I was going to re up my subscription this year but two things I found really disappointing. 
1- just bought a brand new Apple Watch and thought that would make it easier to use. Unfortunately it doesn’t even display correctly but there’s nothing useful on the watch app anyway. Disappointing but still a great app I thought so I started to enter the days meals and came to the second disappointment. 
2- the barcode scanner is now only for premium users! Almost $100/year! That prompted me to look for other apps. There are a ton that do for free what MyFitnessPal used to do. I tried one and you know what I like it better. And the watch app works and does more as well. And it’s free!
See you later MyFitnessPal! 
I hope you do well with your new pay to play model. It doesn’t work for my on and off use. I probably will never use your service again paid or not. Unfortunate because I enjoyed having such a long history logged on your tracker.It seems that there were recent updates to the iphone app that make it harder to find foods you recently ate and add them fast. I'm sure it was supposed to be an improvement some how, but I actually have found in the last week or two that I cannot find my history as easily. It also seems as if the app has not changed my caloric allowance in a long time, and so I have started to lose momentum in weight loss. I can subtract my own number of calories to get momentum going again, but it seems like that is something the app was supposed to help us with. 
Steps also seem to be gaining 1/2 of what other research suggests for calories.  Not sure why. 

I have loved the app up until this point. I hope it will go back to it's strengths. I could be me doing something wrong, but I wanted to give honest feedback.I downloaded this app when I was 14 because I hated myself and wanted to look more like the other kids my age. I’m 19 now and have been logging on and off with this app for years. My best streak of logging was for 2 years. Your body is not meant to be in a calorie deficit for 2 years. My hair started falling out, I looked pale and gaunt. I’ve tried to stop logging and i can’t. I’m addicted. Food is just a number to me now. I can’t go out to eat, I can’t enjoy a night out without having a panic attack and trying to calculate what was in my meal. Obviously this is not the fault of the app itself but the idea of counting calories will stop you from following your natural hunger cues and give you a lifelong history of disordered eating. I wish I could go back and time and never start tracking my foodThe better iOS apps with premium versions offer a clear view of the product in the free version. MyFitnessPal succeeded, I guess. I entered the foods for my breakfast. The software found the foods and added the calories. For one brief moment I saw the total calories of my breakfast in a detailed history display. Then I clicked another menu. I decided to go back.  For 20 minutes I poked at all of the menus - of which there are a great many - and looked in the Help tab, but never found the simple display of what I had had for breakfast again. However, in the course of that 20 minutes I did see about 40 ads to subscribe for the premium version. I deleted the app.",1,PaywallMake things right for all the unhappy peopleUsed to be great.

I am vegetarian and I’d like to make sure that I’m getting what I need.  This app is great for that but I have some issue with some things due to my history of having eating disorders.  I don’t typically weigh myself but I do know my approximate weight because of doctor visits.  I put “maintain weight” and this app gave me a “goal” weight of 15lbs lighter than current weight.  I will note here that my current BMI (according to google) is 25, which is technically overweight, but I’m okay with that.  I am able to do what I want to do, and when I am NOT being told that I’m technically overweight, I usually like how I look.   I’m actually pretty upset about this, because I am not trying to lose weight actively because historically it’s caused me to lapse back into bad habits that are detrimental to my physical and mental health.  If there’s a way to remove that “goal” weight I’d appreciate if someone told me how to do so because looking at it is makes worried that I’ll take it to heart.This is a useful app for tracking progress. It’s a bit cumbersome on the exercise and Food/intake counters because it takes so long to find a matching workout / food. But for a free app - it definitely solves the tracking problem with multiple factors (unlike other free apps ) A bit Annoying that it refuses to reduce calories below 1200 even if you’re a very small , older woman and doesn’t give you the option decide whether or not you want exercise calories to be added to your daily count when you workout. So in the first weeks I was maintaining and started gaining until I realized what was going on. It also didn’t properly integrate with the weight gurus scale and I think it messed up the records because everything was working great before I “integrated” but now the history gets wiped out when I make changes in this app. Ugh! One very valuable feature is the macros calculator and the fact that you can control your percentages for your goals. Overall - a  good app definitely worth trying !I have used the app for several years primarily for my workouts and only a little for counting calories. The last couple updates have been very frustrating. All the data from my workout history disappeared along with all my exercises. I had to rebuild it all. A couple days ago, many of the things in my history reappeared so now I have duplicate exercises. All started with 1 set, 10 reps and 10 pounds.  I got it all worked out again. Today I went to workout. All of my history was 1 set, 10 reps and 10 pounds. How is this helpful when you can’t keep track of what you lifted and how many sets and reps the last time. I have to use the history for my workout because the workout section does not allow you to add your own exercises to a workout or arrange it to the order you desire. Frustrating.I have been using this app for many years. It was great to track food and seemed fairly accurate in calorie count as I was able to lose weight consistently by monitoring calories. The barcode scanner had a registry that far exceeded other apps, but the upgrade to making it a premium feature is absolute bull****. I’m not paying a ridiculous fee just to use the scanner. If the price was more affordable, maybe. But it really stinks that it used to be free and then was taken away. I also have found that the app kicks me out more, requiring me to log back in. My husbands account was somehow deleted all together so he had to start fresh with no history of his food preferences, weight loss, or recipes saved. I think the creators got a bit greedy. I used to recommend to my patients, but I don’t anymore.I’ve been using MFP for a while now. While the app has seen some marginal improvement, there seems to be a core feature being block by a subscription wall every time I use this app. I’m able to get the bare minimum done to count my calories and enter in recipes but nothing really stands out with this app anymore. 

Recently, I’ve noticed a lot more slowness/lag in navigating around the app and exception errors when trying to copy online recipes. After a recent update (not sure if it was iOS or the app) I can’t open the app. It just crashes and I have to go to the website to enter my info. The website is 10x worse than the app so this makes me less motivated in entering my info. 
EDIT: this has been resolved in the most recent app update. This did remind me to touch on my other grip. If you look at the app version history you'll find the same update every time. It would be great if they posted some actual info on what is fixed or updated in the app. 

If you’ve been using MFP before the under armor take over, then you might not care at this point to switch over. If you’re a new user, then you might want to check out other options as this one just seems to go further downhill.This app has the potential to be a great app, but they lost me by being too pushy with the premium. Navigating the free version of this app is like scrolling through a clickbait story. It felt like everything I clicked on was locked and turned in to a pop up ad. From what I gather, I have no use for the premium version but even if I did I wouldn’t purchase simply because of the aggressive marketing. There are other apps out there that are setup the way this one should be: free features are visible, premium are tucked away for you to use only if you choose to purchase the premium version. 

I’m also over everything charging for premium as a subscription when it’s passive income that should be a one time purchase.One of the ways to get people to be more compliant with logging food is to make it fast and easy. I absolutely HATE that you can’t choose which screen it defaults to when you open the app. I have premium and want to be on the diary page the first time I open it every time. Having premium, there’s not even a point to me having to be on the story page upon opening because it’s not like I see ads anyway. Also, please add a section where you can add notes. I want to track what foods keep me sufficiently full and how long so I can eat choose them more often. This app does so much and can’t even do something simple like that. Very disappointing.I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for about 4 months now, and recently it logged me out (which unfortunately happens fairly often). It then asked me if I wanted to update my goals. I said yes since I went from lightly active to moderately active. It then proceeded to erase all of my history - from every food diary the last 4 months to all the individual foods that I logged so that I have to go back to barcoding all the foods I had been eating. I have loved the app, but this made me livid. I have had stomach issues in the past, and logging and noting changes in my health has been very important to me and in just a second, I lost all of it.

It links to Garmin Connect for integrating exercise calories into the overall balance for the day. You can scan barcodes for food  items for easier logging. You can select items from your history of previous entries (great for frequently eaten foods). You can text search for foods, which accesses an enormous list of prior entries that I assume have been entered or scanned by other users. So why only four stars? My only peeve with the program is that it doesn’t seem to let users edit the serving size for many items, beyond being able to select from a too often extremely limited and sometimes arbitrary mix of imperial/metric/liquid/solid measures. The options presented vary widely from item to item, with little apparent logic. The best solution I have is to try to find items that use 1g as a serving size and then list the number of grams for that day’s serving as the number of servings for that entry. Since I’m using a food scale, that works for me. Seems a better solution would be to allow users to edit any food item to select from a full complement of serving sizes (or to just directly enter the desired serving size using the keyboard). Or just provide 1g as a choice in all cases (or at least all solid cases). In any case, I love and recommend the app, with the measurement detail being my only pet peeve.",0,Great app but could use more user control of selecting or defining serving sizes,georg-o,MyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,250,has_narrative,39

However, with the upgrade to iOS 11 I lost 18 months of weight data and progress photos.  Big loss after investing in the premium service and lots of time logging my progress.  The company offered no support and no credit offer.  Seems they should have a better solution for backing up user data and reimporting after mishaps.  Seems also they should have tested the app with the iOS 11 update process.  My one star is for the poor data storage and recovery and for the poor customer service.  Update: support got back to me with the recommendation to reinstall and the history including pictures were restored.  Better solution this time so app stars increased to three.  Still cumbersome solution and it took six support emails and two different support reps to get to this.  Would have done it myself except the app delete message said that all data would be deleted.I’ve loved this website since probably 2011 maybe sooner and it has a history of wanting to help people is astounding. I’ve watch this site grow into having a lot of media attention and a lot of success which is great. But lately, something has changed and I’m disappointed.... lots of bots/fake accounts set up that are not real people and all the moderators seem to have disappeared. Also, when you add food items to your diary it doesn’t appear so if you’re not careful you’re getting a little bit of trouble with that. I’m probably going to start looking for a paid app that works better. I’ve tried the premium plan as well just in case they do a better job with people who are upgraded but it doesn’t make a difference.I’m a 45 y/o woman.

I loved the app before, but love it even more with the Premium features! I am usually a non-believer that Premium changes much, but it has helped me structure and track my goals more closely. I especially like the freedom to adjust my macronutrients by gram, and to see the overview of my meal entries in grams, not percentages. I have been reverse dieting for about a year, so I appreciate that the app doesn’t see weight gain as bad, and rather reports it just as the stat it is. Many other apps like this are weight loss-focused, so I appreciate MFP’s neutral stance on the goals people may have.
This app overall has been awesome to use. I would recommend it to anyone, and I will keep using it myself for the foreseeable future.

My fave feature is the ability to scan products and instantly see the calories and other details. It helps me make wiser feeding choices and stick to my caloric goals for the day. Also when I go over my daily caloric limit, I work out, input the details on the app and balance out the calories so I'm always on track. I've been fasting intermittently for a week now and I use this app to track and document my feeding. So far I've lost 3.2kg by sticking to under 1200 calories daily. Summary of the story, MyFitnessPal is awesome 💃To make a long story short - I’m overweight and want to get healthier (ie skinner) and got this as a calorie tracker. For which it was awesome. Realistic and intuitive search options that actually make it easy to track your choices. Even better (which frankly was more than I expected) you can enter in recipes and it calculates  everything. Like easily enter home cooked meals so you can keep track of these cheapies methods of weight loss. 

Sure this app doesn’t fix my weight loss problem but it’s defiantly pulling its weightI came into issues on my first day of starting my new fitness program and needing to use this app. It took hours to get it resolved. I was stressing out, because it was my first day of my program and I needed this app. It did get resolved though. Help will come, you just might need to wait longer than you may like. However, the actual is fantastic, and I’m for sure getting the premium membership. I would like to see the ability to save a list of foods that I typically eat. You can view your history, but only so far.",0,Highly recommend this appAwesome results (free version)Free Version is actually helpfulGreat,PettownluvacognaeBellereaderbmhopper,MyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie CounterMyFitness Pal Calorie Counter,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,486,has_narrative,39

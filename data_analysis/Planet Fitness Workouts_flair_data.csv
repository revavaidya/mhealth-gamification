To start March, my check-in did not register last night either. The front desk makes a note in your acct that you were “not fully checked in” and missing points, but you never get them. Moreover, Perksville never responds to concerns. Their auto-reply only states that they are experiencing high volume, so if you lose points, it will never resolve. 

I spent two hours in club, weightlifting, treadmill, and massage. I checked into the club AND the massage table, and not one check-in registered my presence in club or awarded my 5 points! Yeah, I get my workout, but I want my t-shirts! Incentive programs need to work. I am Black Card member and can appreciate the cost of PF as compared to other gyms, but I have a free gym option on the AF Base that has a cardio room and a weight room with power racks. In PF, I am paying for convenience and the “brand” to work. 
Call me lame, but perks often compel me to stop by the gym and “actively” recover. 
Please debug your Perks.You have to log in to about 4 or 5 different screens within this app. And once you finally do that, you don't really get any functionality. PF Store takes you to the web page. Can't manage points. Can't manage your account. You can ""track"" workouts, but the data is worthless. 

The ONLY thing this app provides is the ability to have your membership barcode on your phone. That's it. Everything else you can get to more easily from your internet app on your phone.It just seems like you don’t really want people to use the app.

Why can’t I use the app as an active log of activity at PF. Why do I not see how many days of the week and for how long i was at PF. The QR should post on a calendar for the activity scanned for us to track progress. Maybe I need to see what time I last tanned because there is a 24 hour restriction. Why can’t I track my points and see how many points for each product.I love my planet fitness. I do. It's too bad the only thing this app is good for is not carrying around the key tag. I have no way of recording my actual workouts with it. There is no place to take notes to record my weight lifting activities.
I would say it might be useful to keep track of reward points but those are pretty useless since I was never given points for the 3 friends I referred and who named me as their referral. Maybe that can only be done through the app too. Who knows.The new update has eliminated the check in points. It is not user friendly. Bring back the old app or at least fix this one! I’ve lost all my check in points. There’s no longer a fitness tracker. Not happy about this. I hope the developers are paying attention.",0,Nef.

But the PF app USED to still track the points. 
If a separate entity is managing points we don’t need to see all of what is going on under the hood to make it all work, there should still be a way to have the points show up in the app. It’s not rocket science, figure it out.
The points tracking was primarily what I used the app for, it was there and  then removed. 2/5, would be a 1/5 but the extra point (pun intended) is for the effort with everything else there that looks great but I don’t use.I mainly only use this app for checking in and seeing how crowded the gym is. For those cases, it works great but the Apple Watch companion app is frustrating so I have to dock points.

On paper, it should let me check in without whipping out my phone but I’m repeatedly getting a “Connection expired” error - forcing me to use my phone anyways. I’ve also encountered another weird problem where it doesn’t recognize the orientation of my watch and flips the display upside down. 

I was willing to cut some slack because the Watch app is new-ish but please dedicate your team to squashing these bugs.Seems the new version (8.0 has less capability than the previous: cant see reward points, can’t customize calories burned when I load a new exercise.

The fitness target is kind of lame. All you do is hit a circle and theirs no tips or anything thst pops up afterwards. There’s just a lot of spam and sell points but the usefulness is lack luster.The new update does not have a rewards points tracker anymore. I was looking forward to maybe earning a point or two through completion of the new workout videos on the app. Will update my review once the point system is at least added back to the app so I can keep up with how many points I have.

The key tag for the Apple Watch dose not work at all and within the app should go with the workout you do for a plan. It would be nice to open the app say I want to increase muscle index, loose weight, or even yoga and automatically come up with a schedule of how many reps weight and set goals without watching a video, according to your weight height and level you choose. 

At home or in gym and again with the watch please include this to Apple Watch with time frames and plans it would be much better then a video that you can barely see when your at the gym all you have is a 2x5” screen nothing to connect too and a million other ppl around. Also like Dunkin’ Donuts or gas stations apps should be points to encourage more time at the gym for a free shirt towels drinks etc instead of discounts only to a lot of places most people don’t care for. Setting goals and point system would be niceThe app works well- it’s intuitive and well designed. Not hard to find your way around. I only have a few recommendations/requests:

1. I would love if it synced with Apple Health. At this point, it seems a bit silly to have a health tracker app that doesn’t sync with your health app on your phone. Could we make that a priority?

2. Include Planet Perks inside the app. It makes sense to me, maybe under the profile button, to have a tab or area that tells you how many planet perk points you have earned. 

3. For the different exercises that you can log, can we change the data on non-cardio exercises, so that it doesn’t log minutes spent, but sets and reps instead? It doesn’t make much sense to log the amount of minutes I spent bench pressing, instead of the sets and reps.

Super equipment, very clean, and never too crowded. Love the experience at the gym. Pros - it will track when I’ve checked into the gym - it will generate a QR that allows me to check in at the desk Cons - it wont display utilization of the PF black card amenities such as tanning booth, massage chairs, etc… - it wont record my activity without me manually entering the information - it doesn't interface with the Activity App on my iPhone (which will automatically record my activity) - the apple watch’s PF app functionality is worthless, doesn't work for check-in, and gives me a message to have my iPhone in close proximity. (I have a cellular enabled apple watch and would like to not have to carry my iPhone into the gym). I received the following response to this review. Really makes me wonder if the developer really knows what they are doing. There is a PF app that installs on my watch with the installation of the PF app on my iPhone. 

 Dear THOMAS, Planet Fitness Holdings, LLC responded to your review of Planet Fitness Workouts Planet Fitness Holdings, LLC ""Thank you for sharing this with us! Currently, our app does not support third peripherals such as the Apple Watch. We thank you for the feedback as we continue to grow the PF mobile app! ""I am not going to go into much detail, no need in repeating what’s already been said in the last week or so about the recent update. Tons of 1 star reviews lately and angry customers say it all.  I just hope someone important at Planet Fitness is paying attention to the their unhappy customers, because it is clearly obvious the redesigned app was created by people who don’t  value customer feedback, customer service, ease of use and the ability to capture workout data.  This new app make me think it was created by people who never stepped one foot into a gym.  Nor did they think it was important to seek out the opinion of the folks who do.  The post release tech support has been nothing but insulting to the customer as well.  Hey folks this episode let’s you know what Planet Fitness thinks of you......Not Much.....just keep sending in your $10 or $20 a month and keep quiet.Like many others I was hoping to not bring my phone into the gym since the developer has enabled Apple Watch support to display your club pass. Unfortunately, the Apple Watch app does not function without your phone being nearby and connected. I find it appalling that in response to this feedback, the developer has replied to multiple reviews saying, “Currently, the PF Mobile App does not support third-party peripherals such as the Apple Watch.“ If the app doesn’t support the Apple Watch, why did you develop and include Apple Watch functionality into the app? I hope the devs realize this answer makes no sense whatsoever. Please add functionality into the Watch app to access the club pass over the internet instead of requiring the phone to be nearby.I like the look of new app. Thought it would be great till I went to log my interval treadmill work out. It’s horrible! Please take this feedback and the many others I reviewed and fix this. This app has such potential. You need to add treadmill back in and account for interval training across all equipment. Just putting intensity and time of workout doesn’t do the job especially when the equipment doesn’t show the intensity choices you have listed! Also removing the capture feature was a bad idea. But adding workout was great.Update.  Never works.  Local can’t help.  No one cares. Junk!!!!!!

It works maybe 10% of the time has nothing to do with my Wi-Fi has nothing to do with the local Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi at planet fitness. The app continuously crashes you can delete it add it again delete it add it again it will not matter I provided feedback/resolution to the app via Planet Fitness with no corrections. Therefore I can never use the app for anythingI had two requests; sync with iOS health and activities and show the a history  of payments or pending payment.  

For both I received the same answer, that the app had a bug and it is now fixed.  Of course it does not sync with iOS and of course it does not show the payment history.  

Does anyone read the feedback?  It is very condescending.  Sad.I’m a member. Went 5 times a week. Now I can’t get a simple answer, or any feedback at all. My only question is are the rates going up once the gym opens up. That’s all. Completely ignored. Very direct and simple question and meaningful to alot of people. I still get nothing. No answer.

I only use this app to check into the gym and since it isn’t optimized even the slightest it takes forever to even load and you have several screens to go through just to get to your “keychain” login.  You can park furthest away in the parking lot and start trying to load the second you leave your car and it still won’t get to it by the time you reach the front desk.  Also, it dumbly needs an internet connection where they could have made your keychain static and the approval for it go through the front desk computers when you scan in.  But noooo it has to be the slow and hard way.   And on top of that the terrible WiFi provided by the gym logs you out constantly so if you show up to start your workout and you get close enough to the gym to grab their WiFi it blocks your keychain from loading as you’re on the WiFi but not connected to the internet because you have to sign in over and over every single time.  So you have to either forget their network every time or go through their even slower sign in process just to not be interrupted while trying to access your keychain all so you can just scan in to begin your workout.  Ridiculous.  Atrocious setup.  Negative stars for this app and the geniuses who came up with this 1990 AOL level sign on process.I haven’t been able to use the app in four months. Support has been a joke continually. I get bounced around between 3 to 4 different help people and I’ve had over 20 people talk to me with no actual answer.

They’ll ask about your operating system, if you have a  VPN (and if it’s on), if you tried re-download it, and uninstalling it, and if your operating systems up-to-date. All that is true for me and they still don’t know what’s wrong with it. I continually get messages like “I will get back to you soon” and it will be weeks later until I have to contact them and start the process all over again.

they had me repeatedly say that I can get support in the app which isn’t true since I can’t actually get to the screen where support is an option. Also support provided with app section, just lead you back to either the planet fitness social marketing team or social media team. Not the actual app support with a developer.My Planet Fitness app always worked fine until 2 updates ago. Now nothing will load. It just says “Oops, make sure there is an internet connection”, which there is a strong one. I submitted a question asking for help on the Planet Fitness website. I received a canned text instructing me to do what I had already done, such as uninstall and reload the app, which I’ve done several times. No one ever contacted me. I sent another message. Received the same canned text message and no one ever contacted me. No way to reach a live representative. I went into the Planet Fitness gym in Rooney Ranch in Oro Valley, AZ and asked to speak with a live customer service representative. They sent an email for me. Never heard from anyone. I went in again, and again they sent a message for me. Again, never heard from anyone. I’m very disappointed in the complete lack of customer service from Planet Fitness.I’ve just signed up for a membership today, and this app already makes me want to cancel my membership. It’s so slow to download. Each time I tried logging in, it kept telling me, “oops, connection failure.” No matter many times I’ve restart the app and my phone, it keeps giving the same error, and I cannot log in. This is the worst app. Do better planet fitness, not impressed.

Update:
The app is still not working for me. I’ve deleted it and redownloaded it, and it is still giving me the same error message. I've followed the steps, and it still doesn't work. This is so frustrating. This app needs significant improvement; this has been such a horrible experience.Are you kidding me? Not only have you made the app so much worse than before but you destroyed people’s workout histories! I have been frequenting your gyms for 4 years now and using the app most of that time, all of my workout history, and such is now gone! No longer can i snap a screen and have it directly! No longer can i record calorie counts! This is total crap! Not everyone who uses your gyms are narcissistic and needing attention through social media but that is all your concerned about! Lastly, you need to stop being deceitful on about this app, look at your recent reviews and you will see the majority of your users are as angry about this app as  I am!The app is very slow, has too much advertising and self promotion. I would much rather have a card or tag👎

It was suggested that clearing the app cache might help the slow response, but it did not.  It still takes a long time to retrieve my membership information and it often doesn’t find it the first time, saying that it does not have connection to the internet, and I have enabled access to cellular data.  I would still rather have a physical card.  This app is just a way to self promote and attempt to sell products and services.  I am not a fan!Why have an app measurement of veiled that’s literally never accurate? At my club it never has more than 3 bars, even when almost every single piece of equipment is taken when you take “Social Fitnessing “ into consideration... which you need to these days. Right now is pretty dead in here and there are rightfully 2 bars, but yesterday PACKED when I left and it had 3 bars.

Watch functionality still blows. I still have to pull up the barcode on my phone to get it to connect to my watch. What’s the point then? 

Suggestion for Black Card Club: schedule chairs and booths from the appI have iOS 15.5 and an 11 pro max  and the app will not work on my phone. For four days now it just keeps saying “oops connection failure”. I’ve deleted the app and re-installed it, turned my phone off and back on, connected to my WiFi at home, connected to the WiFi at the gym, tried using cellular and this app will not open on my phone. Every other app on my phone works, and nothing is wrong with my connection or my phone.  I keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app hoping for an update, but nothing works.I have deleted & reinstalled this app 100 times trying to fix it’s shortcomings to no avail. 

It constantly fails to load my account info & login barcode. The only thing this app is good at is giving me a message that reads - Opps, failed to load. Please check connection & try again. I can have all 4 service bars, be connected via wifi, doesn’t matter; always fails to load & the same stupid message . 

Note to PF, if you’re going to replace key fob with digital key (I’m all for it, btw) but fix the bugs in the app!!!!!Unfortunately, Planet Fitness no longer has key tags to scan in when entering the gym, so the app is the only option. It's been over a week and my app won’t even load. I’ve updated my phone and the app and it never loads. I’ve made sure that my connection was strong, and it still will not load to my membership barcode. No matter where I go, I cannot access my membership. It's frustrating and kinda disappointing considering I pay $24 a month to use this gym.I gave this app a review as a new customer back in September 2022.  I received the suggestions from the developer.  Tried them all.  Same problem.  Still cannot log in.  I do see the new logo, still get same error message.  I am on the Wi-Fi AT MY HOUSE.  BY MYSELF.  Still tells me there’s a connection issue and to make sure I’m connected to a Wi-Fi signal.

I have done everything I know how to do.  Everything I was told to do.  Nothing.  Very VERY disappointed with this app.I have downloaded this app, deleted it, restarted my phone, and downloaded it again several times just to get a response of “Oops! Connection Failure”. I have an iPhone 12 and 5G service-there is no failure to connect on my end. Please fix this issue soon so I can check in without having to yell at anyone for not understanding they need to check me in with my club number since my home club is completely infested with toxic mold (Gunn Hwy in Tampa) for which I am calling the Fl Department of Health about tomorrow.I updated the app back in July and now all I get is a spinning circle with “Retrieving your membership” then a “check your network connection.” I’ve deleted, reloaded, updated again, and nothing! I’ve tried following the thin thread of customer service for the app, which tells me to check with my local PF people—who are completely unaware of how to deal with app issues. Vicious circle of absolutely no help. The app is useless now.I just want to get into the gym & your app makes it impossible. All my other apps work & download without a problem relying on the same internet connection, yet whenever I try even using the app it tells me no connection. I’ve deleted & Downloaded it again numerous times & still no solution. Get your app together because the gym won’t let me in unless it works & even connected to the gyms WiFi, no connectionI deleted and re-downloaded the Planet Fitness in an attempt to see if that would fix the issue of the app not loading, but the app still currently is stuck on the “Retrieving Membership” page. After seeing to be stuck on the loading symbol, it then shows a message that reads “Oops! Connection Failure: Please check that you have a functioning connection to an internet service.”This app doesn’t load up. It just shows the loading screen and it says “ Connection Failure
Please check that you have a functioning connection to an internet service. Try again “ when I’m on my home WiFi. Also since my I can login, sometimes the jerks at planet fitness are to lazy to log me in by my phone number. If you can fix this problem that would be amazing!!The app only works sometimes.  Like right now, it starts off, Loading, You deserve a second for yourself.  Then it goes to the next message, Retrieving membership, and it just spins for about 3 minutes then it gives an error page that reads, Connection Failure, Please check that you have a functioning connection to an internet service.

I have a connection with an internet service.  All of my streaming apps and streaming devices are all working fine.  

I have uninstalled the app and power reset my iPhone, then reinstalled the app.  Same problem.  I have also reset my password on the web base site, same problem.

Please fix this issue right away.  Thank you.Just got an iPhone today, went to download planet fitness app to workout. Won’t even load! Keeps saying “connection issue” even though I’ve validated my connection. Restarted my iPhone 3 times. Completely uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. Nada. No way to submit a report on this either that I could see to fix. How am I supposed to workout if I can’t sign in thanks to a broken app? Please help!I never bring my phone into the gym. I only wear my watch with a cellular connection. I’ve never had a problem until today but I’ve deleted the app, redownloaded, and nothing. I am so freaking sick of all these apps that claim to do something, but then don’t even come close to the claims… just constantly being told “it’s an error we are working on”… seriously? Zero starsI still haven’t been able to open the app, I get a “connection error” message even though I’ve tried it on several different Wi-Fis now as well as using mobile data. I’ve tried everything that I can find on Google about the problem and nothing has worked, I’ve just been avoiding going to the gym until I can get the app to work.For several weeks the app hasn’t gone beyond the loading page, comes up w “internet connection issues” message yet no internet connection issue w phone. Phone updated, app re-downloaded several times, and App Store link to App Support does not lead to anywhere that provides tech support. Front desk not always staffed for check in.I like what this app has to offer, but lately, every time I open it, it takes forever for anything to load, and then it times out and I have to start over. Twice now when using the wifi at the club, the app has said ""no internet connection"", when my phone clearly shows that it's connected to wifi. I've had to switch wifi off to get the app to even open to record a workout.They want you out workouts and schedule things on the app, then the app never works. Gives Connection issues error says to check internet connection. Obviously my phone is having no connection issue since every other app/browser works. Really wish they would just back to key chain scanners.Like others have mentioned, the app recently stopped working. It'll say ""Retrieving Membership"" for a split second then ""Connection Failure."" That's it. That's the entire app now. 

The directions the developer has given in response to other reviews changed nothing. I've made sure it's updated and deleted/reinstalled, and it won't get past the opening screen.I cannot get the app to even open. It just keeps telling me that there’s a connection issue even though I have good WiFi connection. I tried downloading it on my iPad and it works just fine but I can’t lug my iPad with me every time I need to work out. I’ve deleted and reinstalled that app several times and it still won’t load. I have an iPhone 13 Pro with IOS 16.The app worked fine for awhile, and now I can’t log in at all. It says “oops. Connection failure” every time I try to open the app. So not only can I not use any of the features in the app, I can’t even sign into the gym! I have to go there and see if they can give me a card instead of using this app or else I’ll have to cancel my membership.I have downloaded and downloaded the app numerous times. Restarted my phone. Connected to Wi-Fi and data for a week now and still have been unable to open the app on my phone. It loads and loads and then tells me to check connection. There is nothing wrong with my phone. The app has a glitch and it’s been unresolved.I don't what they did. This app used to work. But now when I try to do anything with it it just says no internet connection. I obviously do because my browser and other apps work fine. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it and now I can't even log in because it says 'no internet connection' every time. I guess I'll record my results with another app.I’ve been attempting to login to the app for the past few days and I keep getting connection error and the loading circle.  I have deleted the app numerous times.  I can get into every other app I have perfectly so it has nothing to do with internet connection as the pop up states.  Please fix!Even after updating the app will not launch continuing to give me an error message.  The error always says connection failure and to check my service.  I have both wifi and cellular so there is no issue on my side.  Haven’t been able to open the app in months.Always getting a connection error even when the internet either WiFi or through mobile data are working perfectly. Suspecting that it may have to do with the privacy setting and VPN on my iPhone. I’m not about to turn off those so you can mine my data.Ive deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times, updated phone, iCloud, deleted iCloud, deleted data, made a new App Store account to refresh the app. Still won’t work and says “check your connection” I gave up and deleted the app. Hasn’t worked in two months.Two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning properly. When I try to check in, it spins and spins and I get a connection error.  Despite recent update no change in connection error. Tried to “report a problem” but it doesn’t  address this problem.For about 3weeks I have not been able to log into my account at all to set up personal training sessions. It continues to clock and then it gives me an error message to make sure I have a functioning connection to an internet. I do and it only happens to planet fitness app.No matter how many times I uninstall and redownload, no matter my data connection the app will not open. Worked fine up until a few months ago. All of my other apps continue to work as they always have.The current version of this application needs bug fix. Though the mobile is connected to WiFi and have cellular mobile data the app as soon as it opens pops up a connection failure message.Got a new phone.  Tried to redownload the app and it says “loading you deserve a second for yourself.”   Then it says “retrieving membership.”  Then it says connection failure.  I have internet but app will not load and will not let me resign in.I’m having a lot of trouble opening the app lately. It keeps telling me to check my WiFi connection which is fine. I would appreciate help. Btw your link for app support is just to the PF website and I found nothing to assist me thereI have tried offloading this app and deleting an reinstalling about 5 times and nothing makes this app work.

It just freezes and will occasionally report “connection error” when loading.

Seriously, fix your app!This app is completely useless. It worked one time but all it gives me now is “connection error”

I’ve tried everything I’ve read online to fix it. I check in with the front desk using my phone number every time.Works perfect on my old iPhone XR running iOS 15.5, but pops an error on my current iPhone 13 Pro Max running iOS 16.1 trying to retrieve membership, then indicates there is no Internet connection.  Have tried offloading app, complete reinstall of app, no change in behavior.All other apps work fine with my Wi-Fi, but this app always says I have no connection.  I have the latest version installed which was released today.  Crowd meter also hasn’t worked.  Both issues ongoing for months now.The app was working until Tuesday. It stopped loading. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled but it still will not load. I have restarted my iPhone and no luck.  I am using a fiber Wi-Fi connection and it just says it is loading.I have deleted and reloaded this app 4 times. It will not open. All I get is a connection failure message telling me to connect to an internet. I have internet and every other app on my phone works. This app needs fixed!can’t open the app, saying i don’t have connection even though my wifi & data are fine. nothing else on my phone is having issues. ): tried w/o wifi, tried restarting my phone a bunch & redos loading a bunch. it finally will let me access my account but i still can’t check in. my location refuses to give out cards if you have a smart phone so i have to be manually checked in every time. bummer.For the past several weeks, the app simply won’t load. Telling me to check internet connection… I’ve tried deleting the app and offloading the app. Nothing has worked; it never connects.For anyone experiencing “connection issues” while using the app, turn off your Wi-Fi connection even if it’s functioning. Just verified at least for me, that it remedied my connection problem to even login to the app",10,Goodcupcakesash999399elhoosierHelps to concentratejnsprengFlatheadwilsonmommomflAkbanrygraytimMjforever101KenneishaTamberxxduhGaley25tuso94PilgrimCharlie86Robert 1998 civicTinaboppJWP4038JudsonLinda KamaihnyahooBrandianna4769SoggywolfmancarefulresolveMoriah116school mom to 4Tokyo901scdude5MyThoughtsMyRightFlybabymommaiam callenBaleixo23jphill2yo4luvCarmena_camWajid Ali MohammeddjsjhshahwheucuixkzjwhdhuxjsksSad mad fanScottSeattlejdhdienxndurkzillaAMF app reviewgallonbotdeb with dogssynthQKvothe702JakeStar79,"Terrible, terrible, terrible appBe grateful if it worksApp upgrade failure; lack of customer serviceJust TerribleWhat a joke!UselessTerrible crowd-o-meter, Apple Watch functionality“Connection Failure” for five days nowCONSTANT LOAD FAILURESApp Won’t Load[Update] Can’t log in.

The gym (if you can call it that) is another story. This whole judgment free zone is laughable. People go to a gym to get in shape and develop muscle. If I happen to look better than a majority of the people in there and that is intimidating to you, that’s your problem. Work out harder! Planet fitness is merely a place to hang out and pretend your working out. What I find really funny is the training coaches in the app. In order to look like the Main guy in their introduction video you would need to conduct workouts that would violate their policies. Heaven forbid you start pushing some weight that makes you grunt….. violation. Drop a weight at the end of a set….. violation. I even had a guest that was asked to leave because of his muscular build. They said he would be intimidating to member’s. If your simply liking for a place to socialize and get a tan okay. Are you serious about getting fit and looking good? Go somewhere elseAt least once a week I’ll have problems with the app. I open the app as I get out of my car so my barcode is ready to be scanned as soon as I reach the front desk. Some days I’ll open the app, get out of my car, walk through the entire parking lot, into the front doors, and up to the front desk and the app still isn’t loaded. Today I was standing at the front desk for like two minutes straight waiting for it to load. I would try clearing it out and reopening it but that never works. It’s not my connection because my iPhone shows full signal 5g. I have an iPhone 13 Pro so I don’t understand why this app is so slowHaven’t used the app in a couple months prior to today but one of the recent updates seems to have broken the app.
I kept getting connection errors at launch and  when checking to see if it needed an update, I noticed another review with a developer reply suggesting to try without the WiFi turned on.
I turned off the WiFi and the app launched without issue, turned WiFi back on while in the app and started getting connection errors againI mainly only use this app for checking in and seeing how crowded the gym is. For those cases, it works great but the Apple Watch companion app is frustrating so I have to dock points.

On paper, it should let me check in without whipping out my phone but I’m repeatedly getting a “Connection expired” error - forcing me to use my phone anyways. I’ve also encountered another weird problem where it doesn’t recognize the orientation of my watch and flips the display upside down. 

I was willing to cut some slack because the Watch app is new-ish but please dedicate your team to squashing these bugs.I downloaded this app a couple days ago. It worked fine. Then I decided to try the guest feature and kept getting an error. After many tries, it finally worked. Today I tried accessing the feature to see how busy the gym is, got an error. Tried accessing the guest feature again, error. Tried many times. Didn’t work. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now it says connection error with zero access to my membership or keycard. Very disappointed.I recently joined planet fitness and it was fine for about 3 weeks, after a while the app started buggin out. Everytime I try to log in it says “connection failure” I’m new to gym so idk if I can just walk in and give them my number or something since I can’t use the app? I haven’t been to the gym bc of this annoying bug! PLEASE fix it!!I’m genuinely getting tired with the internet connection of this app. Whenever I open the app, it tells me that it cannot connect to the internet when all the other apps can. I even tried rebooting my device and re-installing the app itself, yet the problem is still there.I’ve been trying for 3 weeks now to get into my account and it doesn’t work. I keep getting a message blaming it on my internet connection even though this is the only app that doesn’t work. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled it so many times. Hopefully, they fix it.I love planet fitness but the app not so much. Every time I open the app it just swirls says retrieving membership then after a few minutes it will say connection failure. I have great internet. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Nothing is working. Please fix this.The app worked when I first joined pf a couple of years ago but now it won’t open. I have connection but the circle just spins and the app won’t open. I’ve deleted the all and reinstalled with the same results.Can’t open app over cellular data; it takes forever to load until finally it says check connection.

The crowd meter is nice to have and the ability to check in with your phone. It could be way cooler though if there were a calendar feature that showed which days you checked in, allowed you to plan for gym days, and had any classes/special events on it that you can click and sign up for. Another cool feature could be to add a social forum of sorts for people who attend that gym can message/help/encourage each other to show up. Just a thought. The app is kinda just boring as is.My boyfriend and his brother both have Samsung and their app works just fine. I however, can’t even login.

It fits the judgement free zone, mostly machine gym and the kind of lifting that goes on there.  It has videos built in to explain things.  It lets you log and record your progress.

Unbelievably, my worst fear confirmed, the app no longer has the “treadmill” option, and they have also “discontinued” the snap a workout feature. That feature was so helpful for me tracking my fitness history. 

But ok, I have to enter manually now, I could reluctantly accept that. Then I learned that to add insult to injury, you can only use the “walking” option as the closest thing to treadmill, and there you can only log your speed and minutes, not your calories or incline. From reading reviews, I learned the super buried feature where if you enter your height and weight, it will calculate the calories, however without the incline info, the calculation is way off. 

Friends, I feel bad saying this but this update is *terrible* — I have never regretted updating an app on this level. The old version was ugly, but it was super useful, and i used it a lot for a very important part of my life. The new version is useless to me. I have been an iphone user since 2008, and I this is the first time i can remember writing any app review. I can only hope you can work quickly to restore needed features to your paying customers.UPDATE: Per the developer’s response to my original review, I have opened two different support tickets from within the app and have yet to receive a single response. Their canned replies here seem just to make it appear they are listening. 

ORIGINAL:
The newest version of the app took away the one thing I was actually using it for, tracking distances of my various workouts. 

Now when you record a workout all you are entering is the time. There is no field to enter distance. So all the entries I had for the entire year, leading up to when it silently updated on my phone are now lost. 

Additionally, when you do enter the time of your workout, it defaults the Calories calculation (which is ALWAYS much lower than what the specific machine calculated) but no longer gives you a way to override the calculation. Previously you could override it with what was displayed on the machine. 

Also there is no way to see summaries of previous months/year to date/... beyond the current month (August as of this review). 

Because of this change the only thing I will prob end up using the app for is to display my ID card to get in the door. 

As a software developer I appreciate the need for updates but not when you take away basic functionality that people might be using.

A definite step backwards.This new update is horrendous! It deleted some of my most recent workout entries, and when I tried to record a new workout, it only allowed me to enter the time spent on the machine, you can’t enter the calories or distance anymore. What a terrible and inaccurate way of keeping track of workouts now. Plus it was so hard to find where to record your workout. AND logging into the app was such a hassle! They had to email me a password reset which apparently was done to all previous app users and the reset email took forever! I got so upset at with all this I just deleted it. You’re better off using any other fitness tracking app. Such a shame that they updated the app to be less user-friendly. I hope they bring back the old features. Otherwise, I won’t be downloading again.I just joined planet fitness. I was really excited to download the app, enter the reps, etc. for each machine I used. I was also excited to plug in the numbers from my treadmill exercise to track my progress. There is absolutely no way to do this. You can click “add activity,” but the list is extremely bare. There’s no way to specifically add each exercise machine, reps, number of mins, pace, etc. Lame app. Will definitely be deleting my app acct and looking for a more robust tracking app for my progress. 

Don’t bother downloading. Look for a different app with better capabilities for tracking purposes. I honestly don’t know what the point of this app is. The only positive is that it shows a video of how it should look when you use each exercise machine. Not enough to take up space on my phone.Prior to the update the user interface for tracking your personal progress was the first thing you saw…it was presented on a sort of meter/chart…now its the last thing you see when you open the app and they removed the progress/goal meter…also the way the app is averaging out your progress is so inaccurate almost as if they didn’t account for the average amount of recommended sleep people NEED. Like they are averaging everything out based on a 24 hour period with no sleep…wth? I go to the gym every day for over 60 minutes plus at a time…I'm sure to record my own data accurately…yet some how i average out at 20 minutes of exercise a day…prior to the update I averaged 55 minutes a day with no change in my routine..make it make sense!I seriously regret updating.  PF decided to go with pretty over function. The new app is no longer associated with what is in the gym and is now trying to be a more general fitness app.  In the process features like “snap-a-workout” or even just accurately tracking walking on a treadmill has been lost.  What a terrible move by PF to ruin what they had.

The common refrain from the developers is either go online or that has been discontinued.  Both of which scream “we elected to make the App less useful”.  Further the update history clearly shows the deployment of this version was rushed and not fully tested.  The customer response to the changes screams that this version is an outright failure.  Wow how short-sighted of PF.I hate the update. The only reason I used the app was to log my cardio. I used to be able to manually enter the distance, time and calories. You can no longer enter calories burned. Yes you can update your height and weight and that estimates calories burned but it doesn’t take into consideration the incline of the treadmill. I walk/jog with the maximum incline possible which is 15 at PF. I also change the speed throughout my workout. The new app doesn’t take any of this into consideration. Looking for a new cardio tracking app that lets you manually put in calories burned, time, and distance because I like to keep track of my cardio sessions and this helps me track my improvement. Very disappointed in the “update.”Return to the prior version!
This one takes away the only part I used (accurate tracking) and replaced with activity approximations and exercise videos I can see on endless other apps and videos. Didn’t want to believe the bad reviews and figured they were just malcontents. Alas, they were right.

I received a reply from the developer acknowledging that the activity entry by photograph is no longer available, but that activity can still be entered. Apparently the developer has never tried to enter a work out because they would see that it sorely lacks the ability to enter variables of importance. If I vary my pace on a treadmill I cannot accurately enter that activity.This app needs improvement, along with the customer services supporting this app. The purpose is to use it for tracking your workouts, and you can even save your membership card. 
I work at an IT company and feel that the initial set up of my account was incomplete. This has caused a looping effect where I have an account yet I can’t access it. The customer service line is slow to respond and I have yet in my many complaints had any opportunity to speak with a live person. They just reset the password (which is not the issue) and close my ticket.
I have sense deleted that app and do t recommend it for use to anyone else.You’ve removed the 2 most useful features for me — the photo capture of my workouts and weekly/monthly/yearly tracking of miles and calories burned. Why??? Based on other reviews, others found these same features really useful, too. For me, the app now has little value to me — I can just take a photo and add the data to a spreadsheet at home. Please restore the old features in your next update!

Also, the calorie tracker is a joke — height and weight + time alone do NOT give an accurate figure. There is no accounting for distance and resistance — thus, the app’s total was 370 fewer calories than what I actually burned today (356 vs 726). Still useless to me....Tracking workouts used to be painful. Now it's impossible. There's no real functionality behind the minutes of activity chart and it is very painful to edit if you make a mistake. It doesn't sync with the health app so you have to manually update everything. 

Sure it's nice to have the schedules and membership tag on my phone but I can take a picture of the barcode or use the wallet app and the PF website. 

Suggest the developer/product manager have a look at other apps for ideas and gather requirements from actual gym visitors. There is so much potential for a great killer app in this space. This ain't it chief.The app used to work fine but recently it has gone downhill. I am no longer able to access the PF+ workouts (even though I am paying for them)… the app constantly says “Oops, something went wrong! Give it another try or come back later” when attempting to access PF+. The app has also stopped tracking my visits to the gym and any activities I log. At this point it’s basically worthless and very frustrating. I deleted the app and redownloaded it to see if that would fix it -  no such luck.The old version of the app was clunky but provided a great way to log workouts and track weekly, monthly, and yearly. The new update makes logging and tracking these workouts too difficult to follow and does not mesh well with actual workouts in the gym. Using this
New update to track your workouts is now ineffective and does not allow you to compare effectively to previous months and years. Definitely disappointed in the usefulness of the new update and wish the old version was still working.About the only thing of use is the mobile barcode check in feature.   You can’t link with any Apple products including Apple Watch.  You can’t link to Map My Fitness.   The biggest problem is the lack of tracking workouts, xcapture.   That feature used to really motivate me to get to the gym to make sure I met or exceeded last weeks activity, now I can’t compare.   Not sure what anyone was thinking with this app.  It has no value and devalues the club as a whole.As if all of the new reviews don’t speak for themselves, the update is trash. Less tracking? Why? You can’t enter calories burned? The app guesses your burn based on height and weight and it’s WAY off, on a 60 minute workout it under-counted by over 300 calories, and you can’t see the weekly/monthly/yearly summary anymore. Seriously, why on earth wouldn’t you allow people to input the CORRECT amount of calories burned or even distances? Your app developers deserve every single negative review.The workout tracking for the new app is not usable anymore. Seriously anyone who runs wants to track their mileage, not speed. Nobody’s speed is going to be completely constant from warmup to run to cool down. Plus a lot of workouts such as couch to 5k are interval based. Either fix this app or  I’m not using it. The old app was much better for tracking workouts. I care about time exercising and total mileage. If I can’t track that then the app is worthless to me.Judgement free zone but you want me to judge myself a beginner an expert? To what purpose?
How about some simple fitness tracking? Nope, can’t record calories.  Can’t record a workout on the same date as the workout. Has to be yesterday’s date.  This update looks and functions more like a sales pitch to prospective customers instead of paying customers.
The only usable function now is the barcode.
Bring back 7.0!Latest update made things better by adding workout video and some goal monitoring, but..... It advertised tracking workouts, yet isn’t set up to be compatible with any of the equipment. It can’t figure correctly calories burned even if you enter in your height/weight, and now you can’t enter in calories burned. How can the machine and the app be almost 200 calories different!?This app could be so much better but I just feel like it misses the mark big time.

Expectation: Ability to scan a machine and have it log the workout for easy tracking.

Reality: I haven’t any place that in this app that you can scan the QR codes on each machine.

Note: If PF wishes to keep long term customers, I would think they would try to dangle the “workout stat carrot.” This should be the most basic use case of the app.

Expected: ability to create custom workouts and track it on the app.

Reality: no such feature

Note: this would be a great feature to help keep track workouts.I use the app to check in, but that’s about all it’s good for.  You cannot create a custom activity/exercise in the tracking section.  You are forced to pick from a limited set of exercises.  Why bother?  Just carry a notebook or use another more complete workout app.I was a faithful user on this app before they updated it; it was my main source of fitness tracking. Once they changed this app I bought a Fitbit because the app no longer accurately logged calories burnt or distance gone in a workout. I have barely used the app since. Sad.Your app won’t track the amount of people right it said 1 yet there was a packed gym. Thank you for ruining my night making me go all the way down there just to go straight back home since it’s too full. Fix the apps tracking.The update is awful, I used to prefer this app for tracking activity and calories burned, it was motivational to use. Not being able to track calories burned and not manually enter specific things has made me not want to use this app anymore at all...please fix???",5,unhappy_jessacwmst7Ermilokaraelizabeth05CyberpumpkinClemsonu90Anya0301aaaJimmyK MudPhudLoveforLabsBaldyHillHomeMyUnitedStatesOfWhateverJWolf28Will0044Asphalt-manErenningEarnhar768SchultzFlugmonkygrl212MontreeeeeeRufit2Sassy pants smithA Dude Making A Reviewletsreviewshallwe,Xcapture replacement is terribleNew Version took away basic functionalityTerrible update.

But the PF app USED to still track the points. 
If a separate entity is managing points we don’t need to see all of what is going on under the hood to make it all work, there should still be a way to have the points show up in the app. It’s not rocket science, figure it out.
The points tracking was primarily what I used the app for, it was there and  then removed. 2/5, would be a 1/5 but the extra point (pun intended) is for the effort with everything else there that looks great but I don’t use.The app is alright but doesn’t do all kind of stuff I was hoping for, specifically tracking running. I don’t want to download an entirely separate app for just that function. I’ve had other gym/ running apps that did way more than this but this gym is closest to my house so I’ll probably put up with it. Side note, whenever the app updates it completely erases my entire workout history which is obviously quite helpful for tracking things on my own since the app won’t do it.I really liked the snap a workout feature even when it occasionally wouldn’t work properly. I got used to snapping a pic of the machine after my workout. Found it very useful. The new activity tracking feels like a step backward. 
Everything else is fine I guess. It’s nice that they updated and added more example videos etc. but all I really used the app for was to check in and log my workouts. Now more than half the functionality I enjoyed is gone. Hence the 2 starsI am very disappointed with this app. I was looking forward to tracking my successes.
First off the app doesn’t even work inside of my gym, to check in. I try to open it in the parking lot and it literally takes 5 minutes to load. 
I have probably successfully checked in with the app 2 out of 8 times. 

Second it doesn’t sync with their system and according to my app I have zero activity.The only thing I use this app for is checking in to my Planet. It’s absolutely worthless for tracking a workout and I’m really tired of getting the same 6 new messages every day that I can’t delete or get rid of the notifications. 
I feel like o should be able to scan the machine and have it sync my workout to my Apple Watch.  As this app is now, it’s just an electronic keytag.So Disappointed in this new app. Loved the old app for its ease of use of recording your workout with the camera feature and capturing all of the  information. Please bring this feature back!! I valued the tracking as the most important feature of the app. I gave it 2 starts instead of one star as some of the videos look intriguing.",0,Damon.CliffJTGriffin11JohnnyCee83k10 ***Not diggin this app!SEW14,"Doesn’t track pointsIt’s ok, but not great.

I loved the xCaputure feature as it made logging information from treadmills and other PF equipment a snap. If you had to manually input the work out it was no real issue.
 With the current app workout tracking has effectively been eliminated. Not sure if that is the intent or if they are planning on rolling out updates as the new platform rolls out? The lack of clarity of whats to come makes it feel like the users are not apart of the cycle of development. Its basically come back time to time to see what we have done and hope you figure how to make it work.
 I need the app now for one reason, to show my membership. Everything else is just to attract people into the membership, no one is working out to the app, ever. If you could help track fitness progress as previously had with the clunky versions then there would be some value but it has been lost with the updates. So sit up and bring your pencil and log book, we are back to the basics people.When I’d learned about this app being updated to have a more robust exercise tracking experience, I had hope that maybe I could finally wean myself from the Bodyspace app. However, in attempting to find exercises that incorporate the actual strength training machines at PF, there are none. Especially when dealing with the incremental cable plates that don’t let you know the actual weight you’re pushing or pulling. Uninstalled and will stick to Bodyspace until the tracker portion of this app can fully incorporate all exercises on all equipment.I really like the app for tracking my workouts & being able to use the videos for workout plans HOWEVER they should look into having it sync with the equipment you use in the gym. It’s really inconvenient to log into the treadmill, or whatever other equipment, then have to quickly log your workout before the screen times out. At the very least the logins should work over both sides & automatically track on the app. Also would be good to use with the Apple Watch or other fitness watches.Tracking workouts was better on the old version of the app. The new version is not as robust. The new version does not allow you to track distance for running or elliptical training . Also, the app calculates calories and based on weight time and it can’t be changed or adjusted like the old app. The old version of the app allowed you to track all of this and compare year to date workouts on a monthly and weekly basis. New version doesn’t do that.Content gives good ideas on using some of the basic equipment (eg battle ropes, bonsu ball...). It would be great if you could add some of the exercises to a custom workoutplan that would track est. calory burn. Maybe link to Apple's Health app.  Better yet be able to use the barcodes on cardio and other equipment to track estimate and track caloric burn. I've tried using the LifeFitnes ""Connect"" app for this purpose, but PF apparently doesn't register their equipment for trackingDear app developers, please make it easier to log workouts other than cardio. If I cans can a machine I should be able to log weight, reps, sets for that machine. If there is a way it is really hard to find. It would be nice to see a graph that shows progress, goals, and maybe email suggestions for progress. My period tracker has better tracking than this.We love PF!!! The APP could be more intuitive and useful to help with tracking your fitness goals and workouts. Very disappointed that the app does not link with Apple phone or Apple Watch (many other Apps but would have thought Apple would be a no-brainer). That being said 5 stars to PF as the gym and staff are fantastic. Hopefully the PF app follows suit soon!The app works ok. The check in feature is reliable and the activity tracking is good.  Be nice if the My Club portion added club hours for the selected club. I have to use google or some other source to get that info. Mostly its 24/7, but holidays are different and Covid can change things.I mostly use this app for the tutorials
I don't see much point to only tracking my cardio. since you can't track strength workouts it only tracks half my effort
It would also benefit from more tutorials, specifically one on the total body enhancement and more tutorials for stretchingThe app is getting better, BUT you still don’t have a way to track ALL of the PF gym activities.  I like to do the 30 Minute Express Workouts and workouts in the FP 360 and TRX Suspension Training areas.  PLEASE add these to the tracking activity part of the app.Wish app would have a better way of tracking workout sessions for personal workouts on machines as well as cardio.I like work out tracking but manuals do capture input methods lack correct measurements for stair machines or are unavailable ....one facility uses steps another uses floors climbed but app only allows miles....?!?!?

You go use a machine for 30 minutes and at the end it tells you all your stats. You should be able to use the scanner with the app and have all that info loaded immediately.

Workout, quickly scan the machine, automatically updated in the app. That feature alone will drive more business to the gym because people love seeing instant results. 

What it does well? The workouts are nice to have especially for beginners. It gives you a guideline instead of wandering around just randomly trying machines. Checking in is easy. Crowd level is nice. Check on your membership status etc. I mean there is use for the app but it is average at best. Let’s take it next level.I like the capture option for workouts, it keeps the electronic machine tracking simple. The biggest shortcoming is no way to record machines.

I replaced the phone today, reloaded apps etc, and the app is working as it did previously.) 

Updated the app before I went to the gym at 4am to avoid the crowds. Once there, I could not enter activities, and once at the workout screen, could not leave it without closing the app for awhile. I restarted iPhone twice, then deleted and re-uploaded app from App Store. Still not working.

I have generally really appreciated the app for what it does do, although it’s definitely lacking. Cannot track weights progression. Running speeds are only measured as whole numbers—no decimal—so also no tracking progression or intensity. No PF30 tracking or HIIT or other circuit or interval training tracking. And the crowd meter baffles me... It seems like one tick line equals around 5 people??I like a lot of the improved features in this app. Major improvements were made. However, I gave 4 stars because I run on the treadmill a lot and I like to use the app to track my activity through the week. When I log running there is only full mph paces listed to select. I usually run somewhere between 5.0mph and 6.0mph but I have to choose either 5.0mph or 6.0mph. 5.5mph isn’t an option to select for the sake of tracking my pace. I would love the activity tracking to be improved so I can’t more accurately track my individual pace.Change always takes getting use to and the PF app was no different.  At first I did not like the new activity list options and the lack of mileage tracking, but I’ve gotten use to it and accept it.  I would give it a 5 Star rating if it could track the mileage but it doesn’t so it gets 4 Stars.I gave a 4 star instead of a five because I could not find any way to upgrade or change your membership through the app. The FAQ says you can do this but I couldn’t find it anywhere. The workouts and exercises are great and the tracking is very useful.I recently got a membership so I figured the app might help with tracking everything.

They explain every piece of machinery, circuits and options. They took the time to discuss what my needs are in recovery for my knees, to work cohesively with my doctors and helped me find a program that would be beneficial for strengthening, toning etc. 
The staff were welcoming, and willing to help and answer any questions I had. There’s statement holds true too “no judgment zone!” How nice to go to a gym that has such a motto! 
Their app makes working out and tracking so simple and lets you be in control of your fitness & wellness plan.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLANET FITNESS!!! ❤️
Andrea AndersonAll around great app. Love the update! 

I’m an employee at PF and while the new app is great. There are somethings customers miss. Like tracking your snapshot workouts. We need to intergrade that back into the new app. MOST IMPORTANTLY I find that customers spend more time pulling up the app but if we made a widget with just the barcode or if we made a pass for the wallet a lot more people would find that faster and quicker to use.I’m sure there will be improvements in the days ahead, nevertheless it does work, provides essential information for workouts, and beat of all it connect with other activity tracking apps

Overall... very good appThe app easy to use and sinks easily with Fitbit and My Fitness Pal for tracking workouts outside the gym. Speaking of the gym, we’ve been a member at Charter Fitness and LA Fitness and Planet Fitness has them both beat by a mile. Plenty of equipment, super clean facilities, and friendly staff.This app offers so much for everyone: workouts, activity tracking, check-in tracking right at a glance!Love the design and simplicity. Also very useful in terms of tracking your progress.I like going. Works around my schedule. I love that tanning is included. And i like tracking workouts and reward points on the app.It has most of all the great parts of a useful workout app; locations, tracking, videos.

I would love for it to have a pandora plugin for music, calorie and nutrition tracker, and distance pedometer.

This app definitely embraces the best part of a gym but needs some more useful tools to be my one and only fitness app. :)

It has lost a lot of information. The app should allow you to look at past years and use that information to work on your goals. As a runner, you should be able to enter in your mileage information. They did fix that but mph is not accurate so actual mileage is calculated wrong. You should be able to enter in what you did and save it. I wish I never updated this app. I want my old information back and then I will find another app. I never thought an updated app would go backwards with technology and information. Thumbs down!Love PF, and my wife and I are brand new members... HOWEVER- this app should be tooled to help the user track weight loss/fitness goals through apple health or at least give you feed back that can be utilized elsewhere... instead it is just an isolated island. Also, there are SEVERAL machines that don't even scan!!! Have to repeatedly login, and all for almost nothing! Come on, Guys!!!!!I’m disappointed in the new update. I really liked the fact that I could keep up with my workouts and how many calories I burned each week, month and year. It helped me keep track on my fitness goals and was pretty awesome watching my goals progress. Please bring back the old fitness tracker...truly disappointed. That was one of the apps best features.the importance of the quality of basic machines that are needed to fulfill your purpose for which you join a gym, planet fitness does not cover them because it has an excess of cardio machines, in reality the machine is needed for the hip thrust, the leg press hack squat.
planet fitness could be the perfect gym but you need to think about your members' goals and cater to their needs.
Thank youI have a routine. I’d like to keep logging my miles and calories, as reported on the equipment. 

I don’t need ‘new’ routines. That might be great for someone else, but not for the rest of us that are happy and content with what we do and don’t want a new fitness routine. Save that for another app. I just want a tracker so I can keep track of my progress and that I got the goals I had in mind.

At home or in gym and again with the watch please include this to Apple Watch with time frames and plans it would be much better then a video that you can barely see when your at the gym all you have is a 2x5” screen nothing to connect too and a million other ppl around. Also like Dunkin’ Donuts or gas stations apps should be points to encourage more time at the gym for a free shirt towels drinks etc instead of discounts only to a lot of places most people don’t care for. Setting goals and point system would be niceI’m a lifelong athlete, but a newbie to gyms. Planet Fitness has been a fantastic experience and has motivated me to continue my fitness journey, but the app could use a tweak.

My only complaint is that the Activity Tracker does not have the actual gym equipment and gym exercises listed, apart from cardio. For a perfect app and experience, I would appreciate if the developers would consider adding the machine workouts to the list of activities. This would create a more accurate “mins of exercise,” and would more accurately account for burned calories. Personally, I know that I would be much more motivated to work out and hit burned calorie goals if the app registered every available gym machine. 

Overall, the app and gym experience are fantastic, but one change in the app would create a huge difference, and earn a perfect five star review.It would be nice to add a feature to the app so I could potentially find an exercise buddy.

Would I recommend Planet Fitness to those who are intimidated by the big gym, yes I would. The only thing I miss is Body Pump class but I remedied that with my own body pump setup at home.

Kevin M, the trainer is very knowledgeable on what types of exercises would be best for each person he meets. He has a great attitude and has given me so many good tips about the equipment. The Design Your Own Program is another added benefit which allows Kevin to customize the workout to your own goals. I didn’t know what to expect when I signed up. So glad I did now!

The app (using iPhone) not only stores your card so you don’t have to carry it with you, but it makes it very easy to see and schedule all the classes available. An added benefit is that it lets you put the class in your calendar after signing up. It’s also nice to check your schedule later to see what you have signed up to take.Maybe I’m biased cause I’m been going to 24 hour fitness for so long. But I just made the switch today.

Unbelievably, my worst fear confirmed, the app no longer has the “treadmill” option, and they have also “discontinued” the snap a workout feature. That feature was so helpful for me tracking my fitness history. 

But ok, I have to enter manually now, I could reluctantly accept that. Then I learned that to add insult to injury, you can only use the “walking” option as the closest thing to treadmill, and there you can only log your speed and minutes, not your calories or incline. From reading reviews, I learned the super buried feature where if you enter your height and weight, it will calculate the calories, however without the incline info, the calculation is way off. 

Friends, I feel bad saying this but this update is *terrible* — I have never regretted updating an app on this level. The old version was ugly, but it was super useful, and i used it a lot for a very important part of my life. The new version is useless to me. I have been an iphone user since 2008, and I this is the first time i can remember writing any app review. I can only hope you can work quickly to restore needed features to your paying customers.The new app looks nicer and sleeker, but all useful functions have been removed. The option to record/snap a workout was incredibly useful but no longer exists after the update. You also cannot manually enter calorie amounts for your workout, meaning you may burn more calories than they averaged but can’t mark that. Additionally, it is now harder to track your progress because workout history is hidden amongst the convoluted interface. 

PLEASE consider bringing it back because I feel the app just takes up empty space now. Most people who have these apps are much more interested in the practicality of it than the appearance. The new update is just not worth the sacrifices and it’s a huge step backwards.I seriously regret updating.  PF decided to go with pretty over function. The new app is no longer associated with what is in the gym and is now trying to be a more general fitness app.  In the process features like “snap-a-workout” or even just accurately tracking walking on a treadmill has been lost.  What a terrible move by PF to ruin what they had.

The common refrain from the developers is either go online or that has been discontinued.  Both of which scream “we elected to make the App less useful”.  Further the update history clearly shows the deployment of this version was rushed and not fully tested.  The customer response to the changes screams that this version is an outright failure.  Wow how short-sighted of PF.Although I do like some of the new features, the new version is condensed and only takes up 3/4 of my screen, it lost my workout history, and I can’t accurately track my workout stats. For example, I could track the time, distance, and calories of my run and now I can only track the time and MPH... which not only fluctuates because I run intervals, but I can’t even track 5.1 vs 5.5 if I wanted to. I’ve been relying on the app to track my progress and now not only is my past progress gone, but now I can’t accurately track my future successes. While I don’t think the old version was perfect, this new one is definitely only one-star worthy and I deleted the app.I imagine it’s quite common that people enrolled in a health insurance-related reimbursement program rely on a report to make sure they reach their required visits. You can no longer see your check-in history after a recent update. 

After submitting a report through the app requesting this be restored, I received a message that my issue was resolved but it was not. Now I see that developers are directing people to an external site for check-in history which takes functionality away from having everything in one place in a convenient app. 

At the very least, this external link could be added to the app, but if it is, it’s not intuitive to find; I’d expect to see something under the “membership” menu.

It’s possible there are extenuating circumstances that makes it difficult to add a simple visit count each month to the app, but that seems hard to believe. At any rate, the developers’ response thus far has been less than helpful.Are you kidding me? Not only have you made the app so much worse than before but you destroyed people’s workout histories! I have been frequenting your gyms for 4 years now and using the app most of that time, all of my workout history, and such is now gone! No longer can i snap a screen and have it directly! No longer can i record calorie counts! This is total crap! Not everyone who uses your gyms are narcissistic and needing attention through social media but that is all your concerned about! Lastly, you need to stop being deceitful on about this app, look at your recent reviews and you will see the majority of your users are as angry about this app as  I am!Unlike a previous version of the app, the current version no longer lets you record the exact  calories that the various machines display (elliptical, treadmill, etc.). These machines can be set for different levels of difficulty, which result in different calories burned. But for the elliptical, it only lets you enter the duration. For cycling, you have to select an “intensity” in the app, which it translates into some amount of calories, instead of just entering what the machine displayed. This makes the app nearly useless to me for maintaining my history. Numerous reports to their tech support have not resulted in any improvements.Before the 8.0 update this app synced accurately with my Fitbit. It has stopped bringing in data in this new version. On top of that, the data it brought over from the previous version has huge and I mean huge discrepancies. For example, on every day in July and August (and maybe earlier, but I got tired of having to tap on each day to see my stats) it now has a walking entry for 1440 minutes. 1440 minutes is the same as 24 hours. So according to my recent history I have been walking nonstop since July 1. That has to be some kind of world record.By reading the previous reviews, it is obvious that people are not happy with the “new” updated app. 
Yes or no, will the Check-in history feature be reinstalled? If it’s not, then I will be deleting the app. 
I understand that I can access this information by logging into my account from my PC, or going up to the front desk at the gym, and asking for the info. However, I don’t bring my PC or laptop to the gym, nor do I like to go up to the front desk, they are busy enough, as is. 
So, please, save me the waiting time , yes or no, will it be brought back???Update 2: this app is garbage and frankly any company this unfriendly to consumers deserves to fail. Deleting and won’t be renewing my subscription.

Update: they lied when they said they would bring functionality back. You still can’t review your check in history on the app even though you could before. I wish I could give negative stars.

They updated the app and removed the ability to view your check in history.  Removing features is not okay and this will remain one star until they bring it back.The previous version of the app had a (hard to find) way to view your check-in history. The new version seems to be missing that feature completely. I only use the app to check in and check my history, so it's barely useful for me now. Update: The response is to go to their website, so I guess the app is actually useless for me now? I can just use my keytag to check in and save the space on my phone...thanks for the info!Check-in history no longer available through the app.  Please don’t tell me to log into my account separately to check it because the app should make member’s lives easier not make them use multiple avenues to find info related to their ONE membership.  Somebody dropped the ball big time.  Tech Support is also useless—just send back closed ticket notices with nothing actually resolved. Would have given zero stars if I could have.So much lost functionality it’s hard to list everything.  Terrible!  Who in the world thought most of the updates were a good idea.  I wrote a review about check in history missing and received a response I could go to an UNRELATED website to check my history, when of course I could do it right on the app previously. Zero steps forward,  way to many steps backwards.  Great idea - give us LESS with an update than we had before.  AWFUL!The absolute awful support after this last update that ended up wiping out my account and having me start from scratch. 
After the update I was unable to sign into the account with email and password. 
I even tried forgot password. 
This would never send the email to reset the password. 
I waited 24 hours. 
I still cannot get an email resetting my password
Eventually locked my account trying to sign in
Contact support 
Explained the issue. 
Made sure to check the junk mail
Finally forgot password sends an email to reset the password. (or so I thought) 
Nope it was a link to start a new account wiping out all of my former work out history.I liked the app before, found nothing wrong with it. The new ‘improved’ app does not show what I want to see, so it is completely ineffective. Please bring back my check in history, and let us book a trainer more than a week in advance. People in the club can book out over a month so this leaves most people who would like to use this feature out of luck. Terrible experience.On the plus side, the look and feel of the new app is better and cleaner than the previous version.  

From a functionality perspective, it’s a step backwards.  My primary use for the app is to display my barcode to check in. Ever since the update, it takes an excessively long time to retrieve my membership information so the barcode can be displayed. 

I also used the check-in history to keep track of my workouts.  I don’t know if it’s been removed completely, but I can’t find it. At the very least, this is a UI/UX problem. 

Disappointing to see a rollout that offers a worse experience than the previous version.I had two requests; sync with iOS health and activities and show the a history  of payments or pending payment.  

For both I received the same answer, that the app had a bug and it is now fixed.  Of course it does not sync with iOS and of course it does not show the payment history.  

Does anyone read the feedback?  It is very condescending.  Sad.This is the only reason I downloaded the app. I try to keep track of how often go to the gym and this app won’t tell me my check-in history. Apparently I can log into the Planet Fitness website and search for this information. Or go to the front desk of the gym and ask about it. I’m be sure and not do that.WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE THIS FEATURE.
 
NO LONGER SNAP TRACK MY PROGRESS 
IS VERY UPSETTING. That feature alone made the app wonderful to even have it and show it off to others now is a DEAD WEIGHT APP! (((DELETE))). No wonder before the update all captures were failing Where coming back unsuccessful. Where are all my history of runs for the past year . Your app developer needs SMACK IN THE HEAD . What an idiotic way to release a update or is it a PuBLICITy STUNT hmmmm!I like the previous version. This new one is terrible. You cannot see your individual workouts history. You use to be able to just take a pic and it would load up your work out. Not anymore. It is not giving accurate calories per workout because of that. Boo change it back.This app is useless.  I log into the equipment at my home gym and nothing syncs with this app.  I can’t even see the history of my visits.  I’m supposed to be able to track my workouts based on the new Matrix equipment at my gym but it won’t sync with the app.  It is absolute garbage. I wish the developers would take advantage of the technology the equipment offers.The one and only feature of this app I used besides the check in feature was the “check-in history”.... The ability to look back and see all of your check ins at whatever club you went to was a HUGE motivator. Why drop that feature?? Please bring back and you will have my 5-star vote.I literally only used the old app to check my check-in history. Now they have eliminated that feature and only include pictures of workouts designed for old people. I will be deleting the app because they took away what little function it had to begin with. UnbelievableLike nearly everyone on here, removing the snap a workout function and workout history/check in history was so stupid. If you have the bulk of people on here complaining, you should listen and just revert back. This update is literally trash now and developer responses on here are ridiculous, yall should be fired for this update.I log every workout in the app.  My workouts are different each day.  The workout history no longer shows activity by day which makes it harder to go to specific days and review previous workouts.Much like the other reviews, I liked having the check in history easily accessible in the app. They’ve now made it that you can only see this by going to the website, making the app practically useless.What's the point of going to the gym when you put all the workouts in the app? Also, why don't you guys have the history of going to the gym anymore? What about the motivation to actually get people to go to the gym? I also use to be able to add my step tracker...This went totally left field.",4,unhappy_jessaFanAnonimoClemsonu90Gimme Music247Dexo42jnsprengMPC615willswordsId10t-01HskahdusjalajusVeevee_pqsemurcjUnhappy GaryGhost2121Sucky big friggin timebigdad10BichespiPasstheMayoMany21NyC13531aryHenryJHdezNyDieterSheck-WesLowprolopeAZ Traveling ManDTutt2005michicanna,"Xcapture replacement is terriblePrettier, But Utterly Useful after UpdateAwful updateBetter before the update :-/Can no longer view checkin historyWhat a joke!Nearly useless app nowWhat happened?Not functionalRemoved featuresMissing check-in history info?Terrible “upgrade”Worst update EVERAwful support after updateNot a good redoUpdate is a step backwardsLousy feedback responseCan’t view my check-in history through app.SNAP YOUR WORKOUTUpdate is horribleWasted opportunityWhat Happened??New update is awfulHorrible UpdateNew  Version is LESS User FriendlyNewer version removed check in historyHuh?",Planet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness WorkoutsPlanet Fitness Workouts,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,27,0,2516,has_narrative,59

The gym (if you can call it that) is another story. This whole judgment free zone is laughable. People go to a gym to get in shape and develop muscle. If I happen to look better than a majority of the people in there and that is intimidating to you, that’s your problem. Work out harder! Planet fitness is merely a place to hang out and pretend your working out. What I find really funny is the training coaches in the app. In order to look like the Main guy in their introduction video you would need to conduct workouts that would violate their policies. Heaven forbid you start pushing some weight that makes you grunt….. violation. Drop a weight at the end of a set….. violation. I even had a guest that was asked to leave because of his muscular build. They said he would be intimidating to member’s. If your simply liking for a place to socialize and get a tan okay. Are you serious about getting fit and looking good? Go somewhere elseSame review as it’s relevant. I did drop it 2 stars as I keep hoping that some of the old features come back. It’s a simple fix that would make the app 100% functional. 
I love the additional features they added to the app. It would be nice to either add back the feature to snap record a workout or evaluate how the current model records workouts. Example: I run on a treadmill for 3 miles for a total time of 33 minutes. The app should generate an average speed according to those values. It currently has you fill in a generic speed which either over or understates the workout. Also it would be a great add to have sub columns in weightlifting, ie arms, legs, chest, core...& you can have subcategories even on those for a complete workout history. Outside that the app works great, just needs a few touch ups.I suppose I shouldn't be too picky, given the price of the app, but there are several things which irk me about it. 1) I travel A LOT and when I'm overseas and need to manually input a workout, I can't use local time. The app will only accept workout times in the time zone of your home gym! So I have to adjust the time of my workout to The Eastern Time Zone any time I'm in Europe. Seriously? 2) The ""Snap a Workout"" function is nice, but EXTREMELY slow to update. The app says that most workouts will within an hour, but I have yet to see one that shows up in my history in less than 24. 3) How is it possible that there is no option for ""Snow Shoveling"" when manually entering a workout? Things like ""Yardwork"", ""Boxing"", and ""Tai Chi"" are available, so why not something so common as ""Shoveling Snow""?What I find lacking in this app is the ability to customize it and track my individual routines. There is a nice section showing you how to use each machine but you are unlikely to use most of them. And there is a section with their canned routines. But sometimes you are recovering from an injury and need to customize your routine. I’d love to see the following enhancements made to make the app more interactive and practical. 

1) there is a great section showing how to us all the machines but you probably won’t be using most of them and it takes a while to scroll through them. Would love to be able to mark the ones the trainers set me up with on my first day so could quickly find them. Instead the trainer gave me a sheet of paper ripped out of a notebook. Seems silly to carry around a raggedy sheet of paper when the application could do it. 

2) it would then be nice to group those favorites into separate workouts. (I.e.  upper body vs legs)

3) for each machine it should allow you to track weight and seat settings. Ideally you could track a history of weight used to watch your progress.Very disappointed with the latest update. I personally used to love being able to manually enter distance and calories but now it’s automatically calculated by duration and most of the time it’s incorrect. Biggest issue I have is not being able to compare results day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and year-to-year. Now all you get is activity history by day or some other summaries. Still use the app but not as much anymore.

P.S. thanks for adding an option to manually add calories. However, still no way to compare daily, weekly, monthly or annual activities. All activity history shouldn’t be bunches together and should be easily accessible.3 weeks ago, before the latest “bug” fixes the app was working fairly well. Now that the “fixes” are in place, nothing works. Can’t launch the app, can’t log in. The couple of times I was able to get the app to launch nothing within the app would retrieve any information. No membership info, no club info, no workout history, nothing. I’ve tried restarting my iPhone 13, deleting and reinstalling the app, shutting off VPN, access via wi-fi as well as over the air network. All to no avail. It’s a good thing I have a key tag otherwise my gym access might be denied. Time to reboot the upgrade.The update does not allow me to record my work out on the treadmill. The treadmill is not even an option. I am also unable to check my check in history. I am deleting the app from my phone! Very disappointed!!!!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I received a reply from the developer, which was cool but it doesn’t solve the issue that I have with the update. I shouldn’t have to go to another website to check my history when it was offered on the previous version of the app. This feature should not have been removed. How is doing extra steps better?The app is alright but doesn’t do all kind of stuff I was hoping for, specifically tracking running. I don’t want to download an entirely separate app for just that function. I’ve had other gym/ running apps that did way more than this but this gym is closest to my house so I’ll probably put up with it. Side note, whenever the app updates it completely erases my entire workout history which is obviously quite helpful for tracking things on my own since the app won’t do it.There are so many things wrong with this app it’s hard to know where to begin.

It has no Wallet integration, so you have to open the app to get your tag for scanning every time you walk into a Planet Fitness.

You have no access to your visit history, even though PF does keep track of that.

xCapture is truly bizarre, wonky, and involves so many taps to access that it isn’t worth it.

And then most of the other app functions route you to Safari, where you have to log in, again, using a DIFFERENT ACCOUNT.

And, oh yeah, three months after the announcement of the iPhone X, this app still isn’t updated to fit on its screen.

This app gets two stars for saving me the trouble of remembering my member tag. It has no other viable purpose.Can’t access Crowd Meter or quite a few other sections under My Club such as Check-In History and Schedule a Class, app would throw an error. After the latest update it was working for a day or two but not working again.The app is good for showing check in history & crowd meter but I really wanted to track my workouts. The activities listed are VERY LIMITED, i thought it’d at least have the ability to scan equipment and track time on each—but there isn’t.Can’t get on half the stuff. Even the contact us for app troubleshooting gives me an error message!! Can never get on the crowd meter history and rarely can get on the invite a guest.After the last update issue with the QR code’s not working as well as the bar codes now the newest update wipes out your gym visits history.

Since re-downloading the app, no matter how many times I’ve reset my password via email/browser, it always shows “password incorrect.” However I can sign into the website with any issues. Not terrible as I can still go to the gym and provide my number, but still very annoying since the app for me is useless for the moment.Same as many before me today posted, I’m regretting the update.. Update usually means new & improved, but I’m not feeling that with this. I need that log-in history in my phone for easy access (yeah computer log in works, but not everyone carries their laptops around everywhere).  I’m extremely happy with the gym itself, and my membership, but this app is not very user friendly now with this update..The new version doesn’t seem to let you connect to the system to check that your scan in actually logged at check-in.  Since I get a health benefits perk by showing my check-in history, that was always a quick way to make sure.Personally, I like the app, but everytime I try to go look at my check-in history an error comes up. That used to be my favorite feature. A fix would be nice.Please bring back my ability to see how many days I’ve logged in. I need to keep track for my insurance reimbursement and being able to see my history on the app is an easy and convenient way to do so!I like the new look of the app, but I miss having the account information and check-in history tab on the new version of the app. I hope the company reconsiders incorporating them into the new version of the app.",0,"I, M.

After inputting “activity +” details, the summary of activity (duration 55 minutes, burning 380 calories) is shared with the apple developers preinstalled health app., When a user has this function is enabled.  

Unfortunately, this 380 calories is recorded as a fraction by the apple health app; therefore, it is interpreted as less than one calorie burned in 55 minutes. 

It is recorded as .38(point three eight), not even a calorie burned in one hour.

In talking with the health app developer Apple’s tech support for the app. 

It is Planet Fitness responsibility to insure that all functions of their app properly interfaces with Apple in order for Apples health app to properly interpret and record data communicated. 

Accord to Apples “Health App Team”: 
It is the responsibility of Planet Fitness to initiate contact with Apples app developement team to collaborate on resolving this issue.

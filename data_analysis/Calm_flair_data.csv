I have been a subscriber for YEARS and up until now I‚Äôve been ok with the price increases because I use this app more than any other, HOWEVER now that they‚Äôve taken away family share, I will reconsider. I am not CALM about being charged more for less. Apparently leadership at Calm has lost sight of their original core values and succumbed to the ilk of Silicon Valley greed.  I will begin my review of other options and likely not renew. 

Sadly, here was my last review‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been a Calm customer for several years and I love it! My Calm app is with me throughout the day. I start my day with the Daily Meditation (and days that I don‚Äôt, I find I‚Äôm not as positive and prepared to face challenges), I listen to the music options while I work, and often end my day with a Sleep Story. As an entrepreneur, working to get a start up business off the ground, its important for me to find ways to keep myself grounded, and some days, my Calm app is the only thing helping me do that.",0,MeldubCO,Changing my review‚Ä¶,Calm,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,202,has_challenges,10

Historically I‚Äôve listened to the radio but Calm‚Äôs sleep stories are much more effective at quieting my head and getting me back to sleep quickly. None more so than Henry Blofeld‚Äôs explanation of the Laws (not rules!) of Cricket. I have listened to him read those laws at least a dozen times and have yet to make it through the entire ~28 minute session once! His voice, accent and sense of humor are audio-Ambien. PLEASE have Henry read more content!

The guided sessions are superb at bringing mindfulness to the myriad realities and challenges of our lives and helping us address them in our own way. They unveil revelation. I am not embarrassed to say that from some of these revelations or the relief these sessions can bring, I have been ‚Äúmeditated to tears‚Äù on more than one occasion. 

Nothing to date has had the impact Calm has on my perspective on life, myself, my relationships with others and on dealing with life‚Äôs issues.

Not only did it help me cope with the challenges that came with recuperation and help me sleep, it also brought me back to a practice that was once a big part of my life: meditation! And so to say that I am grateful for this app would be an understatement. 

In addition to the daily calm and daily wisdom, I have found that I can only resonate to a few favorite voices in the sleep stories that I find more soothing versus others that can sometimes sound a little too peppy in intonation, though I understand it‚Äôs just a matter of preference and my own temperament, so it‚Äôs all fair game. To each his own! 

All that said, I have a few suggestions:
1) how about a Tibetan chant option for meditation? 
2) some wisdom series recording pace tends to be a little fast‚Äîcan you not alter the recording, please? It‚Äôs nice to listen to the voices in their natural cadence, but slowed down a bit, maybe? 
3) can you add more Cillian Murphy and Jerome Flynn recordings, please? (I love that you added Eva Green!) 
4) the Jay Shetty pieces are too short! I know they‚Äôre meant to be quickies but I really wish they were longer‚Äîat least with the same duration as the daily calm, which I also wish would be more like 15 or even 20 minutes. 

Thank you!!!I love the Calm app!  I recommend getting the premium content.  Calm is a tool for dealing with the challenges of life.  There is more awareness on anxiety, depression, and negative feelings.  I am hopeful for the future because this will improve people‚Äôs lives.  I gifted the app to my friends and family who also enjoy it - beautiful, inspirational meditations, music, masterclasses, teachings, body exercises, sleep stories and music and so much more!  I wish my family and I had Calm for difficult times in our lives.  I am comforted knowing we have Calm now for difficult times in the future.  I am excited to see the upcoming new content which is frequently updated and improved.  Thank you to everyone at Calm - you all inspire and help me!  You changed and improved life for my family, friends, and me!  And for many other people in the world!I‚Äôve found this app to be a real asset in my life. My FD/EMS community has been working on trying to assess some of the more current research regarding stress injury/PTSD that effects our community. As an instructor and Lieutenant, it made focus more on actionable steps we could take and that my crew could take. Most of us are often operating in a zone of heightened stress...and that‚Äôs without the challenges of our personals lives. This past year has really pushed me to take action, to try and balance my stress response, and this app has been very helpful in my pursuit to include mindfulness meditation into my daily routine. I would say that I‚Äôm better for it and definitely recommend it.We use this app for every person in our family! I wake up to daily motivational meditations and put my children to bed using the kids sleep stories. I love falling asleep to the sounds of waterfalls or whales or any other dreamy adventure I‚Äôm hoping to find that is inspired by this app. I‚Äôve also found motivation during the day while at work and it‚Äôs helped me overcome challenges by prompting me to shift my mindset. This versatile program is great for all!Anxiety and stress has ruled my life, but what I‚Äôve learned recently is that your view point of these issues matters. If you see anxiety and stress as being detrimental to your health, your body tenses up. This tense state leads to more anxiety, stress, depression, and can lead to sickness. Meditation is holistic in the sense that it helps you be alright with your current state, allowing your body and mind to ease the tension. This app very much helps the mental muscles we need to be content and understand of today‚Äôs challenges.I‚Äôm an assistant principal, so one can imagine that there are many things coming at me. The Calm App has so many great resources that help me manage all of the challenges that come with the role, especially the Daily Calm. It‚Äôs time for me just to be every morning before I leave for work. And I‚Äôve learned quotations and bits of wisdom that have helped me frame my thinking. I received some feedback on a particularly hectic day, ‚ÄúHow are you so chill?‚Äù I responded that the Calm App plays a big role. Thanks, Calm App Team!This is a helpful tool for the day-to-day challenges of life. It brings awareness to the importance of applying mindfulness to all we do, however mundane it may appear to be at that moment. It raises consciousness and makes living be intentional. Every aspect of our life on Earth becomes equally precious by eliminating the boring and the unimportant. 
I find myself no longer trying to avoid what I used to view as uncomfortable or even wasteful. Everything and everyone has a purpose and it‚Äôs up to the individual to acknowledge that.I have been using the Calm app for more than five years. Teaching, masterclasses, music, bedtime sleep stories, and focused meditations have helped me through the years and has become a part of my morning daily ritual. The Daily Trip with Jeff Warren has been a balm in many ways to help me grow through lifes challenges. The app is well organized and it is easy to access all the different choices.

And I suppose they‚Äôve shown that to an extent‚Äî they continually remove useful features either permanently or place them behind a pay wall.

My students are often so stressed out and sleep deprived I feel so helpless to help them.  This year I decided to dedicate one day a week to meditating before we started class.  We do this every Thursday for the first 10-15 minutes of class. The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it‚Äôs the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.  I have heard so many times this year, ‚ÄúI needed that!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI needed to hear that today.‚Äù  After on session one of my boys said, ‚ÄúMan I was so upset about losing those 5 points on my English test and now I have let it go.  This really works.  What did you all think about?‚Äù  You know you are doing something right when teenagers open up and start talking.  Thank you for this product and allowing me the opportunity to give my students at least 15 minutes a week to destress, calm down, learn to love themselves and just breath! Can‚Äôt wait to see what the future has in store for me and my students as we take this CALM journey.I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this app. I‚Äôm a life long somewhat insomniac that cannot fall asleep unless I have something that ‚Äúoccupies‚Äù my brain, so I can turn off all the junk I worry about. These stories are highly entertaining, and very interesting, yet calming at the same time. They‚Äôre also educational! I‚Äôve learned many things from around the world that I didn‚Äôt know before. Most nights I‚Äôm out after 2-5 minutes, but some take longer. If I wake up during the night, I simply start a new story and I‚Äôm asleep again. I have my favorite narrators too. I find that male voices with accents other than American (with the exception of Erik Brah and Alan Sklar) really lull me to sleep. I need a deep voice lol. Females with British, Asian, Indian accents are great for me too. There‚Äôs also calming nature sounds and spa music. I‚Äôve been using the Calm app for 2 years now and it never disappoints! Now I don‚Äôt have to reach for the Xanax anymore!I love this app and am a lifetime access subscription holder.

I love statistics. I love capturing them, analyzing them, and (hopefully) using them to some good end. This is one of the amazing aspects of the iOS sphere of products!

However, because Calm disappoints and puts me in a awkward situation due to the fact it erroneously logs Sleep Stories as Mindfulness Minutes in HealthKit.

I do not want to throw off my daily Mindfulness Minutes by logging long Sleep Stories, so I must disabled HealthKit integration in Calm. This is the lesser of evils though as by not having HealthKit enabled in Calm, I do not capture actual Mindfulness Minutes metrics from actual Calm meditation sessions.

Having the ability to log mediation minutes to HealthKit but NOT Sleep Stories minutes would encourage me to become a better practitioner of meditation using Calm. I‚Äôd be capturing accurate data to help gauge my progress (or lack thereof) of my burgeoning meditation routine.

I put in a feature request for this ages ago and it never came to be, so I‚Äôm re-voicing the request here. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one with this quandary.I've only been using Calm for about 6 weeks and am already completely amazed by how Tamara and her team's daily suggestions, encouragements and points of focus have so positively impacted my thought process and overall emotional and physical well being.

Four of the fundamental key lessons I've learned (mindfulness, non-judgmental thinking of self/others/thoughts/etc, carrying less ""weight"" in life, always returning to the breath), among the countless others, are already changing my life for the better day by day by day - just incredible.

There's always more to learn about mindful meditation and yourself every day...I started using Calm 3 years ago during one of the lowest points in my life. What a difference it has made for me!
The sleep stories are amazingly beautiful and effective, the guided meditations perfect for beginners or seasoned meditators and the inspirational bits just what I need when I‚Äôm feeling down. 
My favorite is the Daily Trip with Jeff. Love all his series, especially the beginner ones. He literally teaches the fundamentals of meditation in such an easy and unpretentious way. 
I am very grateful to all the creators and contributors behind this app.I first was able to try Calm through an employer subscription offered to me as an employee. It was something that took me some time to make a habit and explore, but I am so glad I did.

I have certain sleep stories that I really enjoy however, I sometimes don't fall asleep before the story is over.  Having to engage with my phone when the story ends and encounter the ""Still Awake?

Here are some thoughts for better functionality for some of us.

Add a button to eliminate sleep stories we don‚Äôt want so as not to have to scroll through rows and rows of stories I don‚Äôt understand or like.  Often I fall asleep before a story is over and before I can add a heart, forgetting the next day to do it then.

Add a function to allow for continuous play of the masterclass sessions or meditation session.  Also add a shuffle feature for the stories.  It‚Äôs a hassle to constantly fumble with the device every few minutes to proceed through sessions.  Personally, I like to use the classes and meditations as sleep stories too.

Their Master classes are great for learning things like mindful eating, better sleep, how to relax, and even improving your performance in life. All star narrators like Lebron James, Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu, Bindi Irwin, Bob Ross, Jerome Flynn, Leona Lewis, Jason Kidd & more read sleep stories & give advice on how to improve aspects of your life. Sabrina Carpenter & Sam Smith give music mixes to help you sleep or relax. They even have a calm body to help you wake up, warm up/cool down from your workout, reset for the afternoon and wind down for the evening. This app is for your whole body not just your mind. Keep up the amazing work Calm. This app is worth every penny.What I love: I use this app almost every night for the sleep stories, which are excellent and highly effective. Thank you SO much for providing such high quality scripts and voice talent. I also appreciate the variety of topics - and diversity of voices. My issue: Most of the stories are around 30 minutes, which is long enough to put me to sleep. But then I often awaken when they end and have to manually restart or start a different one, which means more interrupted sleep. My request: Please please please add either a playlist option or continuous play feature and/or more anthologies. Thank you üôèüíóIt‚Äôs incredible the impact that being in control of your own mind can have in your life. This app has helped in so many ways, not just in practicing mediation as a daily habit, but also in attaining peace and quiet. The daily practice allows me to be more disciplined. Meditation is a habit that can have a spark reaction, bringing into your life more healthy and positive habits, derived from a disciplined mind. I love the sleep stories, and the catalog of music and soundscapes. The content is continuously being updated, and I find the app‚Äôs UI very beautiful and friendly (as an iOS developer). Overall, I highly recommend this app which will provide you with real and meaningful value.I‚Äôm a high school student, a little bit depressed and always anxious‚Äîaround people, at work. I downloaded Calm about a year ago, and it has really helped me compartmentalize my stressful thoughts, and forget about them when I need to. Before bed, or before or during homework is a great time for it.

I don‚Äôt really feel safe at school in the sense that there is not a place to hide or be by myself when I am feeling overwhelmed, but the nature audio (which is free) helps me zone out during class, or lunch, or passing period when I‚Äôve got my headphones.

I also have a younger sibling who doesn‚Äôt fall asleep when she‚Äôs supposed to. Calm has these stories for children (and adults, I believe) and sleep talkdowns also in the app, which I put on for her. It always works.

I introduced the app to my friends and my mom and so far everyone has had a use for it. A lot of my apps I lose a purpose for and end up deleting them for space‚ÄîCalm is not one of those. It‚Äôs got a wide variety of uses, great technical support who listen to feedback, and best of all it‚Äôs given me peace of mind.When 2018 began, I had few resolutions like everybody, meditation was one off them and I tried many apps and used 3 meditations apps daily one in morning, one afternoon & last one at evening. After a month's trial,I got rid of other and sticked to Calm. Not because others were bad but Calm's presentation was more alluring. It's style is more sophisticated than others. Music, stories, UI, everything is well made.

I have currently 300+ continuous streak. This app has winded down my days 'Calmly'. This app is must have for all & best example for how softwares can improve life. And thank you developers for such a masterpiece & I love Tamara Levitt's narration.I truly enjoy this app and it has helped me be more mindful in my day to day. I tend to be an over thinker and have codependent tendencies and am using this app to help calm my mind. I have only been using it for about a month and I can already tell that my reactions to things have switched into responses with a much more clear head space. 

My one piece if feedback would be that the developers add a feature that when using the app your phone automatically goes into ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù mode so that texts and phone calls do not distrust your mediation practice.I'm glad I start my days with Calm. It has begun to really impact my life in a positive way. I was excited to see Spanish content being added and just wanted to share some feedback from someone who is bilingual. It would be great if rather than selecting one language In your settings for the whole experience, that you would be able to choose to view the Spanish content in your library with the English content and filtered by language while using the English version of the app.I‚Äôm an assistant principal, so one can imagine that there are many things coming at me. The Calm App has so many great resources that help me manage all of the challenges that come with the role, especially the Daily Calm. It‚Äôs time for me just to be every morning before I leave for work. And I‚Äôve learned quotations and bits of wisdom that have helped me frame my thinking. I received some feedback on a particularly hectic day, ‚ÄúHow are you so chill?‚Äù I responded that the Calm App plays a big role. Thanks, Calm App Team!Use Calm daily. Sleep stories help me sleep and soundscapes are great for concentration for work or relaxation.  

Create Sleep Stories Playlist please, please, please! This way you can listen to multiple stories in a row without having to manually select it. Restarting the story every time I wake up so the story doesn‚Äôt end really is disrupting. 

For very light sleepers that wake up at any change in sound, continuous play of sleep stories would be helpful.I‚Äôve battled anxiety & depression for over 30 yrs. I‚Äôve been to doctors, therapists, read books, listened to self help cd‚Äôs, tried several medications and done procedures such as biofeedback. Nothing has calmed me as quickly as this app!!! I heard about it watching Netflix ‚Äúexplained‚Äù series, the episode on mindfulness. I‚Äôve only done 2 sessions and I‚Äôm just amazed how quickly it works! Wonderful!!! My only complaint is it‚Äôs taken me so long to discover!I first was able to try Calm through an employer subscription offered to me as an employee. It was something that took me some time to make a habit and explore, but I am so glad I did. I have since left the company that offered it and am happy to be a paid subscriber for this level of content that is regularly added and updated.

Caching and syncing aside the app fails to create a consistent experience regardless of time zone and that is a flaw. Customer service looses credibility when they try to explain it away as if that is just the way it is or has to be. They attempt to talk circles around the average consumer because they don't know the wiser. That non-explination falls flat to me because I am a digital communications major who is well versed in tech.

Instead of trying to explain away this unfortunate product shortcoming they should try and practice service recovery and invest in the app to bring it up to speed w/their competitors.

I am extremely disappointed. I will be deleting the app and moving on. If they knew anything about customer service recovery they would do something or offer a make-good instead of crafting big-word excuses.

Customer service turnaround time is horrible as well. I sent over my original concern on a Saturday and it took them 4 whole business days to respond. So lame. This is how companies get washed out in this digital landscape. Here today, gone tomorrow. I have a decent amount of influence in my social circles and have encouraged friends and family to download and use Calm. I will now, based on this conversation, fire up the App Store and move on to a competitor...and so will they.

Do better. Don't make excuses. Take action.I actually like the app very much, but find that I do not use it.  I got an email notice for an automatic renewal, but I decided to cancel.  About a week ago, I opened the email and went to the renew area.  At the bottom was a  cancel option.  I clicked it and it said I couldn‚Äôt connect.  So, I reopened it and all the options to buy were present, except the cancel option.  Weird.  So, to test the connection I tapped the monthly renewal option and, sure enough, it opened right away and was willing to take my money.  I did not click to pay, but closed out.  Then I send a note to apple about my problem - with no response still.  I then went to my app account and, again, there is no option to cancel this app, only to renew.  That is why I gave a one star on the review.  I guess my next step is to remove my credit card from the App Store, so I don‚Äôt get an automatic renew charge.  How stupid is that?!This app has every potential to help people and their mental health. It‚Äôs obvious however that it has just been designed by another entrepreneur with the intention of getting rich. I find it shocking that the FIRST thing it tries to get you to do once you‚Äôve finished a meditation is to share a quote to social media. This is encouraging the exact kind of behaviour that meditation is trying to relieve you from. It also does so under the heading ‚Äúthink about how it feels to check in with yourself‚Äù. I find it incredibly exploitative that after meditation, you are directed to ‚Äúcheck in with yourself‚Äù by sharing a quote to social media. Clearly the app‚Äôs primary intention is to grow wealth for the owner. This should be the very last option someone sees, with mood diary, helpful links, etc coming first.I deal with ADD, depression and Social anxiety. I was recommended meditation and I decided I‚Äôd try it. I first downloaded this app in 2017. And used it and loved it for a while until the app updated and now to do any sort of guided meditation longer than two days you have to pay the hefty price of 70 bucks a year. It irks me when apps like this are advertised to ‚ÄúImprove your mental health.‚Äù When in reality they are monetary traps meant to exploit and take advantage of those who are at a vulnerable point in their lives. More proof that mental illness is being commercialized and used as a means to reap profit. They should be ashamed. Offering up an app that‚Äôs supposed to help people who are desperate for help then turning around and paywalling them.

The app glitched out. A LOT. I know it wasn‚Äôt my phone or Internet connection. But I could barely get through any of the stories or meditations without the app freezing and closing at least once. I loved the meditations and stories, but it was really annoying when this happened every ten minutes or so. 

Next: the lack of free content. I understand that they need to make money like any other business. However, I am not willing to pay for a subscription. This seemed to affect a lot of different things on the app, as I could barely do anything. As I said, I understand that they have to make money, but they also have to realize that there are users out there who can‚Äôt pay. There‚Äôs not a lot you can do without this, which really saddened me. 

The idea is wonderful. It‚Äôs easy to use and the services are nice. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a five star app, but it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôd encourage you to still try it out. Judge for yourself!The marginal cost of providing a digital app to a new user is low, especially given how large the user base is. While I appreciate that this app was created, I was appalled by the price point - $70/year! This creates so many equity issues and forces me to question the intentions of its creators. At first, I was excited to pay a bit of money to support creators that were addressing a true social issue. After I saw the price point, I realized that this was actually a way to profit off of people‚Äôs mental instability.

I work full time. I travel. I have struggled with worry, rumination, perfectionism, some anxiety, and poor sleep, for years. Even more-so after becoming a mom, which comes with a whole new set of worries for another person! I have tried through the years to get myself into a routine that includes meditation & relaxation, but always fall off track. THIS app allows me to plug in any time I want, and seek a brief meditation on a topic that I am most in need of at that moment. Whether I‚Äôm stressing over a big presentation, or having trouble with connection, the list of guided meditations is plentiful. Or I can just go solo one day (unguided) to the tranquil sounds of the scene of my choice. I also now love doing this...I open the app, choose a scene, usually a nature scene (with audio), set preference for scene to function while app is closed,  connect it to my Bluetooth speaker, and let it play while the phone is displayed right in front of me on my desk working from home. Def try the premium trial. It‚Äôs worth it to go premium.I struggle with anxiety and insomnia. I've meditated on and off for years and felt better but recently had lost interest in my usual mantra meditations. I'd been thinking mindfulness would be good to try but couldn't quite get myself to spend hundreds of dollars for official classes. A friend told me about Calm and I decided to try it. I was surprised by the high quality of the instruction. It's like having a guru, therapist, and wise friend all in one. After a week I decided to pay for the full version. Incredible value for money. I've meditated every day for two months and been able to bring mindfulness to many areas of my life - my job, eating habits, and social interactions. Those are all still a work in progress but becoming more aware of how my anxiety affects me in those settings is a huge first step. I also love the sleep stories and music. I love knowing that if I wake up in the middle of the night I have this great tool to help me break the gerbil wheel of worrying thoughts and fall back to sleep.I've never been able to actually relax enough to meditate. Today, I didn't quit before giving it a true try. I experienced a sense of connection to life. A sweet calmness relaxed my heart rate and my muscles as well as my thinking.
I'm a believer in Jesus as the one savior. The entire bible is knit together too perfectly for it to have been a hoax. 
For the reason of being a Christian, I thought that true meditation would conflict. I believed that if one opened their mind to relaxation then it would allow for evil thoughts to sneak in.
This is NOT what I experienced. 
I simply continued to know my lord, and savior as I worked to relieve my self of the stress in my life. Therefore, allowing for meditation and Christianity to work as a powerful force to release the power of stress in my life. A way to look at my life one moment at a time. No overwhelming thoughts were given the power to ruin my moment, hours or day... I feel at peace and confident that God is ultimately in control!I struggle with anxiety and depression, plus the related insomnia. My doctors have all recommended meditation but I couldn‚Äôt ever figure out how to do it. The guidance on this app, however, finally made the connection for me. I‚Äôve learned how to quiet my mind without additional medication. Not saying all my problems are gone - just that I have a new tool to help me cope. 

And the sleep stories are the best! Anytime the brain won‚Äôt let me sleep, I turn a sleep story on. It engages my mind enough to distract it from the litany of worries, stresses, and reminders of middle school embarrassments. I love the wide variety of narrators and subject matter.

One other thing... when I began looking for a meditation app, I really wanted to avoid any that promoted specific spiritual or religious practices. I haven‚Äôt come across anything like that in Calm. I can fold these meditations into my own beliefs/traditions without feeling stressed that they‚Äôre in conflict with one another.As soon as I experienced the mind - body connection 
These short guided meditations create , I became addicted!
Now I have to have my meditation time upon awakening in the AM with Tamara‚Äôs ‚ÄúDaily Calm‚Äù and in the evening with ‚ÄúDeep Sleep Release‚Äù.  In between or when I just want more of what is offered , I go for it and am rarely disappointed.  Tamara is so present it is like having your own personal ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù Trainer right beside you with full attention on your betterment. I have practiced qigong for years and this is a wonderful quick pick me up selection of meditations when I‚Äôm too lazy to do a more physical meditation.  PLUS,  Tamara really helps you understand why you focus on the breath more than I have learned from others. I also love her tasteful selection of quotes and allegories to take into my day. 

  I‚Äôm a creative person and I think Tamara particularly understands the energy of creative people and resonates with that energy more than other guided meditation facilitators I have tried. 
  Thank you so much Tamara for having created a meaningful, healing  app to help us all be more mindful and connected to ourselves in a world that is filled with distractions constantly pulling us away from our ability to be centered and connected and mindful throughout the day.Hi I am really enjoying the calm app. At first I did not like the sound of Tamra Levitt voice because it wasn‚Äôt relaxing to me. She narrates the majority of the meditations. But I am getting used to her voice and also there are a lot of meditations where you have the option of a male narrator with a more calming voice. I do wish they had a female narrator with a lower tone voice. It‚Äôs important to have a variety of voices and not use one voice for the majority of the meditations because that voice could not soothe some people. I have trouble with high pitched voices while meditating. But so far I am really enjoying the app because it is helping me limit my social media activity and I just feel better being on this app then on Instagram or TickTock etc.I have had so many problems with life just being life sometimes. It was going entirely too fast and far too often I began to forget to live in the RIGHT now and be present. It‚Äôs actually scary to think about because I was in my body at all times but I got so lost in my thoughts that I begin to wonder ‚Äúwho controlled me when I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthere‚Äù fully?‚Äù This is my first day using Calm and I‚Äôm thoroughly impressed off of the trial that I got when initially downloading the app. It is very late at night and you guys magically appeared in ad form on a social network that I was browsing at the time. I will be putting money into this app and recommending to everyone that I speak to. Again I say, thank you.Beyond the artistry of Calm‚Äôs daily meditations is its thoughtful content.  From body movement to nightly calming stories there is something for whatever you need in any particular day. 

I recently attempted the kids meditation with my 11 year old son. He has ADHD and it was a hard sell. Within 3 minutes and Tamara‚Äôs calming voice he was calmed and invested. Tamara mentioned having anxiety over something you might have said and being unsure. My son said, mom! That exactly how I feel!  We finished the meditation and he was calm and ready to talk about his social anxiety. What a great momma and son bonding time! 

Love this thoughtful app. I am so blessed to have it as a tool in my life‚Äôs toolkit.I struggle at night to just lay there and go to sleep. I don‚Äôt want to think. So I distract myself with a game or social media only to get sucked in and end up staying up WAY later than I had wanted. Calm has really helped me with this. Instead, I‚Äôll click on the app and try one of the many options to help me sleep. Sometimes a sleep story does the trick, other times it doesn‚Äôt so I try something else. One night the sound of rain is soothing to me, and the next night it bugs me so I try a meditation instead. I love the variety available because of my ever changing moods. But it has been very helpful and I recommend it to everyone.I have to admit, I was very skeptical in the abilities of this app to assist me in falling asleep. I woke up around 1:00 am and as usual could not go back to sleep. I ended up turning to social media to pass the time until I fell asleep and came across an ad for this app. I figured ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. I downloaded the app, answered a few simple questions and started this story ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù read by Matthew McConaughey. I listened for a while with my skeptical thoughts still passing though my mind until I actually fell asleep! I woke up again around 3:00 am and immediately turned to Calm and was asleep within a few minutes! I am so impressed! This is something I look forward to utilizing every day! Thank you!I can‚Äôt say enough about Calm, in fact everyone who knows me knows that I swear by Calm more than once daily to enable me to focus, control emotions, and have also seen my personal relationships and career develop beyond what I thought was possible. Tamara is my favorite next to Cillian Murphy, but I have to say there isn‚Äôt any session I haven‚Äôt fully enjoyed. If there was a lifetime membership I would do it. This journey has changed the way I view everything in my life. Especially during the pandemic and political and social issues this year has brought. I‚Äôm so much more grounded. Thank you Calm and everyone who invests in this!!!Hands down the best sleeping aid I‚Äôve ever used! I do not Fall a sleep without listening to a sleep story or a meditation. This app helps quickly bring you to sleep even after the hectic chaos of my day. I use to sit in bed ready and scrolling social media for an hour, wasting so much valuable sleep time. Now I just turn on a sleep story and am asleep before it needs! Worth the $60 annual purchased, for the cost of a pair of shoes a year, I‚Äôm able to sleep 8 hours a night without waking. Also, their customer service is great. I had a billing issue and they went above and beyond to assist.I have always had trouble falling asleep. I am not the type of person who can just lay in bed and fall asleep within 5 minutes. I am the type that will lay in bed, read my emails, check my finance apps, check social media, browse netflix, browse something else and then do it all over again until I get sleepy and finally fall asleep after 2 hours of laying in bed. BUT...since I subscribed to calm, I put on my headphones and listen to a session of sleep (which are usually 8-20 mins) and I am asleep before the session even ends! I love it!!I signed up for Calm about 4 months ago with a free trial positive that I would cancel at the end.  2 nights into using it I knew this app was worth every cent!

Calm has helped me (as someone working in the social work field) fall asleep when my mind is racing.  When my kids are having a hard time calming down we use it to stop and breathe.  I have used this app nearly every day since I downloaded it and have been so impressed by the new content being added (helloooooo Matthew McConaughey)! 

The kids beg for a sleep story every night and I cherish the cuddles while we listen ‚ô•Ô∏èIn August of 2019, I applied to get Calm for free. The people at calm said that if you worked in education and wanted to try it - let them do it for free! I am a social worker in a low Socioeconomic school district and people in my circle laughed ‚Äú you are going to get these kids to meditate?‚Äù  Let me scream it from the rooftops- THIS APP HAS CHANGED THESE KIDS MINDSET.

The focus is definitely on a lot of talking and guidance. The paid plan gives you access to a large number of sessions. But most of these are by one individual. The lack of variety is surprising, especially give the cost. Starting in Jan 2021, the offerings improved, but mostly more of the same. 

To make matters worse, the app supposedly tracks your sessions. Results are inconsistent, with some sessions not logged. There was briefly a display of a weekly goal, in addition to ‚Äústreaks.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm on a new phone and that is gone? Why? A few months ago, sessions weren‚Äôt being logged if the app wasn‚Äôt open when the session ended. <sigh> Again, surprising shortcomings for the price and how long Calm had been around.

I got subscription through Amex, which is nice, but I won‚Äôt be renewing. That‚Äôs for sure.This app is great if you‚Äôre new to mediation, but it used to be better. For some reason, not all of the mediation series will keep track of where you‚Äôre at in the series, only the ones authored by Tamera (not saying anything against her but this is such a pointless drop in app design). 

The streak calendar will only keep track of completed meditations, but at the same time, you can‚Äôt click on a day to see which meditations you completed. On top of that, if calm doesn‚Äôt record a meditation you complete and you enter it manually it will break your ‚Äústreak.‚Äù 

ALL of the meditations have the same flow format (ie, starts with a message, meditate for two minutes, ends with message), which gets corny and old. It‚Äôs time to put some actual GUIDED meditations back on the app where the narrators are just there to guide NOT to LEAD or talk at youI have been a long time user of calm, but my streak ended at 665 days due to LOUSY, POOR support. When my subscription came up for renewal I was trying to pay on their website. My credit card kept getting refused. It should not have been. I tried for three days. DID SUPPORT REPLY TO MY INQUIRY? No. It finally got accepted but then my subscription was locked! 

I do not mind if they do not have phone support. But I do like easy access to email support. The app does not have that. The alludes to having it. But it is not there. 

I have lost my streak and my faith in this app. I am going to request a refund. Given the lack of support, I will probably have to cancel my credit card payment and deal with the bank.So I downloaded calm a year ago and absolutely fell in love. I would use a story time every night and loved the streak to hold myself accountable. I stopped using the app for a month or two. I am completely devastated. While originally there were only 5 or 6 sleep stories, now there are two (one that is targeted for younger children). The meditations have been cut down by an extreme amount. I feel guilty because I‚Äôve been recommending this app to people like crazy and they came back asking why I would recommend something with such a high membership fee.

Now I‚Äôve got to sit up in bed, grab my reading glasses, X out of the intrusive pop-ups, and scroll through to re-find the sleep story that was snatched away from me....leaving me not at all calm, but instead, annoyed and anxious, and now unable to fall back to sleep.

After I did the latest update a couple days ago, none of the meditations will play and none of the meditations will download.

The only meditation that will play is the Daily Calm from the homepage. I‚Äôm on an iPhone X, all updated. I hope this helps the developers fix it and get it pushed to its playing customers in the next day or else I will have to download a different app. I don‚Äôt want to!I look forward to a daily session with Jeff, Tamara, Jay, or Mel.

But Calm has added a ""feature"" that bugs me to no end: there's now a giant widget on the app's main screen to shove in your face some numbers and checkmarks to communicate your adherence/streak (# of times you had a session on the week). And more of the same nonsense when you finish a session. Uh... thanks??

It feels like you're assigning me homework. This clumsy attempt at gamification only serves to raise my anxiety, not lower it. There's a ""Show Streaks"" option in the app Settings, but turning it off has no effect on this dopey intrusion. It just seems so ill-advised and out-of-sorts with the whole tranquility vibe. I come to Calm because I could use some help chilling-the-eff-out, not to be spurred on to ""Close your rings! C'mon lazy guy! DO IT!"".

I was introduced to mindfulness and meditation through this app and it was very insightful in the beginning. I‚Äôm a yearly subscriber and am currently on a 370+ day streak (great gamification feature btw)

Frankly, the more I use it the more dull it gets. I haven‚Äôt seen much change since I first used it a few years ago. Even looking through the update history it‚Äôs a copy-paste about the app rather than what the update entails. It does feel like not much has changed. 

I‚Äôd be great to see some bugs fixed, meditation searches more intuitive, a better save library - maybe letting users have their own playlists for different types of meditations, and, in my opinion, adding more variety of meditations and series rather than getting big names as narrators. 

As a genuinely big fan of the app I‚Äôd just love to see some changes to make this app the hub for meditation. Keeping it exciting, challenging, and effective even for people who do it dailyFirstly, this is a great app. It was recommended to me by a health and wellness coach as a tool for strengthening my resiliency. It has definitely helped. After having used this app for over a year now, and through such life changes as losing a parent to cancer, moving houses twice and weathering temporary separation from my partner due to his work projects, well let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm glad  to have this app in my toolkit.

Amongst other things, I‚Äôve been using the Kids Sleep Stories to help my kiddo sleep at night. The drawback to doing that is that Calm will track this as part of my usage, so it‚Äôs making my Stats and Streaks inaccurate.

I wish there was a way to track my kiddo‚Äôs usage separately without paying for another account. Perhaps a Kids Only Dashboard?

Other than that, I‚Äôm in love with the quality of content and all the different ways this app supports my mental health. I turned on push notifications for ‚ÄòResets‚Äô and love the messages I get from that. The Breathing exercises are well designed, not too busy and with sufficient visual and audio cues. I‚Äôm enjoying the different Masterclasses and Daily content as well.Love this app. I use it daily/nightly. Never thought I would fall asleep to talking as I can‚Äôt focus but I did! 
Only things I wish I could change is that a soundscape counted toward your ‚Äústreak‚Äù, and that you can create your own playlist! I love certain narrators and wish I could mix and match a few. I hate waking up and not hearing something so I‚Äôd love to have a few hours worth stacked up of my choice.

I had a near death experience (NDE) a little over a year ago. The emotional path that can follow was a little tough, as was seeing and feeling the imperfectness of being a human more intensely. Thanks to a few friends who had raved about meditation apps at a family reunion (not mine), I search and found this ap a few weeks after the NDE.  I love the effective, short Daily Calm meditation (~10-12 minutes), so easy to fit in, so effective in creating a calming break for the mind which can bring at least a moment‚Äôs peace, and can also help bring a much longer peaceful perspective reset. There‚Äôs even a three minute emergency meditation, nighttime sleep meditations, specific areas of interest series as well as wonderful option of Master Classes. Check it out. My longest streak (it tracks this for you) was 27 day, just after the NDE, but some were just a day or two before I miss a day or two. 
Focusing on the breath ... your breath ... following it. So effective. And the reflections at the end, with the beautiful daily picture ... are daily gems. Thanks to Tamara Levitt, thanks to Daily Calm.Thanks for this fantastic app. I got this to aid in sleep while on international travel. That was ok but then I browsed the rest of the app and got interested in the meditation. Health providers have encouraged me for years to do this but I always assumed my mind was not disciplined enough for the practice. Enter Jeff Warren‚Äôs 30 Day course. I was hooked from my first ‚Äúsit‚Äù. Bringing your mind back to your focus without judgment and with compassion towards yourself is such a simple but powerful concept. I completed that course and have done others on managing pain and self esteem, as well as daily guides. I have even just used the timed meditation feature and ventured out on my own. I am a metrics kind of gal and I can report a data backed improvement in my resting heart rate. I wear a ring tracker and my sleep and RHR scores are improved.  Sorry to run on and on....this is a fantastic app for me and I hope you try it. Anyone can meditate.In 2017 I started feeling guided to meditate for the first time. I sat down on the floor & started a 20 minute session. Let‚Äôs just say I didn‚Äôt even make it to 4 minutes. It felt like forever. I felt lost when it came to meditation. But eventually I came across the Calm app. 

I did the free meditations & loved them. But I also wanted to do just my own meditations. Just focusing on my breathing. So I started with one minute, then the next day two minutes, then the next three, then four, then five. & kept building up each day until I got to fifteen minutes & that‚Äôs how long I meditate now. 

The Calm app‚Äôs timer is so soothing. It‚Äôs not loud. It doesn‚Äôt make me jump when I hear it (I have anxiety). It‚Äôs perfect. 

In February of 2019 I decided that I was going to do a 30 day meditation challenge (15 mins per day). & being able to see my ‚Äústreak‚Äù encouraged me so much. I did it! Which was so huge for me. 

But now I‚Äôm here in August & I‚Äôm currently on a 30 challenge but I want to go further. I want to go all the way until Jan. 1st, 2020 & then start building up to 30 minutes a day. 

I do not use be Calm subscriptions as I just do not have the money for it right now. But the free things that Calm offers? Incredible. 

Thank you, Calm, for your app! Also thank you for responding when I tag you in my insta stories! 

5 stars. Amazing. Thank you!Calm was my first introduction to meditation, and I‚Äôm still using it one year later. Thank you! Really good guidance for beginners and those growing their practices. A wide variety of themes makes it easy to customize my practice. 

The app is continually improving with new content, more organization, and bug fixes. 

ONE big request: on the Streak stat page, consider highlighting he current streak instead of the overall longest streak. Or hide the longest streak in a menu option that people can look up if they want. The purpose is to stay present feel accomplishment in any current streak, even if it‚Äôs small‚Äîand not be tempted to compare it to my longest past streak and feel bad. It‚Äôs still nice to know the longest, but would prefer on a voluntary basisI love this app for so many reasons. I love the appearance of the app, I love the different backgrounds and music that you can choose. I love that you can choose meditations based on how you are feeling and what you need at the moment. I love how the calendar keeps track of your meditation practice and it's especially nice that it will let you know when you're on a multi day streak (that makes me even more likely to meditate as it's like a reward to see that pop up after a meditation). I love how after any meditation the daily quote pops up. I love the mindfulness reminder that I've set to keep me on track. I love the woman's voice on the meditations (and I can be very sensitive and picky about voices). I love that there are night stories and many to choose from. This is a great app, I highly recommend it.I needed something. For years I needed centering. I‚Äôve always tried meditating but just couldn‚Äôt make it happen. I started with the free calm app. Tried the 7 days of Calm. 10 minute timed meditations. I skipped days, on days I did practice my mind wandered. Sometimes weeks went by before I practiced again. But every time I did it, it got better. I got more out of it. My anxiety lessened and then disappeared. Joyfulness snuck into my everyday life. Mindfulness has become a daily necessity for me. I just beat my streak and am progressing happily. Currently on a 140 day mindfulness streak and am so thankful for what I have learned through this app. No, you do not need it to practice mindfulness but the guidance has been so beneficial to my daily practice. I will never give this up and am thankful that I found this app.Like many things, I find that getting started is commonly the biggest barrier, and meditation has not been different. Finding the time, space, or even method to meditate used to deter me from doing it, and I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I was doing it correctly- which discouraged me from continuing the process. 

Calm has helped me enter a headspace which is relaxing, and the guided meditations give me just enough of an outline to lead me into a meditative state in seconds. The app also acknowledges when you get a daily consecutive streak, which I find very encouraging!

I would still consider myself a novice at meditation, but with the help of this app, it no longer feels like an impossible, scary thing. Thanks, Calm!I‚Äôve been on a streak since the pandemic hit. 1 meditation a day-sometimes I only have time for a 3 minute, and others I choose longer. I love the variety of classes to meet my emotional needs for each moment of my day. As a family, we complete a kid meditation and sleep story each night as part of our nightly routine. I have even started to incorporate some meditations from this app in my classes with my students! This app has completely changed my life! I also do gratitude tracking, mood tracking, and sleep tracking, and have seen way better sleep prioritizing, and reflection! I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough! (And I love that they partner with my health insurance company!) ‚ù§Ô∏èI never thought I could relax enough to mediate, but she made it very easy as she walks you through each session.  I also got frustrated in the beginning and thought I wasn‚Äôt doing things correctly and she explains that EVERYONE looses focus and everyone‚Äôs mind wanders and it‚Äôs ok, just go back to the breath.  Now I am on a 103 day streak and look forward to my mediation every morning before I get out of bed and if I feel anxious during the day I stop and do another and it helps me to relax and focus on now.  I also have learned to just take a few breaths and let go and that can help me stop the cycle of anxiety before it gets out of controlWhen 2018 began, I had few resolutions like everybody, meditation was one off them and I tried many apps and used 3 meditations apps daily one in morning, one afternoon & last one at evening. After a month's trial,I got rid of other and sticked to Calm. Not because others were bad but Calm's presentation was more alluring. It's style is more sophisticated than others. Music, stories, UI, everything is well made.

I have currently 300+ continuous streak. This app has winded down my days 'Calmly'. This app is must have for all & best example for how softwares can improve life. And thank you developers for such a masterpiece & I love Tamara Levitt's narration.I have listened to this app since I think 2015. I have almost consistently ever since I think my current streak is like 520+ days. I find that listening to the daily calm can be highly beneficial whether I meditate to it in the morning or the evening before bed. I have found myself resulting in calmness, for lack of a better term, ultimately remaining at peace through all the annoyances throughout my generally mundane day! I hope that this analysis contributes to the download of this app. I may be a particular case (as I'm sure I am), but I feel the benefits far outweigh the negatives.I like that there are personal stats like the number of minutes/hours of meditation completed and the longest streak of days in a row.  I have listened to the Calm app for 682 days in a row. My goal is five years in a row. I often listen to the music or the crackling fire or a purring cat. I have the daily new 10 minute meditation for dessert every day after lunch. I will often go to my saved favorites and listen to them again. I also enjoy the 10 minute spark interviews with guests. The interviews are varied and interesting. 
I never regret time spent with Calm. It‚Äôs an investment in myself and I am worth it!!I have the free sessions that Calm provides with the download of the app and I like it so far. I like that there are series to stay caught up with and that it tells you how long you meditated, how many sessions you‚Äôve completed and your daily streak. It allows me to focus on trying to meditate at least once a day. I also enjoy the fact that you can set a reminder to meditate at the same time each day. The voices that guide you through are also very enjoyable. If I continue to enjoy the app I plan on purchasing a subscription.This app, man, I can tell you has guided me through some of the toughest times in my life this past year. It‚Äôs taught me how to breathe. Yeah actually take full breaths, even when my anxiety wants to clench my breaths in. I love the streak system, it makes me keep on top of my game. Longest streak‚Äî25 days and counting! I‚Äôve made Calm App a part of my morning routine. Definitely recommend the premium subscription. Definitely worth the 1 time a year cost and you get access to anything you want. I still have things to explore on this app!I received a calm subscription as a school initiative, and have definitely taken advantage of all things Calm! I have now been practicing for about 6 months and have noticed myself being able to identify emotions as they arise, sleep better/earlier, and a sense of inner peace when I practice more than once a day. 
The app also has a great way to track your progress, see streaks, and check in with yourself each time you practice to notice any changes. 
I really enjoy this app!Great app to encourage more stillness in your day - where the majority is used to always moving on to the next. 
Slowly I am seeing myself become less reactive and more responsive from the skills I am building with this app. The skills are open ended and presented in ‚Äòfood for thought‚Äô format.

I understand that it takes resources to produce content of this quality, but this app verges on hostile towards the non-paying user, and some people just can‚Äôt afford to pay. I saw someone saying that the master classes were available, so I looked into that - um, no. It‚Äôs the *trailers* that are available, and this sort of bait-and-switch is typical of the non-paying experience in this app.

Second, I have chronic pain, and there isn‚Äôt any content that comes up when I search for that - there apparently isn‚Äôt anything health-related at all. The one free guided meditation I found started triggering panic as it made me more aware of my pain, and I had to stop. 

The upshot is that this app seems targeted towards a ‚Äúbeautiful person‚Äù demographic whose problems really will all go away if they start meditating. The series by Lama Rod Owens seems like a step in the right direction, but it‚Äôs going to take a complete reevaluation of the goals and design to really address the problem. Right now, if you‚Äôre disabled, broke, aging ungracefully, traumatized, or whatever, this app will constantly remind you that you don‚Äôt belong in the ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù space.You want the program to exude calm before sleep, yet many of your stories just do not meet your goals.  The Dragon Story is an excellent example of missing the mark. As a Counselor,  it is not a relaxing story at all. It depands attention, visualization that is mysteriously dark and it simply misses the mark on helping anyone reach a stage of calm. If you are serious about helping those prepare fir sleep you MUST make major changes. Changed must include the following: 
1. Have a Relaxation Exercise that emphasizes breathing techniques, Walk Through the Relaxation Exercises step-by-step. Never ask your users to automatically do them.
2. Get Rid of telling stories. You are forcing people to listen and the idea is to Turn Off the brain so slumber can flow.
3. Slow down music! Have you ever considered watching a yoga session or other relaxation programs offered at parks or recreation facilities? They are slow moving and quiet. Use that as your inner movement.
4. Look at your fabulous name, ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù. DO NOT GIVE UP. YOU WILL DO THIS! I will be in the midst of writing my book.

After trying free-trials of several apps I knew hands down this was the one for me. The selection of background sounds, and her soothing voice were exactly what I was looking for. The length of sessions are sufficient to fully relax and recharge yet not too cumbersome to fit into a busy schedule. I come to look forward to the sessions at the end of each day as my ‚Äúme time.‚Äù  I like that there are pre-programmed sessions aimed at specific topics or goals and there are daily sessions as well. The fact that the app keeps track of my progress helps to keep me motivated to never skip a day.   I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app, well worth every penny!!  I am hooked.I made mindfulness and intention my goals for 2021 and wanted to start meditating but didn‚Äôt know how or where to begin. I searched mediation apps and found Calm to be top-rated. Although skeptical of the whole practice, I started my free trial. I was hooked after my first Daily Calm session. Meditating, I learned, isn‚Äôt difficult, doesn‚Äôt require any special energy, and packs a mighty self-care punch. This app helps you rest and recharge in 10 short minutes a day (or more if you like!) I love the messages Tamara embeds in the Daily Calm, I love the thought provoking ideas Jeff brings to Daily Trips, and sleep stories really do help us sleep! My 10 year old listens to one very single night. I‚Äôm especially excited about the new Calm Kids feature and look forward to more kid‚Äôs meditations. This app has introduced life changing practices to my family over the last 9 months and I‚Äôm so grateful. We‚Äôll continue to renew each year. Would recommend for anyone 100%!I love all the various ways this app helps you relax and ease anxiety. But they really need to remove the competitive aspect or at lease use fluffy language to hide it. I don‚Äôt want to feel stressed out about not meeting my goals in meditation and mindfulness. When I see options listed that are labeled as ‚Äúcourse‚Äù or ‚Äúmasterclass‚Äù I am immediately stressed about excelling in mindfulness. There must be better language to categorize your playlists. Please üôÇ. Otherwise the app is great! I use it for kids bedtime stories as well (after I read 5 books and they are asking for more).I use Calm in the morning for meditation, daily Jay for inspiration and Mel for movement which gives me energy and gets me ready for the day. Using my Calm app every day keeps me in alignment with my goals and finding my peace early in the day. I look forward toUsing my Calm app each morning. I use the sleep stories and meditations for sleep when I go to bed and if I wake up in the night I turn them on again and it definitely leads to peace and allows for better sleep. Highly recommend calm appThe Calm app has been incredibly helpful for me to develop a mediation practice. I had tried off and on for over 20 years to try to Set aside time and develop a meditation practice, but it has never been very consistent for me until I started using the Calm app. Having the ability to turn into a daily meditation and set goals to complete the meditation programs has given me the framework to develop a consistent practice. If you are struggling with motivation, dedication, or education about beginning a meditation practice, I highly recommend the Calm app.",0,FurriliusNatmommablippi1001ajf'07MgD99,Daily sessions to look forward toLife changer: Perfect for BeginnersGreat app for familyGreat start to my dayimmensely helpful,CalmCalmCalmCalmCalm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,676,has_goals,11

When I purchased it something happened and they charged me twice for the app.  There wasn‚Äôt a way to contact them so I asked my credit card company to reverse the charges and they did.  Coincidentally at almost the exact time that the charge was reversed my app started performing horribly - it started killing my battery, literally to zero, after only playing 1 story.  For example, reviewing the battery usage indicator on my iPhone 10 says I‚Äôve used the app for 1 hour and used over 80% of my battery.  I have restarted my phone numerous times, loaded all the Calm updates, and have reported the issue to them via their help center.  I don‚Äôt believe in coincidences - I haven‚Äôt seen any reviews here that indicate this is an issue with anyone else.  This app developer must be a rouge programmer in his/her garage - scary stuff.  I‚Äôm going to get another refund if this performance problem doesn‚Äôt magically disappear.  And then I‚Äôm going to develop an app just like this to sell for a much cheaper price and compete with this product.  Shame on the price they charge for this app - that I have read in the reviews.You want the program to exude calm before sleep, yet many of your stories just do not meet your goals.  The Dragon Story is an excellent example of missing the mark. As a Counselor,  it is not a relaxing story at all. It depands attention, visualization that is mysteriously dark and it simply misses the mark on helping anyone reach a stage of calm. If you are serious about helping those prepare fir sleep you MUST make major changes. Changed must include the following: 
1. Have a Relaxation Exercise that emphasizes breathing techniques, Walk Through the Relaxation Exercises step-by-step. Never ask your users to automatically do them.
2. Get Rid of telling stories. You are forcing people to listen and the idea is to Turn Off the brain so slumber can flow.
3. Slow down music! Have you ever considered watching a yoga session or other relaxation programs offered at parks or recreation facilities? They are slow moving and quiet. Use that as your inner movement.
4. Look at your fabulous name, ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù. DO NOT GIVE UP. YOU WILL DO THIS! I will be in the midst of writing my book. If you would like to set up a meeting, please let‚Äôs discuss a date after 12/02One night, I was having a bad anxiety attack and I thought about downloading this app so I did and of course, i wasn‚Äôt thinking anything would be locked. As soon as I had got into my account, 90% of the stories were LOCKED. I was so mad because this is unfair to me. Basically everything is locked so this app is not for me and I‚Äôm very disappointed. If this app is for helping people, why should mostly everything be locked?! And I have to pay 70 dollars for premium? That‚Äôs ridiculous!! I don‚Äôt have much self-esteem and the self esteem stories were all locked, so I am pretty mad about that. I wanted to try a song. EVERY STORY IS LOCKED. I wanted to try a meditate story. EVERY STORY IS LOCKED. I wanted to try a sleeping story. ONLY 4 STORIES UNLOCKED. Do you not think that this is fair? I‚Äôve listen to all the stories that are unlocked without premium and I have to re-listen to them because everything is basically locked. This app is great and all, but basically everything is locked. The stories are good, but I have to listen to the same ones. Please unlock more. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it a 1 star and a negative review.I got this app to help me fall asleep, and all it does is frustrate me. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt paid for a full year‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to listen to 45 minutes of a sleep story when I‚Äôm going to sleep. I only need 15. After that, the story wakes me up. I don‚Äôt understand why this app has made sleep timers so difficult. You can set a timer to make the app go to sleep after a certain amount of time just playing the background sound, but it will still play the whole story. The only way to actually get a sleep timer is to play a story from a playlist, but I haven‚Äôt had that work consistently. Also, why can‚Äôt the app keep track of where I left off in a story or playlist? If you navigate away, it has no idea where you were. Which is extremely annoying for the playlists because if you want to use the timer, you have to restart them, otherwise they are treated as a single story with no sleep timer. I really thought this app would be better designed for sleep‚Ä¶ very disappointing.I would give this app a 0star if I could simply because while the app is free to download you can‚Äôt access any of the stories,meditations etc. without a subscription. They fail to mention this in any of their ads they push the free word a lot I find this to be very poor business practices. Yes they offer a 7 day free trial but if you do t continue the subscription the app is basically useless I found 2 things I could access without paying and even if you can download during the free trial once you cancel you only have what you could download and how many time will one want to listen to the same story/ meditation or whatever. I really feel they should explain in their ads that a subscription is needed the they are advertising to people with anxiety sleep issues etc so I feel it‚Äôs terrible business practice to offer people hope of some relief and then say oh but you must pay for it even though we said it‚Äôs free technically the app is free but it‚Äôs uselessPretty much everything on the app you need to pay for. I started using calm forever ago but very quickly ran through their EXTREMELY limited sleep story section.  They‚Äôll add a story for about a week and then lock it so only premium users can listen which is totally unfair. After listening to the same stories over and over again I was pretty much only using it for the soundscapes. Then I found an amazing app called Rain Rain which has more soundscapes and even lets you mix and match sounds. Calm is no longer downloaded on my phone and in my mind is basically just a waste of time unless you feel like spending whatever extreme price they‚Äôre charging. (Also if you are thinking of getting their premium membership beware, I‚Äôve read some horror stories about how they won‚Äôt let you cancel you membership or overcharge people‚Äôs cards)$70 A YEAR IS UNACCEPTABLE!
 for the lack of almost any free features in this app. I bet they are all amazing but I don‚Äôt subscribe to these things cause I don‚Äôt have the money so I‚Äôm just screwed?! I CAN‚ÄôT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE MEMBERSHIP!? This is just plain and simple, the people are telling me by not giving me a quality free app, with things to do and they  LOCK everything behind a paywall! that they say ‚Äúpay $70 a year and you may use it‚Äù but NO that‚Äôs not okay! The message that I receive when not using the membership is 
‚ÄúF**K YOU GIVE ME MONEY‚Äù I went in and thought I could just listen to a bedtime story but NO! Another thing is this look at it this way.. ‚Äúoh you wanna improve your anxiety and lower it? TOO BAD GIVE ME $70! Then you can reduce your anxiety‚Äù seriously that‚Äôs what this is. I heard I could do that for FREE and I WAS LIED TO. In short stop giving this 5 stars, 4 stars it doesn‚Äôt deserve it. WHERE IS THE HONESTY!?Calm tries very hard to cater to the emotional expectations of someone who doesn't yet understand what mindfulness is. It has ambient nature sounds, lots of voices trying really hard to be soothing, and an impressive hodgepodge of options. Unfortunately it doesn't really seem to teach much. A lot of time is spent on abstract personal anecdotes, celebrity humble brags, and portraying as many different ideas of mindfulness as possible. The very first ""How to Meditate"" session makes you listen to the teacher's life story and ideas for 3 minutes before actually explaining anything. There's no real structure or sense of progress, so there's not much to commit to. If you want to relax for 20 minutes, Calm may help. If you want to learn and deepen a practice that applies beyond those 20 minutes, look elsewhere.The app feels so unorganized. The types of meditation on the main page are all over the place: ‚Äúquick and easy‚Äù , ‚Äúrecent daily trips?‚Äù , ‚Äúeating stress‚Äù ‚Ä¶.oh and then random celebrities telling me a story mixed in (I personally DGAF what Matthew McConaughey or Shaun Mendes have to say, but I can see how that would he a nice touch for others) Then if you click into any of those, there are random durations (10 min, 7 days) and/or random people providing the meditations (a professional, an influencer‚Ä¶). I guess I‚Äôm looking for structure and consistency of some sort, even if just a pattern so I know where to look in the app once I find something that works. I‚Äôm coming here for help with help for anxiety afterall, just didn‚Äôt find it here. This was a disappointment given the price, back to headspace for me.The sleep story I tried was effective for helping me fall asleep, however these are only about 30 minutes long.  I woke up several times during the night and restarted the story, which worked, but if the story was longer, or if it could have been configured to repeat, it would be much less disruptive and possibly I may not have actually had to fully wake up.  

Another missing option is to have one of the ambient tracks, or anything, play automatically after the story.

The interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.

The subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.

For now I am going back to using boring Audible audiobooks played at .6 or .7 speed.   These play all night and never need to be touched once started.I‚Äôve been hearing about this app for MONTHS through ads. I struggle with sleeping at night and also anxiety and depression. So finally, i decided to download the app and I can only listen to ONE story???? And the man had a creepy voice. How am i supposed to play around with the app and see if it‚Äôs right for me when everything is locked and it‚Äôs basically FORCING you to spend an enormous amount of money. Yeah i could use the 7 day free trial, but I‚Äôve had bad luck with apps charging me as soon as i accept the free trial. 

 I‚Äôve never done a review but this made me mad enough to write one because I‚Äôve been so curious about the app and was so excited when i downloaded it only to be disappointed. I‚Äôm sorry but $70 for an app is ridiculous. I can‚Äôt believe people actually pay that much. Thanks for nothing!!Every time I start a sleep story it immediately downloads 30 mins of the track, and then stops. WHY NOT DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE THING?!?! This means that if I lose service or put my phone on airplane mode (which helps to make sure you really don‚Äôt get bothered) the end of the story doesn‚Äôt work. Now you‚Äôd think the download button would work but NO IT DOESNT. Even if I press the download button after starting the story it doesn‚Äôt work unless I stop the story entirely and restart it‚Ä¶only THEN does it have the end downloaded (not what I want to do when trying to go to sleep). One year ago I got this app and thought eh they‚Äôll fix this. STILL HAVENT FIXED IT. I‚Äôm done with Calm, going to headspace if this isn‚Äôt fixed soon.I can‚Äôt even start with how bad this app is. I will not pay for something that is supposed to be given once you download the app. It is one thing for maybe half the content to be locked unless you  buy it but it is another thing for 99% of the content to be locked. I found three sleep stories that were unlocked and they would put you to sleep not because they were calming and relaxing it boring and dull. There was literally a story called the rules of tennis. I would love this app if I didn‚Äôt have to pay for most of the things I should get for free. I do not recommend this app if you are not willing to pay for the content. This app was more trouble that it was worth.This isn‚Äôt a good app. They say it‚Äôs free but only like 1 story is free that you can‚Äôt even choose! Not to mention that the free stories are something like blue and gold and lavender fields? This is a scam. Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs free, then have me enter the app for ‚ÄúHundreds of calming stories for free‚Äù like you didn‚Äôt finish saying ‚Äúafter you pay $60 a year!‚Äù Wow now i can really take a deep breath upon entering the app. (sarcasm) Don‚Äôt forget you can do 7 or 21 days of happiness and stress relieving (and so on) Oh but the ones that are actually unlocked only really unlock one day of it. Like don‚Äôt you think that ruins the point of it? Because all of the 7-21 days link together to ‚Äúrelieve and calm you‚Äù This app is horible false advertisement. What a bunch of frauds for playing innocent people.The sleep stories are amazing! The readers and the stories put my right to sleep. But the main reason for my rating is that I expect when I tap on something it should actually do something. For example when the session rating pops up at the end of a story I cannot rate, close the rating pop up or even close the story. I have to close the app and reopen to continue using the app. Also I cannot turn off the background sounds when the app is open. I‚Äôm sure some folks like the clam sounds that play when navigating around the app but it‚Äôs kinda a distraction from getting to what I want and there is no option to turn it off.We have loved Calm Kids sleep stories for years and our kids loved it too. However, tonight I was listening to my daughter‚Äôs story and was surprised to hear that the main character had they/them pronouns. Im totally fine with that story being there if they had indicated what type of content was in the story and we could listen to it when ready, but the fact that they don‚Äôt mention it anywhere is a deal breaker. My kids are very young and we are not ready to talk with them about this subject yet. If a parent wishes to talk to their kids about that, no problem.

1,pos,2023-03-04 05:41:05,0,I saw the app has added new children sleepy time stories. I clicked to scour through what sort of story for children this app was playing. The entire story is about a fish who always felt different and met an aunt. An aunt who liked to wear pants and was different than all the other fish and the one no one wanted to talk to or about. How her parents never understood her and her friends. How meeting her Aunt Bubb allowed her mind to open into world of imagination she could take wherever she went. And only she and her friends knew about it though her parents never quite understood them. How free she felt being able to be understood by this group of friends. And how forever grateful she was for her aunt Bubb. I listened at how this story emphasized parents never really understanding her or her new friendships.,0,RebeccaO82,NOT FOR CHILDREN - GROOMING STORIES!!!,Calm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,152,has_narrative,287

It was so simple before, you wanted a sleep story? You could scroll through every one simply and fluidly. now they are all separated, train stories from nature from featured or whatsoever and you have to spend your time searching through multiple tabs, that shudder as you scroll, not fluid anymore, the last thing you want to do when you‚Äôre looking to get to sleep. And though on each there‚Äôs a See All tab, you only see all of that category - making it really difficult to just access all sleep stories. And these sleep categories are all buried among daytime use tabs, meditations, daily get up and go stuff, mental fitness. Who thought this was a good idea?? The layout design is too specified and difficult to just go and find what you want. Also, while I‚Äôm glad there is more kid content being added for parents it would be nice if they added other stories at the same pace, and also backed off some of the more cheesy approaches to new stories that seems to have begin to pervade. Bummer when a great thing is ‚Äúimproved‚Äù and made far less nice.I really liked this app at first. Eventually, I got bored of it. It‚Äôs cumbersome to find something I want versus what it thinks I want. I like Sleep Stories but more and more of them are sleep stories for children. Seriously, people only use this because they don‚Äôt want to bond with their children by reading them bedtime stories? The stories should be to help get adults to sleep. 

Just after I wasted $70 on another yearly subscription, the app suddenly will not keep playing a soundscape when I lock my phone. How is this useful? I am not going to leave my phone unlocked all night when I am trying to sleep. I love the Rain on Leaves soundscape but the app refuses me to use it to get to sleep now.

The app used to go back to the Sounscape after a sleep story. Now it‚Äôs silence. If your using the app to cover other noise, it‚Äôs now incapable of doing so. I just canceled (although I am out for over 11 months of the subscription) and deleted the app again. This is the third time I‚Äôve tried to give the app a chance.I love the idea of the app but I can‚Äôt afford it. I have trouble falling asleep when my boyfriend is out of town so I was looking into the app and the sleep stories and calming noises sounded awesome but I personally can‚Äôt afford a yearly subscription for unlimited access. If there were even 5-10 options for every single thing, the app would probably have more downloads. Or, a monthly $2-$5 subscription rather than it‚Äôs all coming out at once. It would save $10 a year minimum. And up to almost $50 a year. The app might even make more money and be able to reach poor teens who can‚Äôt afford stuff like myself. I have one subscription (that isn‚Äôt a bill). I can afford 2 $75+ subscriptions a year. I just wish is was more available to a majority of teens and young people or even busy parents who can‚Äôt afford stuff for themselves. A cheaper option might be great. Or do a 30second add before each story to make money and the upgrade includes no ads. Just some ideas from a poor teen that can barely pay bills and eat spaghettios twice a week...I formerly rated this app as a 5, and the app itself is great. I have been a subscriber for YEARS and up until now I‚Äôve been ok with the price increases because I use this app more than any other, HOWEVER now that they‚Äôve taken away family share, I will reconsider. I am not CALM about being charged more for less. Apparently leadership at Calm has lost sight of their original core values and succumbed to the ilk of Silicon Valley greed.  I will begin my review of other options and likely not renew. 

Sadly, here was my last review‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been a Calm customer for several years and I love it! My Calm app is with me throughout the day. I start my day with the Daily Meditation (and days that I don‚Äôt, I find I‚Äôm not as positive and prepared to face challenges), I listen to the music options while I work, and often end my day with a Sleep Story. As an entrepreneur, working to get a start up business off the ground, its important for me to find ways to keep myself grounded, and some days, my Calm app is the only thing helping me do that.I love the idea of this app, even after downloading and discovering what is available to you. BUT! The options I have are very very limited if I don‚Äôt pay for the premium Calm experience. Just like every other app, I am fully aware you can‚Äôt get the best of it without paying for a premium version, but with this app, your options are SO limited that you barely even have options if you don‚Äôt pay for premium. I can only listen to 1 story if I don‚Äôt pay for the premium version, and every other category options are just the same amount of limited. I was going to give this 3 stars for the regular version and not the premium version, but after further exploration on the app, I found myself even more disappointed with how many options I DONT have because I didn‚Äôt pay for premium. Other apps will let you explore more even without the premium version, but this one does not do that. Thanks for taking the time to read my review.I have had Calm for quite some time and they have gotten far too much of my money. The sleep stories are great, but the app is NOT intuitive or user friendly and there are no helps. It crashes at random times in the middle of a story or meditation, shutting off and going back to the home page of my phone or iPad. My daughter and I like the stories for kids the best, but they have added only 1 story in the past 4 months. It‚Äôs well nigh impossible to tell what subscription you have because there is a list of 15 different price renewal options. I found out mine has been auto renewing for $15 per month, making this literally the most expensive app in my life. For that much, there should be way better helps in the app and I should be able to use it for more than 4 mins at a time without it crashing, kicking me out, or freezing up my device.Would be 5 stars besides the fact that you can‚Äôt ask Siri to play the daily calm.   For example if you can‚Äôt sleep they are asking to open your phone (waking you up more!) to then open the app, select a sleep story, open the air play menu, then finally select a HomePod from the menu.  What‚Äôs even the point?  If I even glance at my fantasy league or some thing because I opened my phone for calm because I can‚Äôt ask my HomePod to just play calm.  The Siri shortcut is no better you have to continue on your iPhone, same thing look at your phone.  The money you pay this should‚Äôve been taken care of by now.  Apple has given the developer the tools with Sirikit media.  This is not unreasonable and for a app claiming to be about mindfulness you‚Äôd figure less screen time would be a top goal.  If this isn‚Äôt resolved by the end of my subscription year I won‚Äôt be renewing.  Content great, falls on app developmentIt may not seem like it at first , but this app does not have a wide range of different meditations. The library is shockingly small considering the price. They focus on celebrity gimmicks over quality and variety. I wish the sleep stories/meditations had options for audio overlay so you could adjust the sounds you‚Äôre hearing. E.g. I wish I could listen to binaural beats or crickets while a sleep story is playing, but instead it‚Äôs just silence. Or, I‚Äôll be listening to a sleep meditations and there are birds in the background, which makes me think of morning and isn‚Äôt what I want as I‚Äôm going to bed. Overall this app is such a disappointing experience, don‚Äôt waste your money. Only gave it two stars because there are a couple sleep stories I enjoy.I really liked this app and used the Lavender Valley sleep story all the time, but had to take a break from the Calm app for a little while, only to come back and find that I had to get Calm ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù to use it again. I for one think that meditation should be free for anyone to use and you should not have to pay. I understand that you have to make money, but at least don‚Äôt change what is free and what‚Äôs not. Also, I think that you should make it so you can buy each individual also sleep story, meditating, class, song, and anything else for like a dollar a piece. I think that would make more sense, be more convenient for the users, and still make you money. Please take the time to consider my review, and please do something about the expressiveness of this app. Thank you.I very much dislike how everything is for premium hardly will I ever find a story and I can‚Äôt even find music without having to buy a premium pass. This app is overwhelming me instead of calming me, I can‚Äôt find good music, I can barely find any stories, hardly is anything available. What if some people don‚Äôt have money? What if they downloaded this app to calm them because of that reason? People probably get anxiety more from this app than from curing it because they thought that they will have no app that will actually calm them without buying a premium pass. It‚Äôs ridiculously overwhelming me with how much I COULD HAVE read and listened too but I couldn‚Äôt because of you guys going over the line with this premium pass. There‚Äôs no hate I‚Äôm just giving you a word of advice.I‚Äôm about to delete your app. There is so many other apps that can do the same job with more free options or even lower prices. I‚Äôve been a calm user for 5 years or so? I‚Äôm not sure at this point, and I‚Äôve loved the app. It was great to finally get a good nights sleep. But it started getting popular, and I was even fine when the 2-3 free stories would change so one could get a variety even without paying. And you may never listen to the same story again, but I could live with that. Now, you only get one free story and NO free music. That‚Äôs it. Out of the Hundreds of songs and stories you get one. Or else you have to pay a monthly/yearly subscription for the rest. It‚Äôs stupid. I used to love calm, not it‚Äôs just a waste of space on my phone.If you love language, for the love of God stay away from the travel stories.  A more insipid collection of memoirs don‚Äôt exist. It is 2 am and I just couldn‚Äôt get through the cringe-worthy Yurt story. So I tried Morocco.  Do you people curate this stuff?  Maybe some listeners fall asleep giggling but I am grumpy at 2 am. 

Next most awful are the relaxation and sleep audio offerings that all say exactly the same thing. Get a writer.  Topping the list in this category is one sleep audio that almost put me to sleep until the narrator jumped in after a few minutes of silence and scared the bejeesus out of me.  Dude: once you go silent, shut your pie hole.  

Still, the classic stories are often read well and with grace.  Stick with these and you should be safe.My husband and I were looking for an app that might have some good sleep stories. We found this and at first we liked about a half a dozen different stories we heard but after that it was disappointing.
 The stories are mostly not interesting; remember you are listening to the first five or 10 minutes before you fall asleep (hopefully) of it so you do want the story substance to be a little bit engaging. I think the problem is that the made up stories are just so poor. The stories that are good are the ones that somebody else wrote that might be an excerpt from a book or a fairytale. Stick to those stories guys, because your made up stuff is bad.
Also Tamara Levitt's baby talk is very annoying.So, I‚Äôve seen the ads for this app, and I‚Äôm deeply disappointed üòî. I love that you can personalize it and stuff, it even gives you a Q&A beforehand, so they know what‚Äôs right for you. I get done with the questions, and open it up, before I look at ANY of the stories, it asked me to get a subscription..... and I thought that subscriptions were optional (that‚Äôs were I was wrong), I started looking at all the stories and I see that EVERY SINGLE ONE is locked until you subscribe. Not a single story is free.
And I was really excited to get this app, and it was a complete disappointment. I just feel like there needs to be a ‚Äúfree stories ‚Äù section for the people (like myself) who can‚Äôt afford a subscription.So I downloaded calm a year ago and absolutely fell in love. I would use a story time every night and loved the streak to hold myself accountable. I stopped using the app for a month or two. I am completely devastated. While originally there were only 5 or 6 sleep stories, now there are two (one that is targeted for younger children). The meditations have been cut down by an extreme amount. I feel guilty because I‚Äôve been recommending this app to people like crazy and they came back asking why I would recommend something with such a high membership fee. I just wish it still allowed a healthy place for those who can‚Äôt afford to pay such high prices for an appI wanted to try this out because I saw all the ad rolls on Facebook. Figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to see what I could get for free before maybe going for a subscription  It gives you one free Sleep Story and two free 5-10 minute mediations (The first of the 7 Days of Calm/Sleep respectively) but other than that, literally nothing else is free and they shove a subscription in your face. And a yearly one at that! Nothing else is even offered. I‚Äôm not paying $60 a year for something I saw barely anything of. Only giving this 2 stars because the one free Sleep Story they had was narrated by Stephen Fry, who can never do wrong.

I have really bad anxiety especially when I‚Äôm home alone trying to go to bed. The sleep stories on calm really calm me down and allow me to sleep 200x better. However, my main problem is there‚Äôs only one sleep story and nothing else no music, asmr, or anything that‚Äôs available to me on the free version, there‚Äôs really only so many times I can listen to the same thing and still fall asleep. I‚Äôd really love to see more available to those that can‚Äôt afford to pay for the premium version of the app but still love the app. Because this really does help with my anxiety it just makes me sad that there‚Äôs so many limits to the app because it helps so much!You have to pay for everything... there‚Äôs only around 2 things you don‚Äôt have to pay for... I recommend another app... I loved it when I had my free trial where I got a free story every night for a few weeks but after that it kinda just was just me listening to the things my souls machine would make... however it‚Äôs awesome for a portable sound machine because if you just pick which background sound (you will understand if you purchase) you like, and then go to the meditation part and it will just play that sound for however long you set it... but that‚Äôs really all you can do if you don‚Äôt do the whole subscription thing and all the monthly payments",0,MacantogeAnonymous 12418,Love the app but not the limitsExpensive,CalmCalm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,265,has_narrative,287

Please allow users to make their own sleep story playlists. I have certain sleep stories that I really enjoy however, I sometimes don't fall asleep before the story is over.  Having to engage with my phone when the story ends and encounter the ""Still Awake? Choose another sleep story."" screen mentally causes me to have to become alert enough to find another of my favorite stories and completely unravels the progress I've made to try and fall asleep.  I know you have curated playlists but I have my favorites and would like to create a variety of personalized playlists according to my preferences.  I also have sleep stories for my young son and would love to create playlists that include his favorites as well, which are much different from my own.  

This would be a great selling point for me and others to share with friends and family who do not currently use Calm.  I would greatly appreciate it if you implemented this feedback.

Calm regards.I love you. But please either let us make playlists or at least elect to have a soundscape start after the story ends (or run in the background at the same time, or whatever) so that I don‚Äôt get awakened by my air conditioner compressor kicking on or the neighbor‚Äôs dog barking and have to fumble with starting up rain on car windows or brown noise or whatever. 

My kids and I rely heavily on your app for entertainment/comfort as we drift off and background noise while we sleep, and at the steep subscription cost, I feel like I should either be able to select something to automatically come on after Erik Braa or Nick Offerman‚Äôs warm hug of a voice has rocked me to sleep. The playlists you have are not set up for 30-45 minutes of story and then 8 hours of soundscapes. Please make that change or give us the ability to request specific playlists. It would make my evenings and my kids‚Äô sleep much better.I have been a Calm subscriber for perhaps a year and a half now. I love using the sleep stories, especially to help me back to sleep after a middle of the night waking. I have two main sources of frustration & it all relates to the kids‚Äô stories. It seems like 75% of what is being released at this point is geared toward kids. I can see how it would be a great resource for parents, but for those users that don‚Äôt use sleep stories for their children it‚Äôs a lot of useless content. I also find it annoying that there is no apparent way to filter out kids stories, whether browsing thought the ‚Äúall sleep stories‚Äù page or in the recommended stories areas. I also occasionally find it difficult to differentiate which stories are geared towards kids unless I listen to part of the story. I love using calm, but it‚Äôs getting more difficult to justify the continued expense when it‚Äôs no longer catering to my demographic. Perhaps a separate calm kids app would be helpful.I have the paid version, and particularly like the sleep stories. They work so well, I usually fall asleep before the story ends. Problem is, I might wake up again a few hours later and want to pick up the story where I left off. But instead, I see the ‚ÄúStill Awake?‚Äù pop-up window suggesting other stories I might try, or maybe a meditation, and a pop-up asking if I‚Äôd like to rate that session, keep track of streaks and stats, etc. No, I‚Äôd really just like to find the sleep story I was listening to, but it has vanished from my screen. Now I‚Äôve got to sit up in bed, grab my reading glasses, X out of the intrusive pop-ups, and scroll through to re-find the sleep story that was snatched away from me....leaving me not at all calm, but instead, annoyed and anxious, and now unable to fall back to sleep. Can you please provide a way to turn off these very unhelpful ‚Äúhelpful suggestions‚Äù and gamification features? For me, they are defeating the entire purpose of this app, to CALMLY fall asleep.I purchased the premium app a few months ago and was able to use it a few times. The wi-fi at my house is satellite, so sometimes stories will not load or the app freezes. I had to get a new phone recently due to my old one getting hot, the screen dying, and eventually die altogether.

So, with my NEW phone, I download the app and within 2 minutes of it loading and scrolling through stories my phone feels super hot to touch. I paid for the year, so wanted to be able to use the app. Though, I don‚Äôt relish the idea of ruining  my phone in the process. I never noticed previously when my case was on the phone, but it hurt my hand how hot it became. So, can only imagine after running sounds or a story for a while what could happen over time. 

I love your UI, the content is great, the heavy load and CPU performance could certainly use work. I‚Äôd be equally happy with less fancy animations and graphics if it meant it was faster and didn‚Äôt run the risk of destroying my processor.I used to rave about Calm to my family and friends a while back, telling them how helpful it was for insomnia, meditation and relaxing. My personal favorite sleep story is ‚ÄúThe Waterfall‚Äù. (I still don‚Äôt know the ending because it always put me to sleep within 5 minutes!)

Another thing I loved about Calm was the number of features available for free. Although I couldn‚Äôt afford the annual fee, the free items were VERY helpful to me. Now, I‚Äôm greatly disappointed that most of those free features are now paid features, including ‚ÄúThe Waterfall‚Äù. 

It would be great if Calm at least offered a monthly payment option. The subject of mindful meditation, mental health, etc. is no longer taboo and on the rise and people of all incomes need resources available to them. I don‚Äôt fault Calm for charging for most of their features, but with the app ranking at #1, they should make more features available for people who cannot afford to pay a fee.I‚Äôve been using this app every night for a week now and I will say that when it comes to the story section, majority of the people they have reading those stories don‚Äôt really have a soothing, soft voice to help put you to sleep and I‚Äôve seen others complain about that feature also so hopefully they can make some changes. I love the nature sounds like rain and campfire especially since I can set a timer and they will continue to play even when I exit the app! Another thing I love is the lullaby section but I‚Äôm so disappointed that there‚Äôs only 4 to choose from and the only one that puts me to bed/makes me tired is lullaby to the stars. PLEASE add more lullabies that are softer and mellow like lullaby to the stars but please more lullabies would be amazing!!! Overall the app is good but considering I paid for the premium I just wish there were more sounds to choose fromI decided to purchase it primarily for sleep stories. And after my free trial has expired I realised that I am stuck with primarily stories recorded by people that have no business recording sleep stories. At least there should be different voices categories. I realised that I am deeply annoyed by high pitch whispering and the ‚Äú S‚Äù sounds pronounced unnecessarily loud making me jump in bed each few seconds. Calm app makers! Please hire more people with sweet and velvety voices that are ACTUALLY soothing or adjust audio recording to smooth those sounds out. ( or put it as an option for listeners)There is a reason every classical singer out there is trained to smooth their Ts and Ss so the songs are actually enjoyable.
So far the only truly soothing story I found was read by Matthew Mcconaughey. That‚Äôs a lot of money to pay for very little use I am getting.I wish users can have a choices of narrator voice . The voice of the lead person Tamarra, is too cheerful and has too much emotion in her voice. It is like she is telling a cheerful and colorful story. Many people may prefer such a bubbly character, but for someone who feels anxious, that‚Äôs bad news for a guided meditation. It is not that I don‚Äôt like her voice, it is that the energy and emotion in her voice makes me more anxious. I bought one year subscription and tried to get used to it. But it didn‚Äôt work. As a result, I don‚Äôt use the Apps much at all. 

I would prefer a more traditional, calm and almost emotionless voice. Some of the work offers a choice and I always choose the alternative male voice. But given that her voice accounts for 90% of the guided medications, I will not renew my subscription.Great meditations, but extremely annoying glitches. When searching through the meditations, it doesn‚Äôt show which ones you‚Äôve completed. And there is no way to mark one as completed yourself. So you‚Äôre looking through ones you‚Äôve already done, and you have to just remember every one you‚Äôve done. 
Also for series, when you open the app, there‚Äôs no option to start the next meditation in the series. So I go to last completed my history, thinking there‚Äôs some ‚Äúcontinue to next‚Äù option. Nope, can‚Äôt do that either. And there is no option to search. So every time you want the next meditation in a series, you have to scroll until you can find that series again, and remember which one you‚Äôre on. 
As much as I love the meditations, I probably will not purchase again next year unless changes are made.I was attempting to use the app and there is almost no content for me to use other than two sleep stories that are short and the one is a kids story. I wish there was like 5 or 6 free stories for me to use. I don‚Äôt want to pay $70 a year to use an app to help me sleep better. That is just too expensive for me and I don‚Äôt understand why. Why are people expected to pay $70 for help sleeping. I would like to use this app and its many features but I can‚Äôt do so without paying for it. One of the stories that is free is a moshi monster story and I feel as though that won‚Äôt help me fall asleep. I wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the stories. Maybe a free trial would work, I just can‚Äôt see myself or anyone else paying to listen to stories. I would love to use and support this app, but I can‚Äôt give a fair review without paying for it.I did the trial and really liked the sleep story options so I went ahead with the purchase. Unfortunately the trial may not have been long enough for me to realize that most of the other content is unusable for me because of Tamara Levitt‚Äôs voice. Like many other reviewers I really can‚Äôt stand it. If you are looking into this app as an option for you for more mindfulness I‚Äôd recommend listening to one of her meditations just to make sure you jive with her voice. If not, she‚Äôs virtually impossible to avoid. I don‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth because of it. Also, it would be nice to have more ASMR options. The current offering are ok, but not totally in line with what I would consider ASMR. If the app developers are reading this, please consider ‚Äúdaily calm‚Äù options with different voices.This is a worthwhile app, however it has limited fiction stories for adults. Some of the children‚Äôs fables have been interesting and some not. Adult stories like The Time Machine, Gulliver‚Äôs Travels, Gift of the Magi were wonderful. There were interesting, but I was not so engrossed in the story that I could not drift off to sleep. Most of the nonfiction stories do not engage my mind enough and thus my mind starts to wander. One app category is fiction stories but the majority of stories listed in this section are nonfiction. Seems like it would not be hard to keep the categories straight.  I Had not planned to renew because I found another app with more adult stories but I missed the deadline and was already charged. I will keep one more year and hope for more adult fiction.It‚Äôs a nice app I can tell because I‚Äôve had a subscription for a white but wasn‚Äôt able to pay for it anymore. I‚Äôd like to take time to say it‚Äôs good enough except you have to pay for everything. Some things such as special things like music is free stories free etc. but maybe stuff like getting up so and so and so. Could cost money. Of course this is just an example of something you may have other ideas but this one really hits my mind when I see this app on tiktok, insta, Tv ads, Etc etc. in all. Pay for some don‚Äôt pay for others. I hope you find this message helpful even though I know you‚Äôd most likely not change anything. If you think about it even one thing such as story‚Äôs or music get back to me :) have a very nice day.Music is often stressful for me, or agitates me, so the inability to turn it off in stories makes those sleep stories useless to me. And I sometimes need a while to fall asleep 20/30 min is not enough. A loop function or ability to build a playlist is a feature I really need in a sleep app.

 
I have another app that both allows me to turn off (or control the volume separately) background sounds and music, and to loop my story. I ended up canceling Calm for the other app. I have Calm again because my phone plan gave me a year free, but I never use it because of the missing features. But the other app has more features, and better functionality for half the price. Step it up Calm!I am not sure what happened but this formerly indispensable app has been deleted from my phone. I have been unable to use any of the sleep stories for almost 7 weeks- most do not load and none of the ones I choose to use will play. Instead I get the app‚Äôs version of Windows spinning hourglass or a message saying that Calm is unavailable. I have tried at different times of the day and the same thing happens. Very frustrating. Last night after trying for a half hour, I shut the app down. This AM, I was awakened by a random sleep story playing- first time it has worked on over a month. I paid for a year‚Äôs subscription so will delete and download/reinstall again later but I have no hope that it will work. Get whatever it is fixed!So look I‚Äôm 15 and as many of you should get an idea I don‚Äôt have a debit card and I really like the idea of this app and it does help BUT I hate that their is only one option when I need actually a little bit more I get it the creators need money but their is a better way, first is if you open up a bit more people will actually use it and keep it because when I first got it I looked and saw only one story was open which I was just gonna delete the app but I gave it a try and I loved it but many will not give it that one try. Another way is if you put ads so people can watch for in app credit so over time they can accumulate enough to buy one story section, which from the adds the creators will get more money.Okay, I usually do not leave reviews‚Ä¶. However i felt this deserved a review. The children stories are cute‚Ä¶ however, after listening to a few of them with my 18month old and 3 year old I noticed they like to slip in ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù ideologies‚Ä¶ one story has the main character using They/Them pronouns, one story has Gay badgers‚Ä¶ each story seems to have something slipped in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm all for the LGBTQ+ community however I believe children should not have to have gender confusion thrown their way. I won‚Äôt be letting my kids listen to these stories anymore because they should be focusing on kid stuff, not gender and other things. Im happy to go back to reading the old fairy tales to my kids myself.Ca has a lot of wonderful tools for mindfulness, grounding, centering.

I, however, subscribed to the premium for help with sleep.  I grew up with my sister reading us to sleep and was thrilled there was an app with stories.  That said, there are no sleep timers embedded in the stories, so they run to the end and nothing.  Further to that, the app doesn‚Äôt play the next track/story!  So if you‚Äôre still awake, or wake up and can‚Äôt get back to sleep, you have to search through kingdom come to get back to stories and pick one you haven‚Äôt heard 6 times already (and they always suggest the same one).  I‚Äôm more awake than ever.  

Please embed sleep timers and consecutive tracks!!!People who truly have a hard time sleeping need a story to repeat. This is not an option even when paying for this app. I have to restart the story over and over when I‚Äôm having a rough night. The app is not user friendly. I have to search and search for things that might be a good story and I mostly find short half hour stories. I need longer ones and I have to search for them. I am giving it 3 starts because I have found a story I love to listen to and there is a ton to try. We all have our own taste of calming stories but once I found it I wish the app made it easier to find and allowed it to repeat.I like the sleep stories and use the app primarily to help fall asleep.   They do have a couple 1.5 hr ‚Äúanthology‚Äù stories, but I‚Äôd like to be able to pick 2-4 stories, put them in a cue, and play those three or four till I fall asleep.   Or put one on an infinity repeat etc‚Ä¶.  The way it is set up now, if I‚Äôm still awake at the end of a story I need to turn my phone back on, scroll through to find the next one I want to hear and start again, which really starts over the falling asleep process.  It would be great if I could select four, and have it play all those before turning off.It‚Äôs a real shame that almost everything on the app is locked :/ The only thing that I can play are the scenes. Thank goodness I can fall asleep to them still. However, I had a free subscription one time and I listened to this story and it was the BEST story ever. It helped me sleep within 5 minutes whereas the scenes put me to sleep a hour later. Very sad that nowadays everything has a price to it. Even your own sleep. I wish in the future you guys will change your ways and unlock if not most of the stories then just a few. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people actually depend on this app for their own rest and peace of mind. Have a good night üòûü§çI‚Äôve had this app since 2017 and absolutely loved it. I have some nights where it‚Äôs horribly difficult to fall asleep and the different sleep stories allowed me to wind down really well. Now that I‚Äôm in college, my stress has gotten worse and my nights have become way long and calm no longer helps because it‚Äôs the same single sleep story that I have available to me. It‚Äôs really such a shame that this has turned into a money juicer rather than the lovely helpful app that it was. If lowering the cost isn‚Äôt an option, at least make more of the stories, meditations, and plans available. At the very least the daily calm. Love the app, just don‚Äôt have enough use for it now.Wonderful app. I was thisclose to subscribing when an update wrecked my primary use of it. I know there's a sound fetish movement out there that includes a certain singsong vocal quality and whistling S sounds and so on, but the point of ""sleep stories"" is to fall asleep. The newly re-recorded stories are just awful - especially my former favorite, ""The Waterfall."" The whistling S's are like nails on a chalkboard. The exaggerated singsong might be good for a children's story but is highly distracting. And I notice the same thing has been done to ""Blue Gold"" now. Are the previous versions of these stories available to Premium subscribers? Are there any Premium sleep stories that don't have this fetish quality now?I used Calm for many years. I already meditate, so I didn‚Äôt use many of the meditation programs. I liked the idea of a daily meditation, such as the Daily Calm, but I can‚Äôt abide the speaker‚Äôs voice. It is so affected, I longed for different voices. (Others must have spoken up, because some of the sleep meditation assistance used other voices, but I found those dry and clinical.) The most distressing aspect about the app is its commercialism. I really don‚Äôt care about movie stars and famous people being recruited for sleep story narration and trainings. But that seems to be the direction Calm is headed. I liked it for a long time. I just found far more variation and less commercialization elsewhere.I absolutely love this app, I can‚Äôt sleep without it. The nights that I toss and turn or my mind won‚Äôt turn off, I put a story on and fall asleep in minutes. I use the free version but I have heard the same story so many times I end up reciting it to myself instead of falling asleep. I would love to subscribe to it but it is just TOO EXPENSIVE. I only use the stories and not the other features. I would love if I could subscribe only to the stories or certain features. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider a cheaper option. Or purchasing certain stories or features without the subscription.Please update this app to let the user put sleep stories in a queue. I don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt a thing. I listen to a sleep story then wake up when it‚Äôs silent and playing another story requires I get my glasses and choose one and select it - thus waking me up fully. Also, please let us sort stories by length! I also wish I knew which narrators had a British accent and which ones don‚Äôt. I find the British accent to be not as relaxing some nights and I‚Äôd love to be able to sort by this. These are the things that will prevent me from renewing my subscription come 9/20 if they aren‚Äôt resolved - at least the queue issue.I think the app and the concept is fine. I understand that companies have to make money and 70 dollars for a whole year isn‚Äôt all that bad. However my issues lie when I have to pay so much money TO HEAR TOMMMMM. all I want in this world is for Tom Hiddleston to read me Winnie the Pooh, but not for 70 dollars and I will forget to cancel the trial and be charged a million dollars. Would it maybe be worth it to feel like he‚Äôs there and reading me a bed time story? Yes, but not 70 dollars. So calm, either up your prices to a million dollars or hire a personal bed time story meeting.

I have found about A dozen stories on here that really work well for that. Those are the only ones which have soothing and not annoying voices, enjoyable content, and are written for adults.I wish there were more like this but this many are truly awesome and help me fall asleep when I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance without it. The other drawback to the app is that when your story ends you can‚Äôt just play it again without activating your brain much because it is always suggesting other stories or asking you to check in, it would be a lot better if it would just stay on the screen you‚Äôd chosen and all you would have to do is press play. Also I work in the wilderness during the summer so there‚Äôs no service at all. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to play the stories I have downloaded, but other times for some reason they all vanish from my liked page and some or all of them will not be playable from the all page either.I like this app, I put it on at night and listen to the free stuff, but that‚Äôs the thing. Just the free things. I can‚Äôt pay anything, so I have to find anything that‚Äôs free to listen to. There‚Äôs only like one or two free stories, and one is a little kid‚Äôs story about a snuggly panda. Something good about this app: You can tell it your mood and write about how you‚Äôre felling and why. It‚Äôs like a more digital and private version of a diary. Also,  I do like having something to listen to, and Steven Fry‚Äôs voice is pretty calming, but that‚Äôs all there is to listen to. So, unless you‚Äôre willing to pay 60 something bucks a year, or are ok with having a very limited amount of things to listen to, you should think about your decision before you get this app.This is a great app with lots of options! One thing it‚Äôs missing (which I‚Äôve found to be VERY helpful on another similar app called Breethe), is the ability to have music or stories be shuffled or auto-repeated (either once, or until you choose to stop it). I have a tough time sleeping, but do better when I can hear a soft voice talking (or other soothing sounds) throughout the night. I most often fall asleep during a story (yay!), but as soon as the story or music ends on this app..I wake back up. So I started using the Breethe app for sleep because I can choose to have either stories or music be repeated over and over..and thus, I sleep longer! I‚Äôd most likely use the Calm app more often if it included this option.Great quality sound and video clips and I'm amazed at how effective stories are at getting me to fall asleep. The developers have also taken care to add lots of good content. I cannot tell where audio files loop but I can for some of the video content, but it's more important they got the audio right than the video.

Only complaint I have about using the app is that I wish I could set one of the sleep sounds to come on after a sleep story. For some reason, even though I fall asleep while listening to a sleep story, I wake up when it stops. I then have to open the app,
 select a sleep sound e. g. waves and then resume my sleep. Should be possible to have a sleep sound come on when a story ends.

My biggest complaint about this is that the developers are a bit greedy. I could swallow the $ 60 price tag, but I can't share it with a family member. Not even a spouse? At this price, not being able to share it seems a bit greedy and destroys the goodwill generated from using the app.",0,TetonRyderJane DeerZero-GPeterAnthony,"Pretty awesomeLike it, but the membership thing is annoyingGreat App!..but needs auto repeat abilityGreat but overpriced",CalmCalmCalmCalm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,677,has_narrative,287

For example, we listen to the same Eric Braa episodes every night, but now they have moved them out of the instant display of my faves and buried them so I have to search for them in the middle of the night.  They no longer have new Eric Braa episodes and his voice is so soothing.  The recently used episodes should appear near the top of the category list so we can find them easily, not on the home page!  Give us a way to make our own category(s). Give us a way to remove all the children‚Äôs stories from the adult content.  Give us a way to totally delete content that is a trigger for us.  And finally, in the middle of the night, a dialog sometimes pops up that I have to put my glasses on to read so I can dismiss it!  That should NEVER happen.  I wish someone would listen.  I used to give feedback on each new story, but it never did any good so I stopped.  I don‚Äôt feel they listen anymore and I‚Äôm disappointed.Everything about this app is excellent. I used to dread laying in bed, trying to calm my mind for sleep, but now with the calm app I look forward to my sleep story and soundscape every night. However for the way I use calm there is one major shortfall in the app. There is no way to line up a queue or playlist of recordings. I will make it to the end of a sleep story, be close to sleep but not quite there and then have to search through the app again to turn on my soundscape. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal but for me who has always had trouble falling asleep it is very disruptive. It is also disruptive when I use the app to help my 10 yr old son fall asleep- I put on a sleep meditation for him, but he always wants a sleep story to follow. I either have to stay in his room through the whole meditation so I can start the sleep story, or he has to climb down from his bunk bed to do it, disrupting the calm we just established with the meditation. This app is so thoughtful in so many ways I am surprised and disappointed they have not found a solution for this yet.When I downloaded this app I was delighted at the surprising approach to relaxing at bedtime: Sleep stories for adults! Genius! At first I thought the idea was silly but was sold after a couple evenings of stories. I subscribed for the year. I was really looking forward to the Daily Calm, too. 

Stories with wonderful readers like Anna Acton and Stephen Fry are pure heaven. Sadly, it‚Äôs Tamara Levitt‚Äôs voice that made me cancel my subscription. I feel awful saying this but it‚Äôs true. What is perhaps an attempt to sound soothing comes across as phony affectation. It‚Äôs grating. As a result I can‚Äôt listen to the Daily Calm. When my partner chose a story read by her one evening he and I were just minutes in before he asked for one read by someone else (without me having expressed my opinion about her tone of voice). 

This is a solid app. If the content she curates is read by others, however, it would be a GREAT app. I would happily resubscribe if the readers and voices at Calm were less Tamara and more varied.I absolutely love this app. I have OCD and constantly struggle with anxiety. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it better during the day, but at night, since I‚Äôm laying still, I have time to stop and think. Which turns into worrying and panic attacks. I usually take sleeping medicine for it, but then I started using the bedtime story part of the app, and it helped me to relax and fall asleep without having to take medication. Only thing is the pricing. I‚Äôm a college student and a part time nanny, and the pricing to unlock the full app is insane. I would love to continue to use the app since it‚Äôs helped me so much, but I only have to option of 3 stories to listen to, and it‚Äôs starting to drive me crazy I‚Äôve heard them so much. Even though I love this app, I‚Äôm not using it anymore, and will probably delete it. If they could lower their prices to where more people have the option to use the full app, I think it could really flourish.Since it‚Äôs launch, my son and I use Calm religiously. We love it; however, I am becoming frustrated because every time I open the app at the end of the evening I am bombarded with choices for my child since he was the last user. He constantly on favorites pieces that I have favorite because he thinks he is on his account, and I lose my favorites category to choose from because sessions come and go. Please add the capability for family accounts, or for my son to access his profile so I can access my profile, this would help immensely reduce the frustration of having to filter through content that is not related to either of us when trying to choose a sleep story a soundscape or music at bedtime.My 10 year old daughter has separation anxiety at night and listening to these sleep stories has dramatically helped her to fall asleep on her own. However, we‚Äôve gone through all of the stories that she likes (her preference is driven by both the sound of the voices and the story line) and she isn‚Äôt one to listen to the same story over and over each night. Content is not added as frequently as it should be, and she complains that the voices with accents are hard to understand. We will continue to try this one out as we‚Äôve tried other similar apps and she says those are boring compared to Calm, but I really hope they consider added more/new kids sleep stories.I bought the premium subscription. While I enjoy what it offers, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the money. I use it primarily for falling asleep. I like the sleep stories but they aren‚Äôt long enough. It‚Äôs counterintuitive to have a sleep story that‚Äôs so short you have to open the app again to continue playing stories. I would like something that‚Äôs long enough to still be playing even if I wake up an hour or more later or at least it appears on the Lock Screen to repeat. For people with true asleep disorders, the app currently defeats the purpose. 
Also, ads slow soothing visuals but these are not actually on the app. Not sure why they‚Äôre on the ad if not available on the app.This app is amazing. This is my first night of sleeping using this app and it worked! Every night when I sleep, I just feel like I can‚Äôt fall asleep. But this one made me fell asleep in a crack! I wasn‚Äôt even that sleepy. 
The thing is, I don‚Äôt wanna spend money to buy premium. And if I don‚Äôt, there are barely any stories that are not premium. I think because there are barely any stories, you should HAVE to buy premium and that‚Äôs just wasting money and giving the money to this.
Because of this, I only rate 4 stars. It‚Äôs like I have to listen to the same stories over and over again. There is probably only 1 story in each category. Please fix this and add more non-premium ideas.I‚Äôve been using the subscription version for almost a year.  I will renew.  The sleep stories are fantastic.  The daily calm messages are helpful.  There is a lot of variety within the app.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are 2 things I would change... the white font on light gray background is hard to read.  It would be nice if we could select colors or shades or contrast.  The 2nd would be background music during sleep stories - either let the background scene noise continue to play during the story (as an option) or add an option for sleep music.I love the sleep stories. They usually put me right to sleep, and if I don‚Äôt fall sleep within the story, I‚Äôm so relaxed that I fall asleep soon after. The only reason I gave this app a 4 and not a 5 is because you can‚Äôt just purchase single sleep stories; you have to get a monthly subscription. So, I‚Äôve been listening to the same 2 free stories since I found this app. Now it‚Äôs just 1 free story. I don‚Äôt need a monthly subscription, but if you need this to help fall asleep every night, then I guess the subscription might be worth it. Message to the Calm app people: Let us purchase single stories. Please!I mostly love this app but have been less delighted with the relatively recent change of the background sounds from rain softly falling to the cacophony of birdsong in a forest. What I‚Äôd like to see is an ability to choose from a selection of background sounds; say the aforementioned rain, waves on a beach, the wind through the trees of a forest and yes, for those who find it relaxing, the birds as a default. Also, after a sleep story ends, sometimes it fades to silence (my preference) but sometimes it switches back to those noisy birds, which negates any relaxation or sleep attained through the story. Fade to silence - always!I do really like calm. It is a little frustrating how they keep minimizing the lite version of it. There used to be five stories you could listen to without premium, but now there is only one. I mainly use it for background noise (rain, water, etc.) but sometimes I like to hear a story and now it‚Äôs just the same one on repeat. I don‚Äôt use it enough to activate a premium account. So if you use it often and really delve into it, I would recommend a premium account. It is still a nice app to have however just for once in a while uses!I actually really like this app. The sleep stories helped a lot with my insomnia and there are other options for meditation, mental clarity etc. however, with ALL the stories, sessions and albums they have shown on this app, 95% of them are locked and can only be accessed if you sign up to pay 70$ for the year. It was challenging finding a session or story that wasn‚Äôt locked and didn‚Äôt have much options. I believe they help and I‚Äôm debating on paying, I just wish I had more options before deciding.",0,tanglepuffsYirah02Flyte99Mikayla629JCAJ_15BossMom41PediOTKawaiikiettyMBRUTCHEYMaslow3JBurdonjulietlorentzdnRacheldoe,"So disappointed latelyLove this app but has significant shortfallI almost love this 100% but...Great app, but pricing is too much.Please Add User Profiles within the AppGood sleep stories, but need to add content more frequentlyWorth the money?Sleeping problems solved!

Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation & sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep & in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep &  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that. I don‚Äôt know that would be my only recommendation, but overall and amazing app that‚Äôs worth the price.This App is my absolutely favorite to use when I‚Äôm going to sleep. I got it solely for the sleep stories and I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed. It‚Äôs like being a kid again and getting a beautiful story read to you by a soothing voice. While I use the app mainly for sleep stories I‚Äôve used the meditation, background music, and breathing exercise options on the app as well. I used to use Headspace for a lot of my meditation sessions but with Calm having so many additional features I switched over fairly quickly. 

The only problem I have with this app is that I can‚Äôt set up a playlist/cue of the stories I want to fall asleep to. Sometimes I can‚Äôt fall asleep right away so I have to go through the process of unlocking my phone, setting up another story, and trying to settle down once again just to set up another story to be read. It quickly becomes irritating, especially on nights when I can‚Äôt fall asleep easily and have to go through the process of setting up an additional three stories and eventually giving up in the end. 

So if that can somehow be added then it‚Äôll get my full 5 stars. But having nights where I‚Äôm on and off my phone throughout the night definitely makes me feel frustrated enough to keep it at 4 stars.I love the Calm app. I‚Äôve had it for years and love all the changes the app makes with the premium version. I‚Äôve used all the features including the meditation but mostly use the sleep stories. I have insomnia and the sleep stores are the only thing that help me fall back asleep more quickly. I listen to the Calm curated playlist as I like to listen all night. The playlists haven‚Äôt been updated in a while and I would really love the option to make my own or at least have a play all downloads feature.  I have made suggestions over the years to allow users to curate their own playlists but this option isn‚Äôt available yet. Please make that update next. I wake often and end up having to find another sleep story to listen to in the night since I can‚Äôt auto set another to play when one ends. I love the app and all the content. I really wish this feature would be done. It‚Äôs the only thing keeping the app from being perfect.I‚Äôve had a couple of different doctors recommend Calm and finally decided to try it. I‚Äôve had chronic insomnia since childhood and was very skeptical, so I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The sleep stories are my favorite feature, but I often find that the story ends just as I‚Äôm drifting off, so I have to start another one, which completely wakes me up again. The anthologies have been great since they are longer and I‚Äôm more likely to be fully asleep when they end. Can we please have more long stories or anthologies?? Or could you develop a feature that allows me to queue several stories so I don‚Äôt have to manually start another?? If that feature already exists, please tell me how to find it and use it!! To those who complain about the cost...if you really cared about good sleep and how it benefits your health, you would think $5 a month is a bargain!! That‚Äôs what most of us pay for a generic prescription med to help us sleep!This app is amazing and helps me fall asleep very quickly, the voices are amazing and so is the scenery, pictures and music this app gives. I use the sleep story a lot at night and I really think you guys should unlock premium stories for a couple days because I am so use to hearing ‚ÄúThe Waterfall,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlue and Gold,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Secret Lagoon.‚Äù I am 100% not saying they are bad stories because they are amazing. I just wish I could choose from different stories every once in a while instead of hearing the same stories over and over again each night. I also wanted to speak about the pricing, it is a little too over priced, mind you, I‚Äôm only 15 and there would be no way I could ever pay that price without a card of some sort. I overall love the app, from the start the story to finish, this is absolutely one of the best sleep story and meditation app I have ever downloaded. 4 Stars since the pricing and locked stories.Has some lovely calming images and sounds, and the unlocked bedtime story to which I listened had a a soothing voice. There many unlocked sessions I would like to hear and wish the owners would at least give a sample of the voice and then allow me to purchase the episode to own it, rather than requiring  a pricey (for me) yearly  subscription, for which the product is forever gone when it runs out. I know subscriptions are becoming the way of the world, but still I resist!  I do believe people should be paid for their work; I‚Äôd just like to be able to actually purchase a product; I would rate five stars if they would allow this. 

‚ÄúCalm‚Äù has a nice daily feature (one of the few push notifications I allow on my phone) which reminds me to stay in the moment, breathe, etc.   The app has some generous free offerings and I thank thank the developers for sharing these!Amazing app. I use sleep stories every single night and my toddler uses the kids sleep stories at nap time. It‚Äôs so relaxing! I am actually excited to jump into bed at night because I get to listen to a story! I also use the ten minute daily calm meditations all the time! There is so much value in this one app- sleep stories, daily journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, and more! My one suggestion is to add more emotions to the daily check-ins. Most of the time I‚Äôm feeling an emotion and it‚Äôs not one of the choices. So I just have to pick one and make it work. For example, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfrustrated,‚Äù ‚Äúguilty,‚Äù ‚Äúoverwhelmed,‚Äù ‚Äúsurprised,‚Äù ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or ‚Äúcurious,‚Äù etc. I wish there were more emotion choices to better describe how I‚Äôm feeling. Otherwise, everything else is perfect! I love this app and I tell everyone I can about it. I would gladly pay $100/year for this app.It‚Äôs the #1 app for anyone who uses it infrequently or who is a first-time user. I‚Äôve experimented with a couple meditation apps but have found this one to be the best in many ways. I was introduced to mindfulness and meditation through this app and it was very insightful in the beginning. I‚Äôm a yearly subscriber and am currently on a 370+ day streak (great gamification feature btw)

Frankly, the more I use it the more dull it gets. I haven‚Äôt seen much change since I first used it a few years ago. Even looking through the update history it‚Äôs a copy-paste about the app rather than what the update entails. It does feel like not much has changed. 

I‚Äôd be great to see some bugs fixed, meditation searches more intuitive, a better save library - maybe letting users have their own playlists for different types of meditations, and, in my opinion, adding more variety of meditations and series rather than getting big names as narrators. 

As a genuinely big fan of the app I‚Äôd just love to see some changes to make this app the hub for meditation. Keeping it exciting, challenging, and effective even for people who do it dailyI LOVE this app. I have a lot of trouble sleeping due to anxiety and calm has helped so much. I usually fall asleep within five or ten minutes of a sleep story starting. I also really like how you can keep track of your moods and get recommendations for meditations based on what your mood is. The only reason I gave four stars was because I really think there should be an option to make a playlist or a repeat option of what stories, sounds, etc that you want to listen to. It‚Äôs really annoying for me to have to restart a story or choose a new one because I haven‚Äôt fallen asleep yet. That really wakes me up and stresses me out. Overall this is an amazing app that is totally worth the subscription cost and I have recommended it to many people.Okay the title is definitely misleading because I just wanted you to look at this review. It is like a normal good review because I love calm and it helps me fall asleep fast. You should definitely get this because it helps a ton. I have one request. I want to be able to listen to multiple different stories but when I look up certain stories they are either different  than they should be or they aren‚Äôt in calm. It is annoying because even though calm is very relaxing it is not great. For example I was listening to a great story that was nice in the beginning but then the narrator started to tell the story in FRENCH!!!!!!!!! Most of all though  calm is good so you should get it.Calm has some of the greatest sleep stories with a huge range of topics and narrators‚Äô voices. Almost all the stories are 20-30 minutes. There is still no queue feature so if you wake up in the night, you have to go in and choose another story (very poor arrangement in this with Calm‚Äôs Still Awake? Page that blocks access to stories) and hope that looking for another story doesn‚Äôt wake you up more. Some poor design elements, like a virtually hidden Search by Narrator feature, which was hidden more during the last update. Still, it‚Äôs one of the better sleep apps. For the ANNUAL subscription price, though, I‚Äôd expect it to be perfect. 3.5 out of 5 stars.I absolutely love the content on this ap.  The only thing I think could be better is an option for making playlists or stacking of tracks.  One of my favorite features on the app is the sleep stories.  This issue is that I regularly wake up because the sleep story is over and have to fumble with my phone to turn on the next one, or go to a soundscape.  An option somewhere to string together content would solve this problem for me.  The best would be in there was also a fade in fade out option on the tracks so the beginnings and endings aren‚Äôt so abrupt.  Can you tell I struggle with sleep?! üòÇ Thanks for a great app, I do use it everyday ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èThis app, especially the sleep stories, has really helped me sleep. And improves my quality of life as a result.  My request would be to add new stories more often because they are so infrequent, it‚Äôs easy to just get sick of them and go off to some other method or app.

Here are some thoughts for better functionality for some of us.

Add a button to eliminate sleep stories we don‚Äôt want so as not to have to scroll through rows and rows of stories I don‚Äôt understand or like.  Often I fall asleep before a story is over and before I can add a heart, forgetting the next day to do it then.

Add a function to allow for continuous play of the masterclass sessions or meditation session.  Also add a shuffle feature for the stories.  It‚Äôs a hassle to constantly fumble with the device every few minutes to proceed through sessions.  Personally, I like to use the classes and meditations as sleep stories too.

Similarly, add a function to shuffle through the music.  Again, trying to sleep and constantly waking in the dark to play something else defeats the purpose.

Otherwise, thanks so much, love the app.I am new to this app and enjoy it so far. My free trial ends tomorrow and I plan to let the year subscription start. I have tried other apps before but really like this one. I love the calming voices and sounds. One request would be larger font and/or font that stands out more for low vision users. I don‚Äôt have trouble with sleep but started listening to the sleep story of the day which I really enjoy. However I fell asleep while listening. The next day I really wanted to know how the story ended and had a hard time figuring out how to find it. Should be an option to find recent activity. Maybe there is but I can‚Äôt see it without my readers... lol! Overall really wonderful app and seems like a lot of content!I have been using Calm for 2 years now. My 5 year old listens to a sleep story before bed, I usually use a soundscape, and my most beneficial meditations have all been guided by Calm. Keep up the great work!!

My wish list:  I wish it would ask you monthly what your goals are, so it could curate what it shows you based on that instead of just what you have used in the past. Sometimes the search is hard because I don‚Äôt know exactly what I am looking for, I just know what I am feeling now - if you search your current feeling something useful usually comes up. Other than that, Calm has been very helpful.I really enjoy the app in the ambience it starts and with headphones it really is calming. I use this mainly for sleep and I love listening to the stories. The reason why I‚Äôm not continuing my subscription is because the stories are short and I don‚Äôt fall asleep. I know that sounds bad and like (what can you do) but it would be nice if Calm had a queue option where you could put a few sleep stories in line to play. It was less... ‚Äúcalming‚Äù to not fall asleep and then have to struggle with the menu to return back and try to find another sleep story.  I like the quality of the stories and hope there is more fiction like ones in the future so maybe I‚Äôll revisit!I love most of the stories! The narrator's
have very SOOTHING AND MYSTICAL
VOICES!!  Some of the stories also have very soothing mystical background ‚Ä¶.(some musical and some sounds of nature) I would love for the volume to be elevated because they add to the soothing effects of the stories!! I was so IMPRESSED with Glacier Express that I am SERIOUSLY thinking about visiting The Swiss Alps!! I thought I would have liked A Very Sleepy Burns Night Dennis Lawson ‚Ä¶..has a very soothing voice but he recited the poetry using a VERY HEAVY SCOTTISH ACCENT with singsong tempo that I found RATHER ANNOYING!!
I also wish you could add more hour long stories when I am having a real hard time falling asleep! üí§ 
A reviewer complained about famous celebrities narrating the stories which really didn‚Äôt bother me though I prefer lesser known ones to narrate!! I was Exceptionally impressed that pop singer Shawn Mendes  could narrate a sleep story with such VERVE AND EMOTION
Matt  McConaghy did a decent read and Morgan Freeman is the KING üëë of spoken word!!
Overall I am  IMPRESSED with Calm and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!First of all I adore this app and use it every night.  This is the first time in my life I have been able to sleep without medication which is very impressive.

I do most of the sleep stories every night and they are very effective but some nights I could definitely use a longer story. Also a lot of the stories jump straight in where as I could use a brief meditation to get myself physically comfortable. ‚ÄúClose your eyes and settle in‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite long enough for me. One of the options I see would be to stack the stories with a guided meditation preprogrammed to follow with a sleep story.I use this almost exclusively for the sleep stories. I love the Lionwood stories. The developers should add a way to put the series of stories and the chapters of books in the same grouping. It‚Äôs not easy to tell by the title if Lionwood is in the story. Also, wheee is chapter 2 of Alice in Wonderland? I only see 1, 3&4.  And more chapters of The Little Princess please!!! 
I have used some of the other features:  series, music and meditation for self care and self improvement. 
The only reason I‚Äôm not giving five stars is for comments above about how to find sleep stories more easily.this app is awesome if ur looking for something to help u sleep or relax! my favorite part about the app is the stories and soundscapes! but theres one thing about the app that i dont like. for one they take a long time to add another new story to the app AND when they do the stories haven't (recently) even been stories. i really like the storie like the snow queen, the velveteen rabbit, and beauty and the beast. and also they came out with the little princess part one like forever ago and they keep putting out stories like australians
coral coast and twilight to moon like... those are documentaries! ik i just ranted but overall i rly love this app and its rly helped me!üòòI‚Äôve been using Calm for a few years and it has totally changed my life. The guided meditations are amazing. This review is less for the service and more for this actual app. 

- Once you complete a program, there‚Äôs no way to start it over in the app, you now have to manually manage the series and your place in it. I often restart a series and I have to ‚Äúheart‚Äù the last one I did in order to keep track OR I have to go through my history to try to find out which one I last did. 

- There‚Äôs no search. I have to remember which category a certain program I am looking for is in. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt be the only one that restarts programs but it just seems like it would be an easy fix for the service to indicate where I left off last better. 

With that being said, this app is worth every penny and I‚Äôm grateful to y‚Äôall for putting it together üñ§I think calm is a wonderful way to reduce my anxiety and help me sleep better. The one issue I‚Äôm having is that when I want a sleep story there is only two stories to listen to and I‚Äôm getting tired of listening to them over and over again. There should be more story‚Äôs and maybe consider the music to have 1 open. But overall it is an amazing app to help yourself CALM ( get it üòâ) down. It can get a 5 star app if you just add a few more story‚Äôs that are not locked, and some music or calming sounds I can listen to!I enjoy this app and it has helped me through a lot of overwhelming anxiety. Not too long ago I found my sister after she killed herself and the bedtime stories have been a big help to distract me enough to sleep. Again I really do enjoy the app however, the bulk of everything is locked and as a new college student I don‚Äôt have the extra money to pay for a subscription (moreso for the meditations my therapist tells me is good for me) but I never seem to get through the first story before I‚Äôm asleep dreaming of lavender fields. Keep up the good work. Thank youHonestly, it's an amazing app and I adore it but can't afford to go premium at the moment. When I did have it, the app did wonders for my mental help and I'd eagerly recommend it to everyone. The only thing I'd suggest to the developers is to perhaps allow people to buy a single story or meditation. I have 2 favorite stories that would put me right to sleep every night and would love to be able to just have those rather than paying monthly for every available thing.",0,CaylieHanTinySenshiLghtbrwnWmm0114Linzimrg13HangingpicturesLaurabeth46Chriscross987654321Merf0301jgvygjhgybJohnny5321WhitMoGoCoolpaperweightsHeat3042SnufflyfluffKdukkergua shaMiner DuedBeckszymaciekateüåπChelseyBakerwater drink preferredAylissaAlRoshy266,"Sleep, anxiety, & life saver all in one appSleep Stories are AMAZING!Love the app but need playlists for sleep storiesLove Calm - can we have more anthologies please?Great but one minor change...Wish I could buy some episodesAmazing but one suggestionGreat but complacentAmazing App Just One RequestCalm is the worst thing in the world!!!Great sleep stories but no queue featureLove the app, wish I could stack tracksThis works but need more functionsRelaxed and Happy with PurchaseWonderful, Organization needs workAlmost works for me!Calming!Fantastic app. A few things I would do differentlySleep stories are the best on this app!I LOVE THIS APP!The Calm service is great but the app really needs improvementsMaybe calm premium doesn‚Äôt have all of the good storiesThank youSingle purchases?",CalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalmCalm,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,24,0,3665,has_narrative,287

Defeating the purpose of the app! Sometimes I want to listen again and I‚Äôm not going to do your little therapy session first. Please make it easy to listen to a story again without a lot of navigation. A good app should not require more than three steps to find things but now it is hit or miss. They eliminated some buttons so I can‚Äôt find what I want. I can‚Äôt find a favorites button anymore. The changes you made are not an improvement. There are good things here to help sleep if you can find them but by the time you do you will be wide awake. // I finally found the Favorites. You need to separate the Daily Calm Favorites from the others. It‚Äôs too many to find the stories. Like I said this App has good content but it‚Äôs badly organized// I wish you would make a text menu because with the icons it requires so much scrolling. Overall the navigation is a hassle for what should be a relaxing app.II am a lifelong insomniac. I spend most nights staring at the ceiling for an hour or more before I fall asleep if I do at all. This app has helped so much in getting myself into ""sleep mode"" and calming down & stopping my brain from rewinding the day or cycling through the next day's schedule. I occasionally listen to music but I mostly stick to the readings. My only request is to get Matthew McConaughey to do more readings! I have tried listening to others and they just don't work. I'd say my biggest complaint is they are all reading as though they are reading to an audience that's awake and aware. They are either too loud (even on the lowest setting) or reading with too much inflection which excites one rather than lulling one to sleep. MM knew his audience and his reading is in a very soft tone, his voice is calming and relaxing and he also seems to lower his voice as the story goes on, barely above a whisper by the end. All in all his is the perfect presentation and the only one I can fall asleep to! So please keep this story in rotation and if you can convince him to do more, please do! Otherwise I am content listening to the same story night after night.I found this app because someone I know recommend I try it for the sleep stories. I‚Äôm
a very busy person and my mind tends to race and sometimes I just can‚Äôt turn it off when I‚Äôm trying to sleep or relax. I tried one of the free sleep stories and I sacked out pretty quickly. I also tried the free background soundtracks and music when I was trying to concentrate. All worth the price of free admission. But then I tried the mediation. I‚Äôd always thought of meditation as new age mumbo jumbo. But many of the smartest people I know all have stories about when they started doing it and how it changed their life. So on a uncharacteristically unbusy Saturday I decided to try the meditation course. And now I realize how simple and profound it all is. It‚Äôs essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person. It‚Äôs really life changing. This course starts slow and you can see real benefits after a week or so. I know have my own story about when I started meditation and when my life changed for the better.I really like your sleep story‚Äôs everyone I started I‚Äôve been at least getting to fall asleep faster but I know you can‚Äôt do much about this but I just can stand the guy who is in most of the story‚Äôs I want to read, his name is Alan sklar or something like that and some other boys I can‚Äôt remember the names of I just want to tell you so maybe you could make most of them girls because I think they have a more smooth voice witch in Science is proven to be better to listen to at night and it soothes people to listen to witch in most cases reacts to better sleep including me but in all I think you app is helping millions in ways you can‚Äôt imagine better sleep can help with better minds you could save lives if they have better minds they can think before they end there life sleep is extremely important all you need to do now Is get a good add that will intrigue people that need help and they won‚Äôt just turn the volume down on the adds they will listen. Please take this into consideration I‚Äôve already lost someone to choice of death you could save people from that. Yes it might seem impossible Just TRY.Whenever I use this app I usually use it only for breathing, mainly because that‚Äôs all I can because of premium. My mental health has been horrible these past days and this app could probably help, but it‚Äôs not free. My family might do the 7 day trial but sense my mental health is most likely going to get better I‚Äôm sure they would think it‚Äôs a waste but not everyone is lucky to have the money for these things. 
There could be family‚Äôs in need that don‚Äôt have the money for fancy memberships like this. Though I‚Äôm sure my family would get the subscription some people don‚Äôt have the money to do. 

What I‚Äôm saying is if you see this could you please look into some stuff that could be free because I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to take at least a couple of things off the premium even if it‚Äôs just 1 story or anything that could help. Even if you have to watch a ad every time. It would help a lot for people and it would even help me too.I saw advertisements with very satisfying videos.  One was a long cube being cut into nine thinner blocks.  The other was kind of like traveling through space in a glowing worm hole.  I am in the seven day free trial of the premium and can‚Äôt find those.  They were so satisfying to watch.  I want to watch them over and over.  I listened to a sleep story last night, it relaxed me but did not put me to sleep.  The guided meditations are nice.  The only way I will possibly pay for this is if you show me what I came for.  Also, hot tip... if you want to pay for a year, cancel the app and you get  a thirty percent off offer immediately. If you go into your iTunes subscriptions, there are several different prices for a one year subscription to premium.  Discount baby!I have anxiety, depression, and nerve pain (peripheral neuropathy). Plus lots of regular life stress with family, work.  Downloaded this app after trying out another one referred by a friend.  That didn‚Äôt work as well for me. 
Was drawn to Calm because of the soothing background options. Used sporadically at first, now I use it in the morning regularly, and at night if I can.  At night I like inner peace and self-care meditations. 
The sleep stories are the best. I have disturbed sleep and wake up around 3 or 4 am. Instead of staying up overthinking and in pain for hours like I used to do, I listen to the nightly sleep story. Now I fall back to sleep within minutes and don‚Äôt get to finish the whole story. Favorites so far have been Bob Ross and Sleeping Beauty read by Nick Viall from The Bachelor.It‚Äôs frustrating when apps claim to have a free version but then literally nothing is available for free. On this app, you literally get one story and one meditation unless you upgrade to the premium version which costs $70. Just list it as a subscription and not a free app. It would be so much more helpful if you could really check out the features of this app for more than 7 days without signing on for the subscription or being prompted to subscribe every time you touch anything. Sadly, this is an app I might really like and would consider paying for if it had a legitimate free version that I could try out for awhile without the false promise of a free version with no features and constant prompting/pressure to buy.I love the app. I really do. If you have trouble turning off the old brain at night, please try it. BUT to Calm: all the languages! I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a wonderful thing to increase your market. I totally get it. But can we have a setting to turn off being able to see the stories in languages that are not our native? It makes it sooo hard to go through the list. The worst is seeing a story being suggested or a new story (yay!) only to turn it on and it‚Äôs in another language (sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell). Also, a sort by new stories or alpha would be awesome. I could listen to Erik Braa or Alan Sklar read the alphabet....Thanks!
PS - I will say, though, that an occasional story in French, which I don‚Äôt speak, will put me right out.I love this Calm app each night. It has helped me sleep better and I rarely hear the end of any sleep story. The one thing that I don‚Äôt like is that it takes many tries to get the app to work. I touch it and it says ‚Äùtake a deep breath‚Äù. Then it disappears and goes back to my home screen. Very annoying. I counted 12 times that it did this before I could choose a sleep story. What is wrong? Why does it take so many tries to get it to work. I‚Äôve rebooted and turned it off then on. Still does it. Please let me know what to do. I paid $70 for it. I need it each night!Generally speaking I love the app and use it virtually everyday.

However, the last few updates are causing the app to not recognize my downloads. That is, the downloads section in settings says I have 62 meg downloaded but the actual downloads section in the main app where I select the item to listen to, in this case a sleep story, says I've not downloaded anything yet.

This is a real hassle because now I have to go and search to find the item I want to listen to every night instead of just going to the downloads section and clocking on the item and listening.

If I delete the app and reinstall the app the downloads are listed again without me actually redownloading anything. This tells me the app is getting messed up reach time an update is installed.

This is starting to get old. Renewal is coming up and I may just skip it and try another app. There are plenty out there. I like this app though so I'm hoping this gets fixed.Last Night I used Calm app‚Äôs ‚Äústory‚Äù feature for falling to sleep. First of all, I was easily relaxed by the voice of the reader. It was soothing without sounding ridiculously forced as are those of the many other apps I have tried. 
    I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd find a story relaxing, because in my other attempts, I have tried meditations which have sounded like hypnosis sessions, and nature sounds that awakened my alarm sensors over worrisome storms.
     For me, my first try was well worth the  apps cost. Since I found Calm useful, I may keep the app. $60 a year feels outrageous. However, it is, after all, pennies a day ....zzzzI used to enjoy this very expensive app but the new design makes it impossible to navigate. I can‚Äôt find the table of contents for the life of me. Nothing is labeled except with cryptic images. Instead of calming. It‚Äôs actually agitating and upsetting. Pushing what looks like a Home icon doesn‚Äôt bring you to a home page. All I want is to find the list of sleep story options or the list of background sounds to choose from or the timer to set but none of those can be found anymore. It seems like you‚Äôre given only on option. Unacceptable for the price we‚Äôre paying! FIX THIS APP NOW!!!I was hestitant to download this and a friend kept nagging me. I don‚Äôt like audio usually, I really enjoy my silence, my job is on the phone all day. But this app has changed my quality of sleep. I fall asleep faster with less racing thoughts and I wake up less on nights I listen to a sleep story. I also use the nature sounds sometimes and if I‚Äôm having a tough day working from home the nap sleep stories help me maximize my rest on lunch and are the perfect length to do so. I like that it has the option to track moods but I have a separate app for that with more thorough data.I‚Äôve enjoyed the Calm App. I always fall asleep before the story gets to the 1/2 way point and I barely remember what the story was even about. I‚Äôve listened to one story 4 times so I could hear it in it‚Äôs entirety. One small complaint, on occasion the app seems to glitch, rendering it useless. A story or music will appear to be playing, while there is total silence. I‚Äôve had to do a hard reboot of my phone to get it to play. Not sure why this has happened, nor do I know who to contact about this annoying problem.I‚Äôve loved Calm for years, but the latest update broke the app on my iPad. Now when I go to play a sleep story and close the lid on my iPad, within 10 seconds the story stops playing. If I leave the cover open, when the screen timeout goes to sleep, the story stops playing. I can tell you this frustration is the opposite of Calmness. Please fix it soon and I‚Äôll change my rating to 5 stars.

Update: They fixed the bug I reported to their support team.I waited to test a few sessions before reviewing. I don‚Äôt know how, but it works. Every single time I start listening and think, I will be so frustrated in 27 minu ..zzzzz. In short, I never make it to the end of the story or the meditation. I have melatonin, magnesium, trazodone, ativan, Tylenol PM, tryptophan, valerian tea... I‚Äôm sure I forget something. Nothing works like this app, to include the prescription trazodone (gives me a stuffy nose as a side effect so that‚Äôs that). I actually look forward to my night story. I wish they had some cooling meditation.  Buy it.When I first had Calm I did not expect it to work, because all of the apps that say that they can put you to sleep never worked, the other apps just had sound effects, and never really worked for me. Calm changed my amount of sleep time up a lot, even though I have the free version of Calm, I still always fall asleep to the same story. I recommend this app if you want to get better sleep, Calm is always my option if I can‚Äôt go to sleep, it reminds me of when I should go to sleep and wind down.My brain is too active to sleep most nights. The sleep stories capture my attention enough to allow me to go to sleep and if I wake up I play another. I‚Äôm the stories are perfect for capturing just enough of my attention.. My favorite is Calm Airways. When I first started listening I would have to play two or three or more stories to get to sleep and wished I could make a playlist. Now my mind hears a story and it‚Äôs a good trigger that it‚Äôs sleeptime and I usually only need one story I highly recommend.Good things: most all sleep stories, background scene sounds; music selections, variety of meditation methods 
Not so good: sleep story narrators with ‚Äúaffected‚Äù timbre, too fast or high pitched, not relaxing and grates on the nerves
Really bad: App doesn‚Äôt load properly! It takes several times trying for it to finally stay open!! Even when it appears to be open, it isn‚Äôt. It just times out over and over and won‚Äôt open. Takes forever to stay open properly. Maddening!!!I, first off, want to say that I‚Äôm 17 and I use this app almost every night. It works so well and puts me to sleep within 5 minutes of the story. But, my only complaint is that there is only 1 sleep story that‚Äôs free and listening about lavender every night gets kind of annoying. The premium subscription costs $70 per year and as a 17 year old, I don‚Äôt have enough money to pay for that myself and my parents don‚Äôt either. So, editors, please please add more free sleep stories. 

Sincerely,
Someone who probably has insomniaI love calm but would like for there to be an option to create a playlist. I like listening to the daily calm but then need to reopen my phone to set up a new meditation or sleep story or music. For me, having the ability to continue focusing on meditation without having to restart the app would be amazing. I am giving the app 3 stars so that my voice will be heard.  I am very happy with the app. But this improvement could set this app apart from other awesome apps such as aura.Great content, but it seems that if you don‚Äôt fully close their pages after a session (rate this session page, quote page, practice history page) it continues to draw down your battery. My phone gets physically warm and currently reports that the Calm app has used more than twice as much battery life as any other app on my phone. This is especially problematic if you use the app to fall asleep because then it is left in this high power draw state all night.Hi so I think you should get calm because you probably need it. Especially if you are weird. My favorite story is Michals Sleepy Farm. So you better download this app or I will come to your sleep farm. I will track you down so please get this app because I don‚Äôt want to come to your stinky house. I‚Äôm looking at you bob. Get this app! Thanks for reading this! You probably can‚Äôt. Cause your 7th grade teacher taught you nothing. Bye sweeties!

It‚Äôs as if they have beautifully sculpted the app with time. I really appreciate the choices given when I open Calm. Sometimes I need a moving meditation. Sometimes I need the wisdom Sometimes a little humor and sometimes only Tamara‚Äôs calming voice will do. I really appreciate the meditating sounds of soft rain or a washing machine or waves ebbing & flowing. But my very tough Working K9 will only calm when going through his annual vet visit with blood tests and shots and such to Baby Shhh and it works every time. So I guess if Calms me and my dog, I have to give it five stars. I love the breathing part. I use it almost daily. Not a fan of the music but the sleep stories are the best and I love that I can use the search bar and find one of my favorites I may be in the mood for such as a dream over Paris or the history of the Library at Oxford or the train stories. Also the narrators offer excellent choices and their are certain ones whom I just need to hear at hard times because their soft melodic gift of storytelling puts me right out. I really appreciate the variety. I have had the Calm app I believe since not long after it launched and as others have come and gone and Calm has had its own growing pains, it‚Äôs the one with which I remain. So, thanks Calm, from my Tough Dog and I both.I love the Calm app!  I stumbled upon a television commercial about it a few years ago and decided to give it a try.  I have had trouble falling asleep for years, and was honestly skeptical that an app would put me to sleep. Boy was I wrong!  I love the different options - sleep stories, music, meditation - each one is interesting, and while I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve managed to get to end of a story‚Ä¶well that‚Äôs the point.  I‚Äôm out within five minutes.  I‚Äôve read some reviews about the expense - here‚Äôs the thing - what is your sleep and a relaxed mindset worth to you?  Divide that annual cost by 365 and you‚Äôre paying a pittance for your health.  Check back around the holidays - the makers of Calm run specials sometimes that make it even more worthwhile.  I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt get the remainder of my annual fee (8 months left) refunded if I jumped on the lifetime subscription, but it was still worth the jump.  This is a must have app. 

*App makers - please put the sleep check-in back!  With the latest update it is gone, and it was something that really helped understanding factors that affect sleep.Calm has great stories, meditations and more. I love it and have the full version. I love Anna Acton, Eric Braa, and other soothing voices. Some of them, however, are just a bit...jarring. I know everyone has different tastes but I like to listen to voices directing me during meditation or towards sleep that don‚Äôt jump out at me. Please, Calm, add more voices like Eduardo Ballerini, Ramon Tikaram, Chik√© Okonkwo, May Charters and Jerome Flynn. Cillian Murphy is a great guest sleep story teller but please don‚Äôt just use celebrities because of name value. They don‚Äôt all make good storytellers/meditation guides. Some write the stories and I am grateful to those who come up with such wonderful sleep stories for adults. The ones that travel back in time, especially aboard old trains are outstanding! Just curate the voices a little better because some of us are too sensitive to the nuances of voice to listen to many of the meditations/stories. That‚Äôs kind of a waste. I end up listening to the same ones over and over. Please make the sleep stories at least 35 minutes, too. For those of us who need longer to drift away. 
Finally, since you are now making playlists, how about one that is just long train stories? Thanks so much!I‚Äôm a 19 y/o college student that suffers from an anxiety disorder. I feel anxious most of the time and when things to actually feel anxious about present themselves it can be absolutely debilitating for me physically and emotionally.
However calm allows me to find hope in my current predicaments, and is amazing at calming me down. I really enjoy the soundscapes and meditation but my favorite thing is definitely the sleep story‚Äôs.
Listening to a bedtime story made for little kids mostly is really strangely therapeutic. There are more adult options but give the kiddy one‚Äôs a try. I feel like I‚Äôm one of the last demographics that these sleep story‚Äôs would reach but they make me feel more secure and able to connect back to the security of childhood. 
But anyways I highly recommend this app, the subscription is a bit pricey but the quality isn‚Äôt matched anywhere else. Falling asleep, calming down, feeling secure, and gaining more confidence & hope have all been easy and peaceful to do with this app. I‚Äôve been falling asleep with my headphones on every night so I can listen to this without disturbing my roommate. But I feel like he would enjoy it too.
After just the first day of the free trial I‚Äôm hooked.I originally received a Calm membership for a year through Verizon and mostly knew it as a meditation app. I would probably give the meditation side of the app 3 stars. It has variety and guided options but if you are a meditator, it isn‚Äôt very helpful. The search feature also isn‚Äôt useful. I look for sound meditation with chimes at various times depending on how long I would like to meditate. And if I want a guided meditation, I want to be able to search by length, not topic. But all that being said, the sleep story side of this app is 5 stars. It has saved me from sleepless nights and eased me back to sleep when I‚Äôve woken in the night due to anxiety and illness. While I don‚Äôt use it every night, when I do, I am asleep within minutes. On nights when I‚Äôm having a hard time sleeping, one to two will ease me to sleep. There‚Äôs great variety from fiction to nonfiction, different types of narrators, and different journeys from walking through a bookstore to riding a train to taking a trip to space. I highly recommend the paid version for these sleep stories. I‚Äôve even enjoyed some of the children‚Äôs versions!I really am indebted to Calm for working in my life during this pandemic helping me w my emotions, sleep help and maybe keeping me at a level arresting the memory decline that seemed to be coming on w it‚Äôs debilitating force. (I don‚Äôt use words like fighting it because most things should not be put into adversarial roles) I wish I had more from our guide Jeff on how to meditate. I really relate to his presentation because he seems quintessentially California to me. I‚Äôve been meditating since I was 6 or so, brought up Vedantist Hindu, born Jewish and am now a ChristianI am an aging hippie. I meditate w my cat on my lap, I simply press my hands on her sides and she grounds me and then is the anchor; her occasionally purring. I love the pictures and the nature scenes. By the way I have been meditating every single day since November. If I might be of assistance, I‚Äôm not sure how maybe I could do a Spark or something. I wish there were Something way to dialog - I have been on the site. Maybe I could look more deeply into community of Calm. Thanks for saving my life as a process. This is one place I like to be every single day (sometimes night) contact me if you are interested in my story of success.Forget melatonin and L-theanine pills. This app is all you‚Äôll need to truly unwind, relax and fall peacefully asleep in no time. There is a variety of stories and meditations for pretty much every taste and style to put even the most persistent of insomniacs to sleep. With soothing, calming voices like Tamara Levitt‚Äôs and Eric Braa‚Äôs you are all but guaranteed to completely let go of your stressful thoughts, relax, and fall asleep in no time! While this app is great as is, I do have some suggestions that could improve it even further and bring it to the next, absolute highest level: 0) allow for bookmarking, or better yet, make the app remember where you left off in a particular story if you try a different story half way through, but then decide to go back or if you close the app and want to go back to that story you started 1) allow the user to preset the ‚Äòstop time‚Äô on longer meditations/stories. 2) allow sorting of all content by length of time 3) allow stitching of different clips (i.e. so users can piece together their own content from existing clips). Thank you and keep up the great work!Ever since I tried the free version of Daily Calm I knew it was exactly what I needed. I have used the premium subscription for a year now and Calm has more than met my expectations but exceeded them by far. Every morning I am in guided meditation with Tamara and then I do the gentle morning wake up stretches which have made a huge difference in the pain I used to have from my back issues. I do the chair stretches at work and the back care exercises when my lower back is hurting. I also listen to the sleep stories every night and fall asleep before half the story is over. These stories are so soothing and relaxing. And there are so many different stories and meditations to choose from. I can‚Äôt wait to delve into the talks given by experts regarding mindfulness and breaking bad habits, etc. I just wish I had more time to spend on Calm because I enjoy it so much. It has been worth every penny and i just renewed my subscription. Daily Calm is exactly what I need on a daily and nightly basis. I absolutely love it and look forward to another year with these wonderful people in this amazing app.Once, it was 3am and still dark out. Then, my power cut. I was absolutely terrified! So Al I did was curl up in a ball and hug my iPad as tight as a killer might choke you. I went on my iPad and scrolled through pages and pages of apps looking for messages so I could text my mother about the situation. Then, I came across one of my old apps called ‚ú®‚ÑÇùïíùïùùïû‚ú®. It‚Äôs been a while since I used this app. I think I stopped because I thought the format was crusty musty dusty wusty schmusty custy yusty gusty susty vusty busty lusty rusty tusty pusty fusty nusty kustywusty. But now, it looks better then ever! I love it! I am absolutely obsessed! Back to the story, I went into the app and started to use it, then my time on the app went from at least 3:00 to 4:00 in a heartbeat. It was so fast and I was and am obsessed! This really has helped me calm my mind and body. It helps me unwind all my thoughts for bed. This has changed my life! Thank you soooooo much for creating this app! Thank you for being so thoughtful about other people‚Äôs bodies and minds. Once again, thank you. Goodbye!I absolutely love this app. I‚Äôm a Christian and a senior in college. Previous meditation experiences have made me so uncomfortable because they ask me to recite something or meditate on something that goes against my religion. This app doesn‚Äôt do that! Also, I struggle with the epidemic in out world of Hurry Sickness (google it. It‚Äôs a thing.) I do too much, say yes to too much, worry myself, stress myself out, and don‚Äôt give myself quiet time. This app reminds me to care for my heart and brain. I meditate daily, every morning using the daily calm. I then do a timed meditation and spend time in prayer and meditating on my God. Starting my day like this makes me so prepared to deal with the hurry of life. I also do at least one other meditation throughout the day. I love the sleep meditations. I haven‚Äôt tried the stories yet, and I‚Äôve been using this app for several months. I think I‚Äôll focus too much on the voice and story to fall asleep. So! I just do a guided sleep meditation. I have no requests for how to fix this app. The price is reasonable and I‚Äôve had no issues with the app.  10/10 recommended!!!3 years and counting and I still use this app almost every day. From sleep stories and nature sounds or music, to meditations and mini mastermind series. It is everything I need for my mental health at my fingertips - whenever, wherever. When I‚Äôm upset, I can find something here that will help calm myself (pun intended lol) but it also helps me learn how to self sooth, instead of self medicate. Nothing wrong with medication if someone needs it, but I don‚Äôt believe I need it and want to learn how to manage my anxiety and not to let my emotions get the best of me. I listen to sleep story‚Äôs almost every night and pass out within minutes. I don‚Äôt think I know the middle or end to ANY sleep story, because I can‚Äôt make it that far lol. If you‚Äôre looking for a more holistic way of creating inner peace, this is it for me. I am a life coach as well and recommend it to al my clients, friends and family. I always say if I would get paid for how much I recommend Calm, I would have a really nice chunk of money.I love this app!  I was struggling with anxiety and restless nights as I am working full time and going to school full time and couldn‚Äôt seem to quiet my mind at bed time. The meditations, sleep stories, and ambient noise have all helped me tremendously.  I‚Äôm getting the best sleep since I can remember.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  As they are meant to do, the sleep stories often get me to sleep, but once the story ends, it is just silence.  The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can‚Äôt find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session. That way, if I‚Äôm already asleep or very close to it, there is no need to go back into the app to turn on ambient noise, risking the light from my phone putting back to an awaken state.  

Thank you, Calm!  Everything else about this app is fantastic and has truly benefitted me and my mental health.One day not to long ago I was struggling to get some sleep and so was my sister was too when I would try to sleep my sister kicked and rolled when she was trying to sleep and she also sometimes kicked me off the bed and then I had to sleep in another room and her snores were so loud I had to go sleep in the basement and I slept on the couch there was also a TV down there sometimes I would watch TV so I could sleep and now I‚Äôm happy to have Calm also my sister stoped kicking and snoringüòÇ. Thank you Calm.

My favorite sleep story is the New Nifty and the Halloween scare there‚Äôs something that happened to me there was a bat on my front door it was really scary though. When I get really angry I stop, calm down and breathe in and out. I do breathing exercises. I like the back-round noises and the sleep stories. My friends describe me as calm Calm is the best app I‚Äôve ever used. I do happy to have Calm.

But I am SO grateful for this service. I had awful insomnia for the longest time. I‚Äôve been using the Calm app for a month and I recommend to anyone who will listen. It just takes 10-30 mins of sleep stories and I‚Äôm out for the whole night. It‚Äôs been such a blessing. I don‚Äôt use the meditations or ambient noise, it bugs my husband, but I just go to bed 30+ mins before him and by the time he comes up to bed I‚Äôll be out cold.  I will happily recommend this app to any friends and family that struggle with falling asleep. I love the sleep stories. The price tag is well worth it and I use it almost every night.  I wish Matthew McConeghey would do more of them that were less distracting because his voice is soooo soothing but his sleep story is like distracting because of the content. I love the Jerome Flynn stories though, I listen to them frequently. I wish you would do more of the Alice in Wonderland series, it‚Äôs sooooo soothing. Thank you for such a great service!After a year of nothing but stress, I felt that I needed a way to take control back and give myself some peace of mind, calm and some sleep. I tried the free version for a few weeks and loved it, so I went ahead and purchased it, and haven't looked back. I usually do the daily meditation in the morning and one of the program meditations at night, followed by a sleep story. While I still feel that I am not sure I am any better at meditating, I do feel more at peace and calmer.

I do wish for 2 things for this app: 1, that they tell you or give you an idea of what to do with your mind's eye once you close your eyes. For me, it is worse than my thoughts. But my husband and I came up with 2 different ""views"" (i.e. a meadow near a brook with dandelions to put my thoughts on and ""blow"" them away during my next breath - the visual of seeing them float away helps put them to rest). Now that I can focus on that I can focus easier on the breath.

And the 2nd thing I wish this app offered was a dairy of some sort. At the end of each session, you ask how it was, but I want to also comment on how I was - was I distracted, or did I feel that I improved. Being able to see the progress helps the progress along. It also would be a good thing to look back over and see if certain lessons need to be re-explored.

But even without those, I think the app is great and have enjoyed using it.I got this app because American Express provided a year free, so I jumped on that opportunity. So far it‚Äôs been great to incorporate the Daily Calm into my morning. I work very early mornings (VIPKid teacher), so I actually do that after work at about 6:15 AM. During the day my daughter (3.5 years) likes the kids Sleepstories, which I was excited to find. I am also working on another degree so I listen to ambient sounds or focus music while I study. At night we read some physical books, do a shirt bible study, then I turn on a children‚Äôs Sleepstory from the calm app. After she falls asleep, which is pretty soon after the story begins, I put on my choice of Sleepstory. I‚Äôve been recalling loving the train stories. I had no idea I would enjoy train sounds so much, but come to think of it I do remember my European travels and enjoying the train being s more valid form or transportation than it is in the US. But I digress. This is a great app and you should try it.The variety of meditation options in Calm means you will never be lost for a session regardless of why you‚Äôre seeking out a calming meditative escape. Pause your busy day and busy mind with everything from simple, low guidance sessions, set for the time you want and have available, or take a guided course that assists you with addressing an area of concern, like anxiety, depression, or just building resilience and gratitude skills. Calm now has masterclasses (which I intend to try soon!), meditations geared towards kids, and even bedtime stories, for those of us whose busy minds need a calm voice to lull us to sleep still. The calming bedtime sessions have helped me on numerous evenings when I thought I was going to be up way past my bedtime with insomnia. Instead, I quietly listened to someone reading a story, with tranquil ambient sounds, and was asleep minutes later. Give Calm a try, you have nothing to lose! The paid content is definitely worth the subscription price!I‚Äôve always been the kind of person who struggles falling asleep. I didn‚Äôt think that the sleep stories or the sleep music would help me, but boy was I wrong. At first I did all the free stuff. And then one night after going out to the couch and tossing and turning until 3 a.m. I kind of said screw it and paid the money for a years subscription. It seems like a lot of money, but broken down over an entire year it‚Äôs totally worth it!! 

I can not go to bed with out this thing, believe me I‚Äôve tried! I sleep so restlessly without it. I don‚Äôt use it too much for the meditation, but I have and it‚Äôs wonderful. I mostly use it for sleep. I‚Äôve found that I have favorite narrators that I like and I get so excited when my favorite narrator adds a new sleep story. 

I‚Äôm not someone who spends money willy nilly, but this was a very smart purchase and when my year is up I will be resubscribing. Just trust me, it will be worth every penny!I suffer from anxiety ever since my first fish died, and I lost him. He was my favorite one of all of my fish, and now it‚Äôs kinda rough, he used to do little circles in the water whenever I entered the room after school. Calm helped me slow my thoughts down, and helped me get through it. It‚Äôs incredible how A little story, or music, or even just words, can help overcome what you are suffering through. Calm is A friend to me, always helping me get through stuff, and now, I still have anxiety, and am often anxious for one thing or another, but I am easily calmed down by calm. and am also very very very clumsy. So I burn myself or cut myself by accident. But calm helps. Giving relaxing words, music, or stories. I hope the makers of Calm and their workers should be very proud, helping people A crossed the world overcome fear, or anxiety, or depression, or guilt, and Etc. You guys are amazing. I wish one day, I can say thank you for everything, face to face. You guys are amazing!Iv been using this app for about a year now. Super helpful throughout pandemic!! Initially started using to help with sound at night to fall asleep. But now I love the sleep stories so much. The Exploring Ireland is played regularly in the evening and I now plan to go Ireland some day bc of the story. I use the  playlist during my yoga/stretching after a work out to calm down and relax and I‚Äôm obsessed!!  So highly recommend bc of the content! 5/5 stars! I gave it a 3 though over all bc it‚Äôs a very slow app. I‚Äôll have full service every and other app works great on my phone but the loading time with Calm App is so slow  compared to other apps on my phone..sometime I‚Äôll just end up turning it off bc it never loads no matter the WiFi or LTE I‚Äôm on... now idk if it‚Äôs my service or the app sometimes.  I‚Äôd give it 5 stars if the app was fast in loading time.I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this app. I‚Äôm a life long somewhat insomniac that cannot fall asleep unless I have something that ‚Äúoccupies‚Äù my brain, so I can turn off all the junk I worry about. These stories are highly entertaining, and very interesting, yet calming at the same time. They‚Äôre also educational! I‚Äôve learned many things from around the world that I didn‚Äôt know before. Most nights I‚Äôm out after 2-5 minutes, but some take longer. If I wake up during the night, I simply start a new story and I‚Äôm asleep again. I have my favorite narrators too. I find that male voices with accents other than American (with the exception of Erik Brah and Alan Sklar) really lull me to sleep. I need a deep voice lol. Females with British, Asian, Indian accents are great for me too. There‚Äôs also calming nature sounds and spa music. I‚Äôve been using the Calm app for 2 years now and it never disappoints! Now I don‚Äôt have to reach for the Xanax anymore!I have been a paid subscriber for years, and, until this year, I would have said that this app is perfect for insomnia: 

Celebrity voices coupled with the technique of measured cadence and gradually diminishing volume are features that make this sleep aide unique and more effective than any of the many others that I‚Äôve tried.

I only wish there were a timer on the nature noise that comes in when the sleep story is finished,  as it is the ABSENCE of noise that eventually wakes me up in the morning, like the opposite of an alarm. I use silence as my alarm on another app and it works splendidly, and is not nerve wracking, like an alarm would be.

However, after years of satisfaction, an noticeable issue has come to my attention: More and more of the sleep stories are of a religious nature. At first the sleep stories were fantastic: funny stories, fairie tales, travelogues, poetry, even some to BORE you to sleep, like someone reading the rules of cricket! LOL 

But, for some reason, writings are containing more and more religious content and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm in a class on Religions of the World, when I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep. This falls into the category of ‚Äúpersuasive rhetoric ‚Äú and my brain is busy analyzing my own opinion s on the theology or philosophy that is presented, keeping me from resting. 

Could we please just have stories that our brains will not be analyzing for truth?I struggle with anxiety and depression, plus the related insomnia. My doctors have all recommended meditation but I couldn‚Äôt ever figure out how to do it. The guidance on this app, however, finally made the connection for me. I‚Äôve learned how to quiet my mind without additional medication. Not saying all my problems are gone - just that I have a new tool to help me cope. 

And the sleep stories are the best! Anytime the brain won‚Äôt let me sleep, I turn a sleep story on. It engages my mind enough to distract it from the litany of worries, stresses, and reminders of middle school embarrassments. I love the wide variety of narrators and subject matter.

One other thing... when I began looking for a meditation app, I really wanted to avoid any that promoted specific spiritual or religious practices. I haven‚Äôt come across anything like that in Calm. I can fold these meditations into my own beliefs/traditions without feeling stressed that they‚Äôre in conflict with one another.I fall asleep within 10 minutes every time I play a sleep story! I have been using the Calm app for several years now and absolutely love it. It used to be really hard for me to fall asleep because my mind would constantly be thinking (unless I was extremely exhausted), and have the calm app to thank. There are so many sleep stories to choose from by several different narrators so you can find your favorites. They update with new stories regularly, which is awesome. They also have a calm kids section which helps our little ones to fall asleep before the story is over! We also enjoy the daily meditations. I can‚Äôt say enough good things and always recommend this app to everyone. It‚Äôs so relaxing. Thank you!! Keep being amazing!! Definitely worth the money too, especially the lifetime rate with the 60% discount!!‚Ä¢allow a que: when i fall asleep, it‚Äôd be nice to align a que to automatically go from a sleep meditation practice, to a sleep story, to music without having to exit my trance to open my phone and do it myself.
‚Ä¢add things to listen to during workouts: it would be awesome to have a breathing regimen to listen to with some upbeat simple background music. i would love to hear this calming voice guide me through breathing while i‚Äôm working out- maybe allow it to play over music we have playing in other apps if possible. simple upbeat ‚Äúelevator‚Äù music would even be great.

otherwise- this app grounds me, centers me, and makes me calm. i can actually appreciate the meditation programs, and don‚Äôt find them to be corny or tenuous. 100% worth the money for full access for a YEAR!! i love it, thank you creators for helping with my negative mindset. and i LOVE the voice, i hope you never change her!The Calm app is revolutionary. It combines a range of real human voices and storytelling techniques with cutting edge sonic therapy using music and incredibly immersive ambient soundscapes that truly shine when you pair them with good noise canceling headphones by Bose or similar brands. I was diagnosed with Level 1 bipolar disorder as an adult and needed very expensive medical care that fortunately was largely covered by my wonderful health care provider, Kaiser Permanente- who also provided me access to the Calm app. Since listening regularly to morning meditations by Tamara Levitt and her colleagues, along with outdoor exercise, a ketogenic diet, and limited medication, my mental clarity not only has returned to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but actually has become optimized to a state I never experienced before. It‚Äôs like that great Bradley Cooper movie, Limitless. Except it‚Äôs better because this is real.My wife and I have listened to CALM for well over 2 years. Cannot express how easy it is to fall asleep listening to this app. When she first started the app at night my thought was ‚ÄúYeah right‚Äù I‚Äôm going to listen to silly music and drift into dream land. After the first week I was sold. There are many Calm stories we have started off in listening in bed and sometimes takes several tries to stay awake to hear the end of it. Our recent story is with Keith Morrison that took 4 times to get to the end. The storyline is about Goldie Locks and how portage goes missing and a bed is slept in - this is a story where I wanted to laugh many times during his reading yet I didn‚Äôt want to wake up my wife. This is one of my favorite stories to date. He applies his investigation methods to the story as he does on Dateline - this is great!I downloaded this app a few weeks ago during a particularly stressful stretch at work, and I have done at least one meditation every day since.  After working my way through all of the free meditations (a huge variety based on your needs - anxiety, focus, self esteem, etc.), this had become a part of my daily routine, so I went for the subscription.  And WOW, it‚Äôs so much more than just meditation - the daily calm each morning, the sleep stories before bed (so cozy, and come on, who doesn‚Äôt want Matthew McConaughey to read you a bedtime story??), the guided stretches, the breathing...all of it is so well thought out and relaxing.  It helps so much with stress from life and work, and has really improved my overall quality of life.  Definitely recommend, especially for those with stressful jobs or anxiety looking to improve their wellbeing.I have been using this app a little ver two years, and I love it! I use it for nights when I can‚Äôt fall asleep. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt have good memories of story time at night , being read a story by mom or dad, and falling asleep while they were reading?!üíï
Also if I wake up to use the restroom, and can‚Äôt fall back to sleep I use it again!  Al l 
Stories have a time on them, and iPhone shuts off when story is over. I also use the music app to! More recently, I have tried the soundscapes. My favorite is the light rain at night. You can even hear a few crickets and night creatures, very relaxing.
I live in the city, and two doors down from me, they are building a home. I discovered that by put this soundscape on high volume, it blocks out the noises of the cat, and the hammering.   I just love this app!Wow! Just wow I have never written an app review but this app is amazing! If you like soothing things like candles and mood lighting you‚Äôll love this!  I‚Äôve had it for 6 days and I‚Äôve used it for 6 days straight! ( the app likes to make you feel good about this and hey I love it!) I am not the type that can typically stick to something for more than a day or two but this app is something that makes you want to come back for more! The sleep stories are amazing and made me have vivid expressive dreams (of fields with lavender because of the lavender story of course!) The music portion is perfect for trying to focus in the office! And the guided meditation for beginners, is something I know will have transformative power over my life! There is a reason Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk meditate, it‚Äôs very effective! Overall download this app and pay full price for it, ya worth every penny!!I am enjoying this app so much. It really helps me focus on the breath and not on things which cause anxiety and stress. I also love the sleep stories. Works so well that I have never heard the end of a story. I had rated it 4.5 because I was struggling with the cost and whether or not to pay for the full version. Since then I have decided that the benefits were worth the cost and paying the one time fee helped me not dwell on the cost every month. I have recommended it to many friends. 
   (I wrote this review a while ago and it still holds true. The only addition I would make is that to newcomers it may be a bit tricky to navigate the site and find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, but they continue to make improvements and the improvements have been helpful.)I had been feeling really stressed with school and one of my mom‚Äôs friend recommended this app. It was like magic. There is a monthly subscription fee, but you don‚Äôt have to subscribe to have the app. I haven‚Äôt subscribed and I still use the app. I personally love listening to the scenes in the background and if you go to the ‚Äúscenes‚Äù tab in the app, you can make it so the scene‚Äôs sound plays even if you aren‚Äôt in the app. The sounds are just so calming. You can also do a feelings check in which I try to do every morning. It has a bunch of emojis to choose from to relate to how you are feeling and you can write more about it. Once you do this, you can also see your history to see how you were feeling another day. I really enjoy this app and I highly recommend it.This app is just unbelievable. I am a mom of two, ages 16 & 6, and I am also a special ed teacher, and I use this app both at home snd with my students!! Both of my kids have sensory issues as well as OCD, ADHD, and severe anxiety. My daughter‚Äôs needs are more severe than my sons are, and over this past year, there were some nights where this app was the only thing that got my daughter to sleep. She particularly loves the Disney lullabies and the Matthew 
mcconaughey sleep story... can you blame her?! ü§£üôÉüòâ haha JK...  but seriously, they are so relaxing ... I even enjoy the sleep stories!!

I was fortunate enough to receive a subscription for free when Calm was doing the give away for teachers years ago; however, even if I hadn‚Äôt gotten it for free, I would pay for it in a heartbeat!! One of the best apps we own, even if we don‚Äôt always use it!!I have tried a few meditation and sleeping apps, and this is by far my favorite. There are many ways to meditate with this app, with different voices and messages, and I love that. 
There are also many sleep stories that I enjoy and listen to over and over and sometimes I can repeat every word, but that‚Äôs ok; I still seem to fall asleep before the end of the story. Even if I don‚Äôt, I know, there will be another one right behind it to help me fall into slumber.
Another great feature of this app are the soundscapes. My favorite is the crashing waves, and the gently falling rain. 
For any mood you are in, you can find a sound, story, or meditation to help you relax and destress. I highly recommend this app and thinking it‚Äôs worth every penny and I hope you agree.Hello, I‚Äôm Jessica mother of Amy (age 5) and Molly (age 3) now tonight my children decided they wanted to listen to Snow White but when we searched we didn‚Äôt see anything so we made a list of tales you should add! First off, Princess and The Frog, my children love this tale and before calm I read it to them almost every night. Second, Goldie Locks, I remember picking Amy up from Pre-K and her telling me all about this story, she was very happy when I bought the book and read it to her and wants it on calm too! Third, Hansel and Gretel, this sweet book made Molly drool about a candy house, so I knew it must be added to calm which hopefully will! Lastly, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, this Story I told Molly when she wasn‚Äôt even two, but I knew she liked it because as I read she giggled happily in her crib. Anyways hopefully you see this. Stay Safe Stay Home.
          -JessicaI signed up for Calm in late October 2020 during a particularly difficult bout with anxiety. The Breathing Exercises were what drew me initially, because yoga had taught me the importance of regulating my system through the breath. The exercises helped a lot. I quickly found that the Sleep Stories were another instant salve for me in times of need.

At this point I have done countless meditations and a few masterclasses. I have logged over a thousand hours of mindfulness. My daughter loves her nightly Sleep Stories just as much as I do. We daydream about who we‚Äôd like to hear narrate a story, or if we wrote a really relaxing story, would Anna Acton want to record it? :) I just renewed for another year because I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my experiences with Calm.I've had to medicate myself to get to sleep for a very long time. I tried this app and loved the stories. I decided to splurge on the premium features (I rarely spend money on apps) and see how it went. That was a year ago and I just renewed my subscription. I plan on making better use of the meditation portions this year. The sleep stories are wonderful though and I would happily pay for this app for just that! Lots of different story readers to choose from so you know you'll find a voice that relaxes you. I can now sleep without sleeping aids! It's wonderful! Thank you!!!

Edit : I would love a section to track my mood and basically use as a journal. It would be really interesting to see the correlation between days where I meditate and days I don't and how it affects my mood.I could never recommend this enough. I have adhd and anxiety. Falling asleep some nights seems impossible with all of my racing thoughts and restlessness, and I have used medicinal sleep aids, meditation, reading by nightlight, and every other solution available before I found calm. The sleep stories give me just enough stimulus that I can tune out my thoughts and lull myself to sleep. I would never have dreamed of a solution with such simple effectiveness as the calm app.  I have been using this app for 3 years, and have always listened to the same story, Blue Gold by Phoebe Smith. I can quote the first half word for word, but to this day I have never heard how the story ends. So rarely do I have to resort to medicine anymore. Thank you creators!!I started using the calm app in November 2022. It works very well depending on the reader you choose. I was never able to sleep because of my clustered thoughts that only come up every night. Calm helps me focus on the story and the reader‚Äôs voice. I wish I was able to get the calm app earlier and focus on a good nights rest. The reader‚Äôs voices are wonderful and calm, and the story is just as perfect. I would never be picky on a certain story. Instead, I would pick a random story and feel comfortable. In the morning, I love doing the breathing and meditation sessions. It prepares me right for the day, and helps me focus on work and being able to interact with other people and friends. Thank you calm for this wonderful experience you gave me! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI‚Äôve struggled with falling asleep for most of my life, where it sometimes takes hours. I do have bouts of not being able to sleep at all. I‚Äôm not sure how this will do during those more intense times, BUT the sleep stories have knocked me out twice now and that is a MIRACLE. I love the celebrity stories and how well they tell them. I‚Äôve always been one to hyper focus on my thoughts or get lost in my day dreams or an annoying sounds so I never thought a sleep story would work, but I realized when I started to fall asleep during a lecture (while I was in my bed) that if I try to focus on something kinda boring I might be able to pass out üòÇ helps my mind not hyper focus! I‚Äôm still in the 7 day free trial so it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try!!I bought this app during a deployment that was not very easy to get some shut eye. Being military, your body is pretty much trained to pass out whenever your not moving, however after the last few years of deploying, time zone changes, shift swaps, inconsiderate wall mates and the lack of understanding of ‚Äò24 hour quite hours‚Äô i needed something to help relax. This app, paired with Bose noise canceling headphones has saved my sanity. Throw on some bob ross or another wonderful sleep story, let the soothing sounds wash over you and drown out all the mindless chatter of the day. I also love that it plays a ‚Äòscene‚Äô afterwords, needing a constant ‚Äòsound‚Äô to over power the noises outside without being too much and this is perfect. Honestly I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this app, especially overseasFor the past 4-5 years I have had sleep insomnia, I‚Äôll lay down in bed early, turn everything off, relax and get comfortable, and still my wheels turn for hours. When I do fall asleep I never dream, and I wake up about every hour tossing and turning, even if initially falling asleep on my back. I tried this app by referral, and the first thing I listened to was ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù narrated by Matthew Mcconaughey. I‚Äôm still not exactly sure how, but I must‚Äôve fallen asleep shortly before the story was over. I had a dream that seemed to make up for the past few years because it went on forever. I slept for 7 hours, only waking up twice. Needless to say, I will be using this app regularly. I‚Äôm very grateful for everyone who puts effort into this app. As cheesy as it may sound, it‚Äôs changing my life.I love this app so, so, so much.  It has many sessions and options.  Meditations of varying subjects and lengths.  I love Tamara‚Äôs voice.  She‚Äôs so calm and intelligent in her meditation practices knowledge.  I have a lot of stress (husband of 27 years recently blind sided me with divorce papers), fighting depression and bucketfuls of anxiety.  Eating and sleeping issues.  There are mediations covering all those issues and more.  There are sleep story aids, soothing music.  There‚Äôs a calendar to keep track of your sessions.  I use this app everyday day.  Sometimes multiple sessions a day.  Sometimes I like a session so much I will listen to it more than once.  If you‚Äôre looking for soothing, easy, judgement free guided meditation, you can‚Äôt go wrong with Calm.  WELL worth the nominal fee.  I recommend this app to anyone and everyone.I signed up for CALM quite awhile ago.  There are many times I have not been able to go to sleep... my mind is racing with various lists of tasks, projects, paperwork and everyday life responsibilities that have to be tended to.  CALM is my drug free alternative. It is nights like tonight that it gives me the most for my money.  I have my next chemo treatment tomorrow.  There are times when I am okay and can sleep, but recently it hasn‚Äôt been that easy.   So I turn to the app and I am usually out in 15 minutes.  I have yet to make it thru a story.  

I was recently able to use the kids stories on two of my young god children.  I was babysitting one night and they just could not lay down.  I played one of the stories for them... they were not even a year old yet.  I timed it.  SEVEN MINUTES and they were down and out.   SEVEN MINUTES... what a blessing.

I simply love the app.  If you question the benefits of paying for premium membership just keep in mind the monthly fee wouldn‚Äôt even pay for  a month‚Äôs medication so I am just fine paying for
extra content each month.  Especially since I KNOW it works.

Thank  you,
Christina ObenshainThis app is great, and has a wide variety of music, stories and soundscapes for sleeping. I just wish there were a few things. 1. I wish there was a way to load multiple stories at once, like a playlist so they could just start one after the other. 2. I would love it if when you pulled up a story or at the end of a story they had maybe like 3 other story suggestions that were similar to what you had just picked. (Like if I pick ‚Äúdreams‚Äù read by Harry Styles, they would have 3 additional story suggestions that were similar). 
3. I love the stories with music in the background, I would enjoy having this option on more stories. 

Other then that, this is a great app with so many options.gratitude I express not until my  for this well developed app but also my appreciation for the spirit of the creators since that spirit is reflected in their work. Although there is no need for apps to meditate or relaxing, it is very impressive how much easier it is with the help of the sounds you created, the EXCELLENT narrator and meditation guide. Also, the other features such as music, story telling, etc. bring more joy and diversity to the tools of relaxing and being in spirit. This app makes a great impact because it guides you gently through the new experience of meditation if you are a beginner and if you are more experienced, it adds to the joy of relaxing and meditation with their creative, well thought of, and diverse mental ambience creator.I reached for this app when I was going through a period of feeling really run down and drained. Some other life events were happening and I needed some extra help to get through. The short and long meditations, daily meditations, and sleep stories made a huge difference. Luckily life has come back around, but even though I'm not in a slump I'm still enjoying the daily meditations that I do first thing in the morning and a sleep story at night. Sometimes if I have a break in the day I'll do a guided nap or a quick meditation- especially on a hard day. I love this app and use it almost every day. I highly recommend it to my friends and coworkers, especially if stressed or having trouble sleeping.As adults, we often forget how effective a bedtime story is to help us sleep. I guess that‚Äôs why our parents read them to us as kids to calm us down and get us to drift off to sleep. We perpetuate the practice with our own children and they will with theirs. It‚Äôs a magical formula that seems to work like a charm every time. This app has some of the best sleep stories for grownups and kids alike. The narrators are very skilled at reading softly and slowly and the stories often interjecting sleep suggestions get your mind prepared for sleep. One of my favorites is Harry Styles who‚Äôs soft droning voice has lulled me to sleep many a night. I highly recommend this app for everyone. I got it through my health insurance plan and it‚Äôs one of the best services they‚Äôve ever provided.I downloaded this app as I was going through issues with my treatment for depression.  I have never been good at the relaxation portion of yoga, but found I truly was needing to find away to help myself focus and care for myself.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly I fell asleep after doing a body scan & listening to a sleep story. 

I still am not practicing ideally, listening to meditations on walks, while driving, or while doing work, but I am moved by the lessons in the different areas and need these gems of insight.   This practice is getting me closer to catching up on things at work and getting me to that place where I can truly practice meditative moments.  
I look forward to continuing and improving upon my practice and finding some inward quiet and peace.I started listening as an experiment since I work shift work and swap from days to nights weekly. After the first session, my husband asked, ‚ÄúWill you play me a sleep story before bed?‚Äù! I was in absolute shock! Even when I stay awake past his routine bed time to swap my schedule, I have to play him a story and he is sound asleep within a few minutes (maybe even seconds). I have also noticed our four dogs are enjoying the relaxing voices and sounds. All four are soundly dreaming shortly after the beginning and have started to expect a story as well! They snuggle down in their specific spots and wait with anticipation! I am excited to have found something that finally helps with my insomnia due to shift work!I‚Äôm a 10 year old girl and I have major anxiety because in the year 2015 my parents got divorced and I was fine with that but now in 2019 a.k.a last year the day after Christmas I went to my dads house and had anxiety and could not sleep at all. But when I got this app it saved me and whenever I feel stressed I will listen to one of the videos they recommend for me and I feel like the anxiety that has taken over me has been defeated by this app calm. I definitely recommend this app it is a life saver if you have anxiety like I do. Also if you can‚Äôt fall asleep then you can listen to story‚Äôs if you are an adult or a kid and you can listen to nap time music. One time when I listened to the nap time music and I fell asleep on the couch for an hour.This app is so genius! So calming and I‚Äôm absolutely hooked! There are so many different aspects of the app. You have to scroll around and look through it ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs amazing! My goodness the sleep story blew me away (blew me straight to sleep). Her voice was as smooth as silk. It was something about snow and mountains lol‚Ä¶ not sure- I fell asleep! I‚Äôm a mindful, calm and self-aware individual. This is the best app for me. From the second it opens up, you‚Äôre engaged by the sounds and aesthetics. So many things to choose from! Wow! I‚Äôm so excited. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on my well-being and now, this app is a 100% must. Try it, it is 100% worth it. By the way‚Ä¶ I saw something in there for kids as well! Nooooo way!!!Tamara Levitt‚Äôs voice is so soothing, I have been listening to the daily calm for almost a year.  When my anxiety spikes, I take a time out and use one of the body scans or meditations.  This app has helped me with night terrors, anxiety attacks, depression, and PTSD for almost a year.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if I would have gotten through some of my traumatic hurdles without it.  The children‚Äôs bedtime stories helped soothe my two young grandchildren when they would stay with us, and my friend‚Äôs two small children who recently lost their father.  And let‚Äôs be honest...there‚Äôs nothing better than Matthew McConaughey reading you a bedtime story!  Thank you to the creators of this app.  I promote it and share it constantly.  Tamara is my personal rock. üíúüíúI have been wanting to meditate for a very long time, but never really knew where to start or how to do it. One night I was having an anxiety attack and decided to try and find a meditation app. Calm came up and I decided to look into it. The first thing I saw was the bedtime story ‚ÄúBlue Gold.‚Äù The reader had the most calming voice and the story took my mind back to a trip I had taken to France. I was asleep before the story was finished. In fact, I fall asleep before most of the stories are over and I stay asleep longer. There are so many different offerings, including the meditation I had been wanting. There is limited access to the free portion, so I decided to purchase the yearly subscription, and I am so happy I did. Really worth trying.When I have a long day I find it hard to unwind and fall asleep, no matter how tired I am and I usually have night terrors that wake me up throughout the night.  Sleep is hard for me.  Sometimes even the fear of night terrors keeps me from falling asleep.

But this app has helped me so much.  It‚Äôs not like reading a book, because when I read I can‚Äôt help but read fast to find out as much as I can about the story, and it‚Äôs easy for my mind to wander while I‚Äôm reading.  It‚Äôs also not unusual for me to lose myself in a book and accidentally stay up much too late.  

The stories in this app are engaging, but the narrators usually read slowly, with drawn out pauses between sentences, which help ease my mind and allow me to relax and let go of worry.  They keep me grounded and in the moment.  Instead of letting fear or anxiety take over and drive my thoughts, the narrator is in the driver‚Äôs seat, and they are so calming.  I have yet to finish a story because they put me to sleep.  I also sleep through the night almost every time I use this app.

A dependable, good night‚Äôs rest is priceless, so the yearly cost of this app is very much worth it in my book.I‚Äôve been on a streak since the pandemic hit. 1 meditation a day-sometimes I only have time for a 3 minute, and others I choose longer. I love the variety of classes to meet my emotional needs for each moment of my day. As a family, we complete a kid meditation and sleep story each night as part of our nightly routine. I have even started to incorporate some meditations from this app in my classes with my students! This app has completely changed my life! I also do gratitude tracking, mood tracking, and sleep tracking, and have seen way better sleep prioritizing, and reflection! I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough! (And I love that they partner with my health insurance company!) ‚ù§Ô∏èThis is going to sound extreme, but this app has changed my life. Not only have I been able to fall asleep without any stress, I actually feel lighter every day.  There are so many fun extras in this app as well! You can track how your feeling each day. You can write short gratitude lists, and even go for a deep thinking question.  I‚Äôve had insomnia all my life.  I put on a sleep story and I‚Äôm out without worry or stress.  I tell everyone I know to get the app and subscribe!  My mother and I often joke about how long we can make it through a story.  Run don‚Äôt walk. Get this app and subscribe.   I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Bravo calm and thank you.I‚Äôve been using Calm‚Äîsometimes for meditation but primarily for sleep‚Äîfor about 4 years now. The sleep stories are incredible and I listen to one almost every night. Highly, highly recommended. 

Not only has Calm helped me personally, but I‚Äôve also incorporated a lot of the skills into my job. I work as a public librarian and I have incorporated breathing exercises and mindfulness activities into my story times and elementary school class visits. Plus I‚Äôve done more in depth mindfulness story times for families‚Äîand I wouldn‚Äôt have had the confidence to jump in if I hadn‚Äôt become a regular meditator through this app. I truly rely on Calm to help me maintain my health and general well-being.I first read about Calm in NYT several years ago. I tried it and never stopped! I‚Äôm an ob-gyn physician and by definition sometimes my job requires me to be up all night‚Äî hence I really need to sleep on all the non-work nights. Calm cuts through my stress, anxiety, irregular sleep schedule and brings me to deep sleep. I usually fall asleep within 3-5 minutes. I rarely awaken. If I do I start another story with equal success. I use the ‚Äòscenes‚Äô background sounds as I wind down for sleep and they play again after the story. 

I sometimes use the nap stories as well. They are short and time my naps so that I don‚Äôt sleep too long. 

I highly recommend this app for anyone struggling with sleep.In a busy, chaotic, and extremely stressful world, this app has made it easy for me to find my center while I‚Äôm on the go and in the trenches.

It‚Äôs easy to let your personal well-being fall to the wayside when you‚Äôre trying to be an elite performer at work, mom of the year, supportive wife, and dedicated friend. 

This app has gifted me with the ability to take a moment to myself within the convenience of a busy schedule. If I don‚Äôt have time to meditate, at least I‚Äôll have time to take in a daily Jay or motivational story to clear my head. Calm meets me where I AM ‚Ä¶ and allows me the ability to keep reminding myself that it‚Äôs all going to be OK and I‚Äôve got this.Please helicopter me into the central office so I can shake each and every one of your hands.  This new phase of poetic bedtime-story mindfulness adventures is melting my heart, and my heart is muy cold sometimes.  I salute you, ye enchanting literary chosen people of wanderlust.  I want to marry you.  I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a man or a woman or an operating system from the future, I want to merge with you in a religious ceremony.  One time I set myself on fire by accident and I saw the face God.  That experience was better than this one by a lot, but I can confidently say that the two experiences live in the same neighborhood.  God bless you, good people of the digital realm of calmness .  May your days be filled with the the light of the joy of our faces as we resonate this golden sounding life bell.I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They say I have insomnia. I have problems with disassociation. The whole 9 yards. I‚Äôm also active duty army. They‚Äôve fed me medication after medication to help me get to sleep and also stay asleep. I‚Äôve been using this app for only a few days but I literally haven‚Äôt slept so good for as long as I can remember. It usually takes me around 4 hours to fall asleep. Now before sleep, I do a body scan meditation for 20 min then listen to a story. I‚Äôm out within an hour. Which sets me up to get 7-8 hours of sleep. My motivation and work ethics has returned. My anxiety and depression aren‚Äôt as noticeable. This app has opened my eyes to meditation. Something I laughed at throughout rehab and therapy.Hi I‚Äôm Ellie and I have a very hard time getting a good amount of sleep that‚Äôs why I use kids stories on calm. Every time I can‚Äôt go to sleep I listen to a story and fall asleep almost immediately. I also sometimes use the breath or the daily move. I use the breath because it helps me relax and calm down. I use that daily move cus it helps my move stretch and it makes me feel tired. My favorite part about calm is the kids stories. My favorite story is raggedy an stories. I like that story because it reminds me of just being calm you know. Anyway this is why I use calm and I think if you have any trouble with breathing falling to sleep exercise and much more. Calm has it. üòäWhen I first discovered Calm, I was a little shocked by the price of the premium subscription(thankfully my mom took care of that). The different soundscapes and music has really helped me out when I‚Äôm on a trip somewhere and need some background noise for wherever I‚Äôm staying. The different Sleep Stories are also quite entertaining and I fall asleep in minutes. My personal favorite Sleep Stories are: ‚ÄúThe Glacier Express‚Äù, ‚ÄúSouth Africa‚Äôs Blue Train‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory of The Transformers‚Äù( big science fiction fan btw), ‚ÄúAn Australian Adventure‚Äù (RIP Steve), and ‚ÄúSacred New Zealand‚Äù (quite fond of LEGO‚Äôs Bionicle franchise). BTW Tamara Levitt, if you‚Äôre reading this, I just want you to know that I really love your app!It has always been a battle to put my eight year old stepdaughter to sleep each night. We have tried reading books, putting a movie on, warm showers before bed, etc and still she would be constantly out of her room making every excuse in the book to not go to sleep. It would typically take between an hour to an hour and a half for her to actually fall asleep from the time we put her to bed. I decided to download calm and give it a try...I played the first story on there for kids and just like that, she was out within 7 minutes!!! Now we use it every night when it‚Äôs bedtime and she is out like a light. I no longer dread bedtime, and she enjoys the stories! Win win!!I am a Special Education Teacher and I use this app not only with my students in the classroom but at home to calm myself from a busy day. 
The first time I played a story for the students there was not a sound in the room. The spinning and repetitive noises stopped. They thoroughly enjoyed the calmness and security the story and peacefulness provided. I use it every day after PE class to bring the children back into a space of calmness and ready to learn. 
I also use this app at home when I‚Äôm feeling anxious. I do yoga and mediate to the 7 days of anxiety. It has helped my mental state so much the last month. 
Thank you for allowing teachers to use this app free of charge. I use it every day and I cannot thank you enough.Calm is a great app to us for a lot of thing but what I got calm for the most is my sleep I have trouble sleeping at night and when I got calm I was not so sure if I was going to like it but I loved it and it was amazing. I have one thing though if you could have a mute button for the cricket sounds because when I am trying to put my sleep story on I can‚Äôt without making a bunch of noise and waking people up in my room I share a room and that wakes her up. I also like calm because of all of the sections like they have like meditation, sleep, and music. The meditation helps when I am doing my work. The music helps when I am lying down. And the sleep helps me with sleep.I love this app and I cannot say that enough. I haven‚Äôt used many of the meditation aspects but the sleep stories alone are worth the subscription price. My anxiety loves to act up when I‚Äôm trying to fall asleep which means I can lay there awake for quite a while before I actually fall asleep. Listening to the sleep stories allows me to focus on something else and my anxiety fades away. A few of my favorites are ‚ÄúThe shipping forecast‚Äù, ‚Äúblue gold‚Äù, ‚Äúthe seventeenth princess‚Äù, and ‚Äústarlight symphony.‚Äù There‚Äôs at least one new sleep story every week so you can try new ones but also rely on your favorites. There are also ASMR options for those who enjoy that. Thank you, Calm, for helping me get more sleep!I have been using the Calm app for over 6 months now, and I don‚Äôt know how I lived without it!  Whenever I am feeling stressed, I can choose a meditation from their vast selection to alleviate the stress - and let‚Äôs be honest, we are living in a very stressful time.  I LOVE the sleep stories, which I use nightly to help me relax and ease into sleep.  There are so many to choose from and I have many favorites. It is such a luxury to have someone read me a story, using a calm, peaceful voice.  I am usually asleep before the story is finished, so I have to admit that I don‚Äôt know how most of them end!  I love this app so much that I signed up for a lifetime subscription - and it is worth every penny!  Try it - you won‚Äôt be disappointed.Calm is pretty good. The only thing that is bad is the fact that you have to pay for it. You can only get like, 2 meditations if you don‚Äôt pay $70. Other than that, very soothing and effective. I have fallen asleep  several times during one of these üòÇ. Would definitely do the women‚Äôs voice, because it is more calming and trancelike. Be careful with the sleep stories, because you will find yourself wanting to hear the end of the story, and it keeping you from sleeping. Would recommend to a friend tho, because it helps you manage your anger, relax, and learn to go with the flow. ALSO IF YOU READ THIS DOWNLOAD ROBLOX, SUCH A GOOD APP, IM ADDICTED, AND IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW APP WOULD RECOMMEND.I struggle at night to just lay there and go to sleep. I don‚Äôt want to think. So I distract myself with a game or social media only to get sucked in and end up staying up WAY later than I had wanted. Calm has really helped me with this. Instead, I‚Äôll click on the app and try one of the many options to help me sleep. Sometimes a sleep story does the trick, other times it doesn‚Äôt so I try something else. One night the sound of rain is soothing to me, and the next night it bugs me so I try a meditation instead. I love the variety available because of my ever changing moods. But it has been very helpful and I recommend it to everyone.This app is by far the best value I have found yet.  Nature sounds, sleep music, meditations, my favorite..sleep stories.  Fiction and non fiction.  Listen every night.  On a recent visit to visit grandchildren.  Very restless 3 year old even after bedtime reading and prayers she would lay awake talk and get up and just would not settle in peacefully for sleep.  I offered my Calm app and the kids section of sleep stories.  After family time of reading , etc, my daughter put on a kids sleep story and within 10 min granddaughter was sound asleep.  Used every night and every night she was out like a light. Granddaughter loves it my daughter is thrilled and loaded the premium app before I left.  Thank you Calm!Calm is the best app I have! It has helped me in many ways. The guidance it‚Äôs provided as I seek to make meditation part of my daily life has been invaluable. The voice of the facilitator is soothing and the messages are positive and realistic. I appreciate the structure and the length of the sessions. They are short enough to make including a session each day very easy. Calm also provides a truly helpful section on sleep. The adult bedtime stories have helped me get back to sleep quite a few times. They are so effective that I almost never hear the whole story as I‚Äôve gotten to sleep before it ends. I‚Äôve recommended this app to all my family and many friends. I use some element of Calm every day.I have to admit, I was very skeptical in the abilities of this app to assist me in falling asleep. I woke up around 1:00 am and as usual could not go back to sleep. I ended up turning to social media to pass the time until I fell asleep and came across an ad for this app. I figured ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. I downloaded the app, answered a few simple questions and started this story ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù read by Matthew McConaughey. I listened for a while with my skeptical thoughts still passing though my mind until I actually fell asleep! I woke up again around 3:00 am and immediately turned to Calm and was asleep within a few minutes! I am so impressed! This is something I look forward to utilizing every day! Thank you!I have depression with anxiety. This Calm app with Tamara has changed my daily attitude. I even purchased an aromatherapy machine to add to the dimensions I get from this miraculous app. I feel like a child being tucked in at night for a bedtime story which I look forward to to each evening. They put me to sleep every night without fail. My sleeping pills do not really work for me however, now with Calm I am unafraid of the tossing and turning of insomnia! Finally, a beautifully and thoughtfully designed app that takes me to a world of peace. If everyone were to use this app on earth it would be a very different place. Many thanks for the detailed healing approach that you place in this award winning app.First of all, the app is designed beautifully. I love all 3 sections (breath, meditation and sleep stories). I use them all. I use Breath occasionally when I need to focus, sometimes to start meditation, to calm down. I use the open ended mediation every morning. It's simply a bell that tolls at intervals so I can keep track of time without having to set a timer in advance. Seems like a small distinction but it's big for a meditation practice. And my boyfriend and I listen to a sleep story at night to help us fall asleep. 

The new release/design has a few issues I hope are addressed. Firstly, for some reason my beloved open-ended meditation isn't making the bell sound so it is silent. 

Please keep making new sleep stories!

Also I love the breathe section and its simplicity but I do believe it would be helpful to include a few more breath exercise options 

I highly recommend trying this app, which for free you can get a good taste of. I sprung for the year membership which in my opinion is expensive so I have high standards for what can be done and its possibilities for the future.It is amazing  when you feel sad it tells you story‚Äôs at night or when every time you want or calming sounds that are really calming sometimes I feel sad but when I try this app I feel happy there are other apps that I have and it works too but I like this one better they are called smiling mind headspace and a other one that is called calming too so try it so when you feel sad you feel happy again so go know and get this app so it makes you happy and me and ever one happy so go go go and be happy like you want to be because you can‚Äôt live sad you have to live happy so get happy so you can be happy and happier so you don‚Äôt sad  it works so go be happy like I amI have been using this app every day/night for years and I love it! I just have a few small recommendations for improvement on the app: 1: Once a story has been completed, it stops the app/nothing plays/all finished‚Ä¶ Can you please set up a way for users to select a story to play and then a soundscape to play immediately after that story is over without having to wake up and do it a few hours later? 2: Or can you set up a way for the story to be set on repeat so we can listen to it throughout the night and continue to sleep? Thanks!I cannot recommend this more! My favorite sleep story is ocean moon. I also listen to the sounds of acoustic guitar - desert something I can't remember. My kids and I listen to the children sleep stories, captain dream beard is their favorite and puts them right to sleep. I also listen to some of the ten minute clips, there's so many to choose from it's an incredible collection of ways to start the day. I often wake up in the middle of the night and the calm app is my go to EVERY time! The best app I have ever purchased. Thank you calm team!! More sleep stories narrated by Laura Dern - she has the most relaxing story telling voice!I got a Complementary 1 year subscription to Calm Premium through American Express, I haven‚Äôt heard of this app before but let me tell you the quality of this app is amazing! I listened to one Of the sleep stories last night about Jazz and within about 5 minutes I was sound asleep. Through these trying times stress can make it difficult to fall asleep so it‚Äôs great to have options like these so you don‚Äôt have to take medication to fall asleep. Thank you so much Calm for making such a wonderful app. I cant wait to listen to another sleep story tonight and try the other features of the app. And Thank You American Express for your Generosity.This has been a very stressful year for me and I have by the grace of God found my way back to recovery.  I was looking for something to add to my toolbox and meditation was something that was valuable to me in recovery before but I have struggled to get back into the practice.  Calm has been just what I needed.  This is my 3rd day of meditation with the app and last night I feel asleep without racing anxiety as I listened to the first bed time story.  I am a licensed professional counselor and would recommend this app to anyone, new to meditation, someone seasoned and has gotten out of practice or someone who is looking to add to their already existing practice.I was looking for some type of portable app to keep on my phone for occasional use outside of home. I came across Calm and decided to give it a try. The daily ten minute meditations are perfect! They are quiet, insightful, focus on breathing and ten minutes long. No reading books or guessing how long I have been trying to meditate on my own. The Sleep Stories are awesome!! I‚Äôm not a good sleeper - mind wide awake at bedtime. I chose stories in the 30 minute range and have yet to hear the end of one! When I do the meditation in bed just before the story I sleep deeper with less waking during the night. I‚Äôve just begun to explore the additional meditations. It‚Äôs a wonderful app - sooo glad I found it.Through the years I‚Äôve tried every sleep aid on the market, from over the counter pills to prescription. They all eventually lose their effectiveness with stronger and stronger doses needed, till they don‚Äôt work at all. The worst part is the grogginess the next day. CALM has been a God send. I use it every night. The stories are well crafted and eliminate thoughts racing around in my head. I get a good nights sleep and if I do wake up in the middle of the night, I just play another story. Taking a pill at that time always insured tiredness the next day whereas a CALM story just put me back to sleep. I truly love this app.I use Calm a lot and I enjoy it it is great for my things I can use it for gratitude by doing the gratitude checkin or I can listen to a sleep story when I need to sleep and I can also do meditations when I‚Äôm stressed out or upset and it helped me an all scenarios I think this is a great app for everybody even though some people might think that why would I need this well you never know if you will have trouble sleeping or being any of the scenarios so I definitely recommend it makes life a lot easier andBetter please download if you have trouble relaxing or sleeping or anything like thatReally enjoying the free trial. After a few days I decided I will be paying for the subscription when the 30 day trial is over. Anyone complaining about the price doesn't value peace of mind and sleep, a subscription of sleeping pills or anxiety medication would cost more than $15/month. I would like to know how often they add new stories. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and start another sleep story and 9/10 times I'm sleeping before it ends. Really enjoying this app, so glad I've found it. Nothing in life is free and this app provides a wonderful variety of mind calming processes. Worth it.I‚Äôve always been someone that has to have the room dark and absolutely no sounds whatsoever when I sleep. Now that my husband and I are getting older and especially these crazy stressful times with covid we decided to try Calm because we have so many friends using it and swearing by it. We have to use it every night and it‚Äôs is the most calming, soothing and relaxing experience I‚Äôve had and it puts us to sleep. Never did I think this would work in a million years but we have never heard the end to one story! I love all the other features/stories it has for anytime of the day. Best thing we have purchased in a long time.I love this app so much I spent the money to upgrade to premium. For me, money well spent. There is an exercise called Panic SOS that walks you through the breathing count when my anxiety is at a 10. I also really like the Sleep Stories, it‚Äôs like having a bedtime story read to you, as an adult but the topics are usually distracting and helpful to help ease you into sleep. I often don‚Äôt hear the end. It may sound silly, but when you can‚Äôt shut your brain off because you‚Äôre fraught with worry, etc‚Ä¶ this is a helpful tool to distract and eventually, drift off into sleep. So many other great features!My husband loves to use the calm app for its daily calm videos and I love to listen to the sound scapes for sleep. Both of these things help us relax after a long exhausting day. There is one thing I wish this app had though and that is poetry. I‚Äôd love to hear a celebrity or anyone really read poetry. It‚Äôs calming to listen to the rhythm of the words while also focusing on the message or story being told. They do have something called the poetry pharmacy which I listen too when stressed but the poems aren‚Äôt very long so it isn‚Äôt something I can listen to when trying to relax before bed.Normally I can‚Äôt sleep on an airplane, but one day the airline had a calm sleep story, about a train, I‚Äôm the seat-back entertainment. I listened to it and fell right to sleep. 
Now, I keep my tablet loaded with sleep stories and music here ever I travel, and I listen to  the meditations when I need a calm moment. 

I think what is missing is a way to create a playlist of the various media. I would like to start with a meditation, followed by a sleep story, and then a few hours of music without having to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and interact with the app. That‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me from using it every night.This app is incredible. Over the past year and a half, this app has helped me cultivate a mindfulness practice and has taught me many strategies for managing stress and anxiety. I love the meditations and the sleep stories. I use it daily!

One suggestion would be to add settings for Sleep Stories and Music (separately) to either ""play one"" or ""continue to next."" I prefer to play one sleep story at a time (currently the default), but I have been deterred from playing music to fall asleep because it automatically continues to the next track. That said, others might want one sleep story to roll into the next. I'd love to be able to choose!I never in my wildest dreams imagined myself using an App such as this! I‚Äôm a high strung, energetic individual. It takes a lot to slow me down. I must say, I achieved complete relaxation through this amazing App:) I‚Äôm still in my ‚ÄúTrial‚Äù and have every intention on purchasing the whole year! I especially love the detailed stories. I feel as if I‚Äôm really there, inside the story. I love the narrators accents, all of them:) I thought the price was a little steep until I examined all of the wonderful categories. There is definitely something for everyone, and it may surprise you to find interests in areas you never thought possible:)) Thank you developers!I have been a CALM app user off and on for a long time. I used it to meditate with a friend going through Cancer treatments and we‚Äôd sit together and do the Daily Meditations. I use it for times when I can‚Äôt sleep to listen to either the Nature Sound Scapes or Sleep Stories. I fall asleep in no time! And if I awaken in the night, I‚Äôll find another Sleep Story to get back to sleep. The music works too! I have been guilty of leaving it on all night! 

If you are a beginner meditation practitioner or just want to explore the things CALM has to offer, I would do the trial. You won‚Äôt regret it! 

Thanks CALM!I have had the calm app for a few years. Lately the quality of the new sleep stories has been terrific. I recommend trying the app. I love the new Red Rock Country story. I find the sleep stories have regulated my sleep after years of so-so sleeping. I am working on my meditation and so far the calm app has helped although I am struggling to find a meditation program that I can use long term. As a beginner in this area what Calm offers is helpful to build a consistent practice. Overall I am pleased with the content and I hope Calm continues to provide even better content.I have been taking Benadryl to sleep every night for years- otherwise I would lie awake with my mind reeling night after night. I asked my doctor for a prescription sleep aid- and she recommended this app. I am so glad she did! I am almost using no sleep aids anymore and the meditation is starting to help in every day life to be mindful. I have less anxiety now too. I love the sleep stories. Just enough interest to get my mind off the stress and listen to the story, but boring and calm enough to put me right to sleep. This is great. It‚Äôs expensive at $60, but averages out around $5/month? and the benefits are totally worth it to me.so i‚Äôm in love with harry styles... and honestly this is a BLESSING. i‚Äôve been having trouble sleeping because of my severe anxiety and depression disorder, and panic attacks. thoughts of cutting keep me awake. it‚Äôs very gets bad and i‚Äôm only a teenager. this is helping everything. i‚Äôve never fallen asleep so fast and he tells the perfect story that puts you to sleep in at least 10 minutes. and that‚Äôs never happened to me before! all you have to do is succumb to his voice and do whatever he tells you to. i swear, if you‚Äôre a styler, harrie, or directioner, you will LOVE this because it feels like he‚Äôs in the room. it‚Äôs amazing! totally recommend this!I‚Äôve been meditating for years and love the Calm app for guided sessions on the go (in waiting rooms, on the subway, even when stopped in traffic). But what really makes this app better than the rest is the Kids section in Sleep Stories. It‚Äôs become part of the kids‚Äô bedtime routine to choose a sleep story, cozy up in their beds, and fall asleep listening to gentle children‚Äôs stories like The Velveteen Rabbit or Rapunzel or The Nutcracker. (Sometimes, if I‚Äôm cuddling with one of the kids, I‚Äôll fall asleep myself and have to force myself out of the nest an hour later.) Such an easy way to get my kiddos to settle down and ready for sleep!Calm has been such a help for me, I really can‚Äôt say enough.  Especially since they have added the Master Classes, the Sleep Stories and they just continually strive to improve.  It‚Äôs not an app that sells you a ‚Äúgimmick‚Äù and takes your $$, then runs!  The quality is top-notch.  I have especially utilized the function which allows you to pull up your user history, so that I can return to meditations that I found most insightful.  I also find myself sharing with others about my positive experiences with the app and doing mini ‚Äúinfo mercials‚Äù for Calm sessions or features.  LOL- I may as well be on staff.  Thanks, CALM!I have anxiety, depression, and ptsd. Often I stay awake all night, then can‚Äôt get out of bed all day. It‚Äôs been crippling and ongoing for most of my life. I can honestly say it‚Äôs been over a decade since I‚Äôve had a healthy and sound night of sleep, and I‚Äôve never fallen asleep in less than an hour. Last night was my 5th night of Sleep Stories. I fell asleep deeply each night only minutes into each story. I woke up each morning naturally by 8am feeling refreshed. I never knew what this could feel like. I‚Äôm so impressed. No nightmares/night terrors, no tossing and turning, no constant waking up. I slept soundly. Thank you.This app. Calm is the BEST I have ever place on my iPhone. Two thumbs up üëçüèºüëçüèº!!! It helps me go to sleep knowing I have to wake up early for work, I love üíï this app.!!! I truly think all who reads this and like to be calm should truly get this app. Calm!üòä. I love üíó being calm in bed listening to calm nature or a calm story telling a specially if I have to go to work in the early morning üòù!! Thank you calm App. and keep sending new calmness.  This App. Make me complete and it helps me still when I need a deep sleep.  As long as there no glitches in this Calm App. I will be happy üòäI've been using this app for a few days now. Definitely considering putting my money into it! Everything about this is amazing! My body feels soft, relaxed, and almost renewed after each session I've taken so far! I'm a college student and I experience anxiety, stress, and loads of trouble with sleeping. This app is helping me with all of these, including staying focused and to just breathe and relax. The sleep stories are my favorite! I'll lay in bed and turn on a sleep story and close my eyes, next thing you know I'm becoming more relaxed and I always fall asleep soundly right after! Wonderful app for sure!I discovered this app being advertised on Facebook last year and loved it instantly! Since than I have told multiple people to use it and they are all benefiting from it. Recently, a friend told me she started listening to the story to help her fall asleep. She suffers from chronic migraine and always had difficulty falling asleep. No medication would help her. She would never be able to sleep before 2am and her maximum sleep would be only 4 hours. She started playing the story in the app. And soothing tone is helping her fall asleep instantly! By recommending Calm to her I was able to help change her life. Thank youThis app we mainly use for the sleep stories though I have used the meditations many times and love them. My two children and I all fall asleep to a sleep story each night. We love that new stories are added periodically. I do wish Keith Morrison would do more! He‚Äôs our favorite and he‚Äôs only got one story. We have to switch it up and listen to different stories or else they don‚Äôt put us to sleep so we often rotate through our favorites. We love his voice and the story! Please make more for him to narrate!! Thank you for an amazing and helpful app!This app is wonderful. If you are wondering if an app is really appropriate for meditation and releasing stress because it requires the use of your ‚Äúgadgets‚Äù that you may want to put down - I get where you are coming from!

...but think of an elegant app that you can open, and with a click or two get to a daily meditation or a wonderful sleep story and immediately set the phone or iPad down while listening... (and possibly streaming to your speakers). This is what the folks of Calm were thinking when they designed the app, and it works perfectly. 

So worth it! It is truly a joy to use.This app is a 5 star because whenever I cannot and I mean CANNOT sleep this always helps me no matter what !! Thank you for this app !!!!!!! Calm is my #1 favorite app ever !!!!!!!! It‚Äôs awesome and even the people voices meditate you too !!! Like 
(Sienna the sleepy sloth) and the Christmas one too !!!!! The voice meditates you always !!! I also love that actually famous people read stories too !!! Like if you like LeBron James he has a sleep story too !!! I love that this app has even meditation for naps !!! You can use this app for anything !!! Even car rides !!! If you consider getting this app , DO GET IT !!!I‚Äôve been using Calm for a few years.  I love the daily meditation as well as others.  I enjoy very much Lebron‚Äôs series.  My son and I listen to a kid‚Äôs story every night.  That is how he goes to sleep.  Recently, we started reading the Bio of the narrators before starting the story.  They are very interesting and my son loves reading them. Those night when I have trouble falling asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night, I use the app to help me getting relaxed and falling back to sleep.  Calm has a lot of stuff for different users.  I really enjoy the application.Hands down the best sleeping aid I‚Äôve ever used! I do not Fall a sleep without listening to a sleep story or a meditation. This app helps quickly bring you to sleep even after the hectic chaos of my day. I use to sit in bed ready and scrolling social media for an hour, wasting so much valuable sleep time. Now I just turn on a sleep story and am asleep before it needs! Worth the $60 annual purchased, for the cost of a pair of shoes a year, I‚Äôm able to sleep 8 hours a night without waking. Also, their customer service is great. I had a billing issue and they went above and beyond to assist.I‚Äôve been using this app for many years now and it‚Äôs helped me so much. I listen to them almost every night and when I have anxiety and put one on  I just think of the story and not my anxiety and it helps because tell me..would you rather sit in darkness and be panicked and upset and worried and tense and AWAKE or would you rather sit there awake and listen to a story to keep you calm and entertained. And mostly I will fall asleep when I can and I just love this app and recommend for anyone with troubles for sleeping. Someone like me! 
Thank you calm üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI use the kid sleep stories for my children every night and it helps them fall asleep nicely. If I wake and can‚Äôt get back to sleep a sleep nature sleep story helps my brain shut down and stop keeping me awake. Not all stories work but there‚Äôs enough variety to find what works. 

The meditations are guided and a nice way to recharge and there‚Äôs music options too. Mostly I use the sleep stories but it‚Äôs nice to know there are so many options so each person can use what they need to either calm their brain, get to sleep, or recharge.I‚Äôve been dealing and healing with PTSD and this app has helped me more than anyone can give it credit for. I personally pay for the premium plan because it‚Äôs worth it. When I feel the anxiety coming on I turn to this app for a quick fix. It takes time, but this has become my safe space. The sleep-time stories help more than I‚Äôd ever imagine. Definitely don‚Äôt knock something until you try it. Entirely grateful for the developers, you‚Äôre definitely part of my healing journey.  

Btw I‚Äôd love to read a story to one day!I find Calm to be a extremely awesome program that has so many different choices for a diverse group of people. It has helped me so much in my sleep problems after a massive stroke  suffered a year and half ago. I strongly recommend this to anyone e.g., kids and others who likes sweet, gentle stories, music that is softhearted and can assist anyone wanting to be more grounded. It has a plethora of choices from adult to kid stories including ‚Äúthe little mermaid‚Äù and even a wonderful
Story told by Matthew McConaughey. I am so excited about using the Calm app and hope others feel the same way. Thank you for your APP.I‚Äôve struggled with sleep since high school‚ÄîI‚Äôve always had racing thoughts and anxiety as I try to fall asleep. It can take hours, and when I wake up in the middle of the night, falling back asleep feels impossible. Calm totally changed that. I put on a sleep story and I‚Äôm out like a light; these days, I‚Äôm asleep within 5-10 minutes max. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I pop a story on and I fall right back asleep. I‚Äôve also used the download feature to help with falling asleep when traveling internationally, which is a flying and jet lag game-changer. Can‚Äôt recommend enough.Calm is awesome. As someone who has tried every drug on the planet to fall asleep (and usually without success), who would have thought that the quiets and most reliable way to fall asleep was a sleep story. I‚Äôve been using Calm for 2 years now and will likely be a subscriber until the day I die. 

Guided meditations are also great. I really like the Daily Calm. It means that every day there is something new to listen to and each day I learn new things thanks to the theme of the Daily Calm that day. I‚Äôm continually impressed.I am a small business owner that works with an overwhelming amount of clients each day for very long hours. I have found it extremely difficult to fall asleep at night or even nap during the day because of the inability to turn my brain off from work overload. I‚Äôve struggled to fall asleep quickly and deeply for 10 years. This app changed all of that!

The Calm app is some sort of magical trickery, the bedtime stories are hypnotic and soothing and work so well that I‚Äôve never even been able to get 1/4 of the way into one before completely Passing out. The narrators featured are so comforting in the delivery of each story. 

My 8 year old son has the same reaction to the children‚Äôs stories, he falls asleep instantly.

I‚Äôm so thankful for all the other features this app has that help with my anxiety during the day as well.

Download it and you won‚Äôt regret it! Plus, who doesn‚Äôt want to fall asleep to Matthew McConaughey whispering in your ear?After drinking way too much coffee all day, my body was tired but my mind was alive. I tossed and turned for hours. When I noticed the sun rising and the birds beginning to chirp, I had reached full desperation. I recalled a friend raving about Harry Styles‚Äô stories on Calm, so I downloaded it and chose the first free sleep story. Fully expecting to still be awake after the story was done, the next thing I knew I was waking up to the sound of an alarm! It works! I should have used this hours before I reached full desperation, and I‚Äôll probably pay for the premium version.I signed up for Calm about 4 months ago with a free trial positive that I would cancel at the end.  2 nights into using it I knew this app was worth every cent!

Calm has helped me (as someone working in the social work field) fall asleep when my mind is racing.  When my kids are having a hard time calming down we use it to stop and breathe.  I have used this app nearly every day since I downloaded it and have been so impressed by the new content being added (helloooooo Matthew McConaughey)! 

The kids beg for a sleep story every night and I cherish the cuddles while we listen ‚ô•Ô∏èOne of the most used apps on my phone is my Calm app. I meditate daily, always in the morning. I try to record my daily gratitude and in the Hemings I always sleep to soundscapes and occasionally a sleep story. I also use the app from time to time when I am stressed and need to slow down for a few minutes. If you‚Äôre reading this calm, it‚Äôd be great to have an option for a twenty minute daily meditation. You could simply add more quiet periods between the narration. Just a thought! Regardless, I love my calm app.I love Calm!  There‚Äôs so many options.  Each day you can listen to a new guided medication, select a specific mediation to fit your emotional needs for the day, or escape the stress of the day with a narrated story that will melt away the stress!  Every night with my kids (10 & 6) we do the daily meditation.  Then, they drift off to sleep listening to a narrated story.  They‚Äôve learned so much over the last two years about how to label, understand, and cope with their emotions.  Every child (and adult!) would benefit from daily practice!A friend told me about Calm. I was pretty skeptical about it, having tried sound machines and white noise machines that didn‚Äôt work. But this is different. I‚Äôve been using it for about 2 months now and I‚Äôve only finished one story. The voices completely calm me and lull me into a deep sleep. 
I find that there are certain narrators who have better voices than others. I‚Äôm sorry, John McEnroe reading the rules of tennis did nothing for me. But others are so beautifully calm and soothing that I barely get more than five minutes of the story. 
I will be recommending this to all my friends.This is a fantastic app and continually adds new content to and for sleep stories, meditations, classes , music and more. I especially like the daily Calm and the new Daily trip. I love Eric Braa and Jeff Warren‚Äôs soothing and clear voices. Some of the story tellers and speakers have voices that are difficult (for me) to hear or listen to, but these two men have wonderful voices, clear enunciation, and soothing speech. I love the constant updating of new material and variety. If a person is serious about calming their life, he or she will not regret purchasing this wonderful app.I was having a horrible time falling asleep about a year ago. I did not want to fall into the sleeping pill habit, so on a whim I downloaded the calm app. The very first night I fell asleep within minutes to one of the sleep stories. Thinking it was beginners luck or wishful thinking, I gave it a full week, and I fell asleep within minutes each night. I happily purchased the yearly subscription and I listen to it every single night. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what a single sleep story is about, AND THAT‚ÄôS THE POINT! I love this app and my youngest child listens to it every night as well. I LOVE THIS APP!!My mind wanders, as does most, when I try to get to sleep. I‚Äôm also a single mother of four grown kids and a high school teacher. Yoga breathing helps a lot when I try to sleep but sometimes i need more. The Calm app saves me. I love falling asleep to the stories. It takes my mind off life‚Äôs problems. Even when I‚Äôm up during the night I put it right on and it helps me stay calm and able to sleep once again. I‚Äôm so relieved going to bed knowing I‚Äôll hear a calming story. I‚Äôm better during the day as well. I‚Äôm not as agitated. I highly recommend those app.I have been dealing with some serious health issues, which in turn creates anxiety and sleeplessness. I am not sure what I would have done without the Calm app these last few weeks. I can finally sleep at night. I put my headphones on, listen to a bedtime story, and then the app plays calming background music and sounds for an hour. It‚Äôs also extremely helpful for getting me back to sleep once I have woken in the middle of the night. Anyone with anxiety knows that it‚Äôs really hard to fall back asleep. Calm calms the circus in my head. Worth every penny.Calm app helped keep my newborn happy and me relaxed through quarantine. Whether playing our baby, or myself, a sleep story, or using the soundscapes while working from home, the content is practical: volume doesn‚Äôt fluctuate like on some podcasts, stories are just stories and not ads, and everything is organized well. And it‚Äôs all relaxing. They also add new content often enough to keep it fresh. One request: please keep the train and non-fiction sleep stories coming! Thanks.In addition to implementing good sleep hygiene ( blackout shades, earplugs, going to sleep and getting up at consistent times, yoga, meditation), my Sleep Stories on my Calm App have saved me ! It was worth paying the yearly fee so I can listen to a variety of the sleep stories . They definitely put me to sleep by the end of the story. I bought a special Bluetooth one ear ear Dabs ear bud so I can fall asleep on my side and not hassle with old fashioned wires on my headphones. I was able to kick the Ambien nightly too! Worth a try for those who find the monkey brain keeping you upCalm offers an array of possibilities for transitioning to sleep. My favorite is the sleep story. Stories often take you somewhere else and bring it to life, sometimes back in time. You might learn about an ancient guitar maker or the woman who showed how metamorphosis worked in her botanical drawings - real people you can look up and feel you already know from the story. Some of the meditations are really helpful. I use a headband with earphones in it so I don‚Äôt disturb my husband. A lovely idea well executed.I love this app. The only thing that would improve is being able to have a que for listening.  So I could do a short meditation, that immediately goes into a sleep story, then  turn on one of the sound scapes.  If I‚Äôm on the edge of sleeping but the story ends and I realize it,  I will wake up to put another one on.  I use the sound scapes a lot to drown out noise that wakes me up, but that doesn‚Äôt work if I fall asleep listening to a sleep story.  So makers please add this feature.  I can‚Äôt be the only one that would like this.I absolutely am obsessed with this app. OBSESSED. I have ADHD, high anxiety and insomnia. The story ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù told by Matthew McConaughey is a GAME CHANGER! I was blown away and could of sworn he hypnotized me or something because I have never been able to ever fall asleep as fast and as sound as I did. I listen to it every single night. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what the story is really about or the end of it because I am OUT by at least half way through. I love this app so much and I am very pleased with the purchase and even the cost. Love love love love love!!!!!This app has been life changing. I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety all my life and I‚Äôve always known meditation could help me handle it. But, for me, meditation has always been this elusive practice that I could never get in to. Until now. This app has made developing a realistic meditation practice a reality. I do a 10-minute session every morning, and spend several one-minute chunks breathing throughout my day while watching one of the landscapes. Finally, I end my day with a sleep story, some music, or another meditation. It‚Äôs been simply awesome. Thanks so much for this app!!So far I‚Äôve done 114 sessions of the evening sleep process. Although I don‚Äôt do it exactly as prescribed where it says you should do your 10 minute meditation in a chair I actually do you mine lying in bed.  It‚Äôs the first thing I do before I go to sleep. After the 10 minute meditation I roll over on my side and listen to the sleep story. I rarely hear the entire sleep story before I‚Äôm fast asleep. Spoiler alert, I do take a sleeping pill and this practice seems to make it more effective. Looking forward to investigating more that the App has to offer.I love this app one of my friends recommend it to me and I have used it since. One I got it I payed and latter realized that, you can use it on so many divis√©s with out having to pay as long as it‚Äôs on the same Apple scout and I love that. 
It bin very helpful with my sleep.
I use the sleep story‚Äôs and the sounds the most.I don‚Äôt really get why people are like why do you have to pay blabla of course you have to pay and it‚Äôs for a good reason. 100%would recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI think that this app is very useful for students and everyone else of course who need some sort of stress relief coaching and also some meditation in their busy lives. I love the calming background music that we can custom to our own liking and the story time, interesting stories that are read and the most calming voices. Also the breathing exercises are very useful for relieving my anxiety, the instructor is easy to listen to and reassuring. I highly recommend this app to everyone especially students who need to de-stress!I‚Äôve had the premium membership for 2 years. Before Calm, I could not fall asleep easily, or go back to sleep. Calm and sleep stories changed all of that. I easily fall asleep before the end of any story. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I pick another story and I‚Äôm back asleep in less than 15 mins. Best news... it‚Äôs great if you are nervous about flying. Just listened to Tamara‚Äôs 21 days of calm, 5 sessions, during a flight today. It soothes my nerves and gave me the opportunity to really enjoy my flight. Thank you Calm!!!I love Calm-legit can't stop raving about it to everyone I know. Small suggestion though- diversify the narrators. This app is the best app I've ever used hands down. It would be very nice to listen to narrators that aren't all white women. A bit more inclusion and diversity would be great. How about a grandma or grandpa reading a sleep story? Or a woman from India, or Senegal, or even New Orleans? I love Calm regardless, but I know this may help others to feel more comfortable - as a lot of people are already new to meditative and calming practices alike.
Thanks for making this amazing appI love they added Harry Styles 
Love how you can do chew I in and then it shows you what story you can use to help with that so good u have the levels of stress and depression down I only have anxiety attacked once a week now instead of every night this has really help me with my depression and help me see a different side of life same with my stress
I like how you unlock the app with taking a deep breath to get in that feeling of that sort of mood 5/5 recommend
Ps: I have the premium or what ever and let me tell you soooooooo worth it
üòôI am a calm convert. I was hesitant about trying this app, particularly about taking the extra step of paying if I liked the free version, but I couldn‚Äôt help but love it. It took me a long while, but after listening to Stephen Fry lull me to sleep every night for a month with his free sleep story, I was hooked. I purchased the app. Just for the sleep stories, this app is worth it. The very fact that I get meditation, music, etc. in addition to my beloved sleep stories is icing on the cake. And I‚Äôm using it all!!! Do yourself a favor, try it, buy it.We have been using the calm app for just about a year now and it was worth every penny. It provides something for the whole family. My kids love listening to a sleep story for bed and when they do they are out in minutes. Calm has a very wide verity of things to use including meditation session which are one of my favorites. Another thing I love about the clam app is that there is many things you can personalize to get you the best results. I very much suggest this app to anybody who is looking for a meditation mindset.The Calm app has become my way of attending church. These meditations, sleep stores and soundscapes have helped me to connect to myself and curate discipline and self love. Tamara Levitt‚Äôs voice brings me to the present moment time after time. I am eternally grateful for the effort and care that goes into every aspect of Calm. Plus the Instagram story addition has allowed me to share some of my lessons and blessings with my network and I hope it has helped at least one person in turn. Thank you.Amazing isn't descriptive enough to give the Calm app it's rightful due. It has so many features on the paid version, I'm kicking myself for having waited to buy it. From meditation to sleep, stories to calming anxiety, this truly has it all. It has helped me in ways that I could not even have imagined in the beginning. The only changes I would make is being able to see my scenic screen in its entirety, not having my ""Daily Calm,"" and or new slew story taking up half the screen. Other than that, I love it!This app was ""prescribed"" to me with my discharge papers after a long g hospital stay and it has been with me for the last 6 months. It has many meditation options to choose from and her voice is very reassuring. I particularly enjoy the sleep stories. I know a sleep story is good when I have to listen to it several times before getting the end. To me it means the story is doing its job - helping me fall asleep. It has never crashed and it doesn't take much storage. It's a must have during chaotic times.I absolutely love this app!  I originally didn‚Äôt pay for the upgrade and listened to the same sleep story every night for about 2 months. Then I realized how much the Calm app was helping me sleep. Now I don‚Äôt go to bed without it!!  I love being an adult who falls asleep to someone reading to me!!  It‚Äôs fantastic!!!  The only thing I wish it had was a thing (a star or check mark) telling me I‚Äôve listened to a story already. Otherwise, I have absolutely nothing bad to say. I can‚Äôt remember sleep so good before the app. Thank you Calm!!I loooove this app but I‚Äôm begging for a feature.
Pleeeeease add the function to create a personalized playlist. It will help prevent me from seeing what time it is on my phone when I need to start a new story or some music or meditations. 
On my worst insomnia nights, nothing is more anxiety inducing that a sleep story coming to an end. 
I‚Äôd love to create a lineup of stories and meditations to get me through without having to scroll, look at bright light, and accidentally see the time. 
XoxoxoI cannot express how much this app means to me. I start off my mornings with a meditation and end it with a sleep story (my insomnia has improved dramatically). I consider myself a beginner and hope to always consider myself a beginner in my practice of meditation. The difference meditation has made in my life is extraordinary. I feel it and those around me see it. I know there are other apps and some I‚Äôve utilized now and again, but Calm will always be THE one I will utilize infinitely.We love the calm app! It has helped us to transition our 2 1/2 year old from our bed into her big girl bed. She loves picking her music or story and has learned how to control her breathing by using the app. I‚Äôve even been able to use it during the day for rest time or to get her refocused after a meltdown. She has learned which app it is and often asks to ‚Äúplay a song‚Äù to which I gladly concede! A big shout out to an app that makes my life with a toddler a bit calmer!!Use Calm daily. Sleep stories help me sleep and soundscapes are great for concentration for work or relaxation.  

Create Sleep Stories Playlist please, please, please! This way you can listen to multiple stories in a row without having to manually select it. Restarting the story every time I wake up so the story doesn‚Äôt end really is disrupting. 

For very light sleepers that wake up at any change in sound, continuous play of sleep stories would be helpful.I am subscribed because i just really wanted to try the other ones and it works so good there is so much other stuff then just sleep‚Ä¶. During the day i do some breathing exercises and listen to the music of there and when im having a hard time trying to sleep i just pick a story put it under my pillow and im asleep in 2 min‚Ä¶. When you play the music you can't put a sleep timer and set for however long you want. I usually put mine for 3 hoursI‚Äôve wanted to subscribe for a long time and recently found a subscription discount.  So glad that I finally joined.  The app layout is simply elegant  and well designed.  Easy to explore the many features  and content of the app and find what might interest you next.  Graphics are fantastic.  I think the sleep time stories are probably great, but I really don‚Äôt know since I‚Äôve fallen asleep fast, and that is the point to the story.This was an amazing story in which is really helping me fall asleep. I really like the way that she told the story of raggedy Ann. You were amazing and I hope to see more of your stories. By the way, are you an author, or are you just really good at telling stories? I think you really calmed me down and put the calm in this calm app. You made it more than just an app, and more like a journey through a place I have never been before. üôÇ also, do you tell stories a lot? Thank you for telling me this amazing story, and goodnight!!üí§üåôI rarely ever write a review in anything. I‚Äôve opened my calm app everyday since I activated my account on 2/17. Sometimes I just leave it in the Home Screen and listen to that scene, other times I listen to a meditation or a soundscape. My 4 year old loves the bedtime stories. Though she‚Äôs upset there‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúBingo and Bluey‚Äù story since that‚Äôs her favorite show. Long story short, I love this app and it‚Äôs content. I‚Äôll be giving memberships to calm as gifts to people over the year. Well done!I am new to Calm and am loving it. My son is a very active child and has difficulty unwinding and falling asleep. We tried the kids sleep stories and the first time he didn‚Äôt fall asleep before the story ended but was very relaxed and then we did a soundscapes and that did the trick. After that night, he asks for a sleep story and has fallen asleep before they finished several days in a row now. We are loving the app and can‚Äôt wait to explore more features.I have been using this app since early spring. It's a wonderful practice. It helps to turn off the mental chatter that goes on, at the very least, it makes you aware of it. This way, you don't miss your life! I've been using the Daily Calm, but have tried some of the others.  I have enjoyed all that I have listened to. The price is very reasonable. Oh yes, the sleep stories are great, my favorites are the John Muir notes about the national parks. The truth is that I have rarely heard the whole story. I fall asleep! Calm is habit forming, a good habit!I love the Harry Styles Dream with me sleepcast. His voice is warm and calming. His story is relaxing and feels like he‚Äôs there for you and with you in a happy and soothing place. Like you‚Äôre strolling peacefully on the shore under the stars holding his hand.  The mention of the stars always being above you is a meditative place you can always go to. The waves on the shore keep you asleep. I have yet to hear the inbetween part since I always fall asleep. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs wonderful.This app bookends my day with quiet time and a meditation in the morning and a meditation or sleep story as I drift to sleep. I‚Äôve tried other meditation apps, but Calm provides the perfect blend of music, meditation and sleep stories. It‚Äôs worth every penny and more!

For years, I‚Äôve had difficulty sleeping and thanks to the Calm essential oil spray and a nighttime meditation, more often than not I am able to get a restful night of sleep.  If I do wake up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep, I just put on a sleep story and it keeps my mind from spinning.

The number and variety of meditation topics and durations give me just the messages I need no matter what situation I‚Äôm involved.

If you are new to meditation and mindfulness or have been practicing for years, I think you will find benefit from this amazing app. I can truly say my life is enriched by Calm.I have 12 grandchildren and they love spending the night at Grandma‚Äôs house.  One of the things they like the most is listening to Mr. Calm !  Even the most wound up child finds the story irresistible and none of them have ever heard the end.  Now that I‚Äôm retired, insomnia isn‚Äôt much of a problem for me, but on those rare occasions that I just can‚Äôt sleep, I prefer Mr. Calm to the adult sleep stories if I really need to get to sleep, right now.   His calm, humorous voice is perfect.This app has changed my life for the better. I am calmer, happier, more peaceful than I ever have been. I have enjoyed every meditation I've done--but don‚Äôt miss the ‚ÄúHow to Meditate‚Äù series! 

I also really like the ""Breathe"" meditation. Though it is modifiable, I use it as is to take a moment here and there to still myself, re-center myself, and/or de-stress. It's amazing. 

I also love their sleep sounds and sleep stories. I listen to a sleep story as I go to bed, and, if I wake, I play Thunderstorms, my favorite. On occasion, I just play the sounds to settle down and focus into something. 

Last year I upgraded to the lifetime membership. It was a relief to do so, because I can‚Äôt imagine being without my Calm app. It‚Äôs the best money I ever spent‚Äîand it was on sale! Do yourself a favor and get the full, paid version of Calm; you won‚Äôt regret it.A great and much needed app!  I started using just before the pandemic and it was extremely helpful in getting me through it, and it‚Äôs continuing to help me now. There is something there for just about everyone‚Äôs needs. I just wish the sleep stories had a setting/timer ‚Äúto auto repeat‚Äù just in case I had not yet dozed off to sleep. I have to fully wake up to start the story all over again.  But again a great app!Tamara has the perfect voice for the sleep stories and meditations. I have not been disappointed with her work and I‚Äôve been on Calm for about 2 years now!! 
There are many stars in the cast, of course. Mathew McConnaghy comes immediately to mind. Love that guys voice.
I listen to a sleep story every night. It puts me in a wonderful state of relaxation that allows me to forget about the days troubles and drift off. Most nights I don‚Äôt hear the end of the story!!Every day, no matter how hectic, I make the time for a daily calm or a daily trip. Very different approaches that both have allowed me to maintain this daily practice for over four years. Through these difficult times, Calm has been a lifesaver. And when sleep eludes me, a sleep story almost always does the trick. I truly love this app and have purchased a lifetime subscription so I know I will always have it to help me on this journey called life.I *very* rarely think it‚Äôs worth my time to write a review but I had to make an exception here. The interface is beautiful, the soundscapes are enchanting. The A-list content (e.g., kids sleep stories such as Trolls story narrated by Anna Kendrick; journey to the stars by LeVar Burton, soundscapes from Dune movie, guided narration by LeBron James, etc) were a welcome surprise. This has helped both me and my kids to calm down and sleep better at night, and I can‚Äôt wait to check out the meditation and breathing practices.I went from closing the pop up for a good year to trying the ap. I wish I had done it sooner. I am a chef/owner of restaurant in the time of Covid. Sleep and mindfulness went away in March of 2020. In the two short weeks that I have been using Calm I have slept for more than 6 hours each night, and woke feeling rested.

Initially I got it because I had trouble sleeping and wanted to try their sleep stories. little did I know that I will find a whole new world in mindfulness meditation. I‚Äôve been meditating for 4 months now and find such joy, peace and even learning how seek gratitude. I LOOOVEEEE the Camilla Cabello collaboration; another sign this app was just something that I needed to incorporate in my self-development journey. The only thing I‚Äôm a little bummed about is the Calm Body- they only have like 8 options (lower back, morning stretch, etc). Other than that, I‚Äôm happy with this app/investment!",0,Lady_jewelz,Great self-help/personal investment,Calm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,110,has_collab,1

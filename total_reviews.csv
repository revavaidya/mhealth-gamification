After coming across Impulse, I figured I would give it a go. I have just completed the 30-day brain workout plan and feel real improvement now: it becomes easier for me to concentrate on the particular task and my working memory seems to be better as well. Not sure whether the same may be fully related to the use of this app, but I don’t care as long as I see results. I have bought the lifetime plan and consider this as a huge investment in my mental health.
Planning to start a new workout but not sure whether to go for 30 or for 10 days. It would be great to see some recommendations after finishing the 30-day plan.
Also, I enjoy solving brain-teasers a lot. Just a small suggestion here - would be really interesting to see how other players answered to brain-teasers.
The only thing I wish this app have is more training areas, like creativity, brain speed, etc. Also would appreciate more games and exercises (still, worth to mention that the developer adds new content regularly).
So, it’s a legit app and thank you for creating it.",5,False,kalsarikannen,The best brain training app ever!,Impulse - Brain Training

If I wanted to see that all that… I’d go watch porn on a platform made for porn. Not an app that’s rated ages 4+ with no way to report such ads. Obviously it’s not straight up porn but it’s so implied that it looks like you’re watching porn. Fortunately I found a loophole to skip all ads.

I've spent many weeks reading about brain training & cognitive performance over the past year, and specifically about boosting memory, attention, and retention.

Let me tell you, this app is what was missing from my daily life. I couldn't always train my brain when at work or university; that always ended in mental burnout. However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind. 

The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment. 

I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability. I wish the premium version was free so that I'd make full use of this app.

The app only wants to know how long you were on the machine and at what intensity you feel you worked.

ORIGINAL:
The newest version of the app took away the one thing I was actually using it for, tracking distances of my various workouts. 

Now when you record a workout all you are entering is the time. There is no field to enter distance. So all the entries I had for the entire year, leading up to when it silently updated on my phone are now lost. 

Additionally, when you do enter the time of your workout, it defaults the Calories calculation (which is ALWAYS much lower than what the specific machine calculated) but no longer gives you a way to override the calculation. Previously you could override it with what was displayed on the machine. 

Also there is no way to see summaries of previous months/year to date/... beyond the current month (August as of this review). 

Because of this change the only thing I will prob end up using the app for is to display my ID card to get in the door.

It pops up prompting you to interact for a bit and making you think it’s going to tell you some useful information but then it tries to make you pay before you can access it. There shouldn’t be as much push for people to pay. It’s irritating especially for people who can’t afford more payments like myself. I would much rather there be a pop up when you open the app asking if you want to pay for premium rather than being tricked into thinking I’m going to be getting something useful for free. Also I am a strong believer that all the info on this app should be taught to girls in school or be free public access but google is not a reliable source and this app has loads to offer but for a price. It’s already bad enough that women don’t get taught anything about their own bodies and it’s a “luxury” to access this information.",I used to love this app way more,Kylie12366

Well I was on my period a day or two longer so I figured it would probably change my ovulation date. Well my trip was set to be at least about 2 to 3 weeks away and I kept checking the app to make sure and to see if my ovulation date was going to change well it didn’t change it stay the same and make sure that I refresh my app just in case and it stayed the same. Now the day I get to my destinations for my trip is my ovulation day that was on the app that’s what we were depending on. Three days later I go on the app to mark the fact that we made love and the ovulation date changed to the day before I arrived on my trip. Immediately I was upset because it seems as though we may have missed the ovulation day due to the fact that the app didn’t update until after my ovulation date that was set originally. So I deleted the app because of that. It’s very upsetting when you’re trying to get pregnant and your ovulation date just seems to change along with your fertile days changes I just think that that is something that they need to look into I no longer want to use this app.,It’s nice but...,Naughty nixon

I also enjoy the option of tracking and recording my period symptoms. Years ago Flo was very educational and would offer quick articles or chats related to the symptoms you’d log so that if you wanted to know more about how to combat those symptoms or what causes them you could find out. Now it seems as if the only way to do anything beyond tracking the dates of your period and logging symptoms you have to subscribe to the premium membership. This would be fine if the app didn’t have articles (“You logged bloating, this simple tip may help”) that told you after the first slide “Unlock Premium to continue reading.” Like others have mentioned even the “chat” with the AI misleads you into thinking you will get information by having you answer questions for two minutes before telling you to unlock premium for this “benefit.” 

Aside from needing premium to do basically anything on the app I wish there was an option to check off that you skipped a period or two by skipping your placebo week of birth control pills. For a few months I used my birth control to skip my period all together but there was mo way to notate that on the app so Flo to this day thinks I had an irregular cycle where I was “late” for 94 days 🤦🏻‍♀️",Good For Keeping Track of Period Dates Only,LithiumBarbie

Doing this would make it a little more fun along with being able to choose the color of the circles or bubbles. Also, it would be cool if people could make their own articles for everyone to read but make a separate column you can click on, incase viewers don't want to read other people's. And lastly, the articles usually talk about tampons. Not everyone wears them including me. It would be great if you could tell everyone how they work and if it hurts.

Not only can you track your period with Flo, you can also access a community page to share stories, take surveys, and read articles. The period tracker itself is very accurate for me and is usually always on point. The period tracker also gives you the details on your ovulation cycle and such, which gives me a sense of security and preparedness. While I don’t use this feature of the app, there is also a pregnancy mode which can track your pregnancy’s phases and tell you about said phases. I’ve come to love the app and it quite honestly bests all of the other period tracker apps I’ve tried.

I don’t want to be confused. I don’t want to be sold. Even the idea of an ongoing subscription instead of a single-time purchase feels like a low-key way to continually ratchet the price & pull more money from me. Apparently I have to pay an even bigger price for my female health. When states are working to ban things like the pink tax, this feels like bad form. 

I’d even be willing to pay a single purchase price *IF* Flo promised that classic, simplified interface… even if I hate the idea on principal. I understand the need to support the developers.

I went to my first ultrasound toward the end of what I thought was my 8th week of pregnancy, and the OB estimated that I was really almost a week ahead of what Flo predicted (based on my last period and average cycle length). I tried to change how far along I really was on the app, but it wouldn’t let me! There’s an option to change how far I was, but it would let me select an option that was ahead of the app prediction.

AND I could only track certain symptoms at certain times of the month, which is just plain stupid. So I came back to this free app because I like the design and the tracking features because I have random symptoms all month that I will never remember and need to reference at appts. 

That said, the ideas behind that other app are great. I would love to have insights about each of the phases and the opportunity to sign my husband up for emails that help him understand my cycle as it happens, too. I would even pay for that. (Not a lot, lol don’t gouge me.)

My main reason for keeping it was because I could remove most mentions of pregnancy that are found in most period tracking apps. For those of us who aren’t looking to get pregnant, can’t get pregnant, or have difficulty looking at pregnancy related content - this update was NOT IT. Now I have to scroll through a long list of verbiage and track pregnancy tests, ovulation tests, contraceptives - regardless of if they apply to me. The other version allowed you to customize your experience so you’re not wasting time scrolling through options that don’t apply for you. Btw, the horizontal symptom scrolling with icons was way better UX/UI than having all the symptoms written out in a cluttered block. Don’t know how this passed accessibility testing! 

 At this point, I will probably have to remove myself from Flo. I am honestly unable to look at the pregnancy tracking features every day and I don’t even have the option to hide or skip. This feature change does not keep non-pregnant people in mind.

It allows you to go through add previous periods so it can give you an accurate cycle length/prediction, however no options to add previous pregnancies which I think would prove very helpful to the app being able to predict future periods/pregnancies.

As a concept overall, I love the app, but in practice, there are some major downfalls…
One large issue is the exclusive premium content. Almost NONE of the content is free, not even the most basic articles. I understand that the app needs to profit, but it leaves many users curious about topics they can’t even read about.
My other issue with the app is the forums. New posts are rarely added, leaving the feature unusable after going through topics. Though, the bigger issue with the forums is the lack of admins and experts addressing responses. Having a poll concerning medical issues and allowing just anyone to respond has led to many top comments that are totally misleading.  I honestly find this dangerous and neglectful. Women already have a lack of sexual education, allowing posts to perpetuate harmful and misleading ideas only hurts them more. I can’t even count the number of posts I’ve seen discussing risky forms of “birth control” and comments scaring young girls with the idea that sex should be painful. Without admins and experts actually going though comments, posts are becoming conservative echo chambers that are not fact based.",Not an educational tool,Stopmakingmerewritemyreview

CONS: The rest of the app. Constant nagging to upgrade to premium every single time you open the app, and then several times within the app in the form of extra tabs or banners. “Secret Chats” are more bloat than function. There’s everything from shortform smut to sensitive anecdotes. Why is this in a tracking tool? It should be separated into its own forum app. After watching some of the educational content, I believe more can be learned from a Google search. Then there’s privacy issues. The app tracks way more than necessary. I urge people to check out tracking apps like Drip that store data locally and don’t collect identifiable data. The existence of such apps proves accurate tracking can be done without a laundry list of linked data tracking requests. In their privacy policy, Flo promised to not sell to third parties, but will comply with law enforcement. It’s up to the user to interpret their level of comfort with policies and laws that could change in an instant, and reminder that online trails are never truly private.

I feel more confident in my body knowing I am not alone in some struggles. I wish there was no premium because I feel like learning about my body should be free. But I get that without money Flo could not survive so what if Flo gave premium content to everyone and added a feature where you could get a custom period or pregnancy box once a month. It would take some time to get right but I know for sure I would buy it. Women would have to take quizzes on how many products they use in a cycle and what products they prefer and all that. They should also include some type of food maybe fuzzy socks and a book! All things you can personalize. Of course this box would not be cheap but it would be worth it!!

68,Flo Period Pregnancy Tracker,2023-03-27 00:31:40,,False,2,"Flo tries too hard to integrate swiping and tapping into their information sharing as if it was Instagram with pop ups constantly. It’s annoying to be constantly tapping through “conversations” that talk about hypotheticals.  Don’t engage with the conversation articles if you are a natural health worrier. 

The app isn't the smartest. Example being it routinely asks me questions at an inappropriate time such as “did you know you can log pregnancy and change the mode of your app to pregnancy” after I just logged a negative pregnancy test. Lol.

At the end of the day the app is preprogrammed with one set of expectations on what your cycles, fertility and expectations of how sex should look like to include promoting a specific brand of prenatals without any context as to if they are safe or not and for whom (paid promo?), promoting fertility clinics (which is also a rabbit hole of unhealthy physical and mental things) and promoting how to master your orgasm (unhealthy neurological changes).  So if you don't subscribe to that particular approach this app is not for you and in fact it will be hard to ignore that while it keeps reminding you via constant pop ups and the need to “ask you questions” every single time you log something.",This is NOT a healthy App,dmontero21

I understand that Flo requires funding to exist, but I was incredibly disappointed by just how limited the free membership is. Without payment, it is just another cycle-calendar app. The reason I’m writing this review now is because my period is late and a little chat box just popped up that claimed it was going to go over the possible causes. When I clicked into it, the first screen was a list of things like pregnancy, stress, diet etc (stuff I could simply find online), and when I clicked next, expecting some sort on insight tailored to my input, it just said the next bit is for premium subscribers only. I couldn’t believe it. So far, I’ve found the app is basically pointless unless you’re willing to pay.",Great if you’re able to pay for premium,Nattt22222

The options presented vary widely from item to item, with little apparent logic. The best solution I have is to try to find items that use 1g as a serving size and then list the number of grams for that day’s serving as the number of servings for that entry. Since I’m using a food scale, that works for me. Seems a better solution would be to allow users to edit any food item to select from a full complement of serving sizes (or to just directly enter the desired serving size using the keyboard).

If you go for a run for example, it will sync the workout from fitbit and give you the calories for that, and then also add in your steps from the run and give you more calories which I don’t think is accurate.

My weight was 296lbs and my kidney function was dropping. My particular kidney condition is an autoimmune disease, so there are some medications that help, but there’s very little that can be done to directly control it. He highly recommended that I lose weight because that would ease the burden on my kidneys at least and it would help potentially extend their function. Over two years later, I religiously use MyFitnessPal to track ALL my food, down to the last crumb and ounce. About 5 months ago, my weight loss had plateaued, so I started watching my net carbs in addition to my calories. I have my maximum net carbs set to 60 rather than a keto diet level due to my other health issues and I started losing weight again. I am thrilled to say that thanks to MyFitnessPal and a lot of determination on my part and help from my family, I’ve lost 109lbs and increased my kidney function by about 10%!

The calorie intake is much less than what I should be eating because I’m breastfeeding but it turns negative when I include the snacks because it goes over the calorie goal. Not to mention that exercise is limited postpartum. 
I’m not asking for my fitness pal to keep track of my breastfeeding or anything like that (there are many other apps for that) but it would be nice if there was a note you could add or status change that one could add that encourages mamas who are recovering from labor. Not put us down for not being able to keep up with our diets and exercise habits pre-child. 
A little encouragement, especially around the 5th and 6th week postpartum would be beneficial since that is around the time when most moms can actually begin to work out and do light exercises.

I created my account and went to enter my first meal, which includes 12g of sugar free Metamucil. I weigh all my food to make this easier. After scanning the barcode and pulling up the item, I see that I am unable to enter portion by gram. This is odd as the food label lists grams in a serving, so I check other Metamucil items in the database to see if that option is present. It is not. So I enter the tsp equivalent. Apparently “2 tsp(s)” is 30 calories, while “2 tsp” is 40... ok well 30 is the correct amount, however the app then shows incorrect carbs and fiber. To enter a generic banana by weight, I had to set serving size to 1 g and then enter 137.4 servings. As a developer that has also done a fair amount of quality assurance testing, if a simple method for entering portion by weight is available in this app, then I can confidently say the user interface in anything but intuitive. If the feature doesn’t exist, then it is hard to take this app seriously. A food scale allows an app like this to be much more accurate. I will stick to the app I’m already using, where I enter almost every item by weight, and the results match the label. Metamucil is not an obscure item.

I don’t use any of MFP’s features except for the calorie tracking ones. I do use the “recipe” feature a lot as it lets me portion out big batches appropriately. For example, earlier today I knew to portion a beef stew I made into 11 servings so they’d be at 538 calories each. How would you get that kind of insight without carefully tracking he ingredients of a recipe? You wouldn’t.

My one complaint is that I’ve had the recipe app crash MULTIPLE times while I’m in the middle of cooking. Obviously this is a pain because I can’t just remember the itemized list of ingredients in painstakingly measured grams. My workaround is to save every few additions so I don’t lose too much if it crashes. And it shouldn’t be crashing, I’m using MFP on an iPhone 12 Pro.

Some examples: it repeatedly asks me to allow Apple Heath access even though it’s already got it (and is already using the data it gets from there). It reads my weight and then writes it back to Apple Health resulting in duplicate data points. I couldn’t get it to integrate reliably with UnderArmor’s (pretty terrible) other apps.

It’s very hard to ignore some of the numbers that will pop out at you if you are diligent and truthful with yourself. It helps to motivate you in a different direction.

The app will read and write the *same* data from Apple Health, screwing up your weight in both apps. I always update my weight in Apple health but when you look at the data in the app it shows the source of the data and after every entry in Apple, there is an  identical entry written by MFP. Sometimes this is a day after another entry and this especially screws up my data. Doesn’t seem there is an easy way to fix and has increasingly become a frustrating problem. 
The good features are the ability to see your data at a glance under the progress tab that is easy to get to and shows progress in weight, steps, and other body measurements.

I've been a MyFitnessPal member for years and do appreciate the detail, massive database, and ability to input your own recipes you get for free.

This is useless when you have to do it 4 times a day or more at different times, and you can't look back at sugar levels as part of your diary (linked to your diet). Do the manufacturers just assume that people interested in fitness and diabetics are mutually exclusive populations? 

We need either a setting to add our readings with a timestamp, similar to foods, that then can be read as part of the diary; or integration with the most popular glucometer apps.

Ever since it was sold by underarmour to a private company is has gone downhill. The app is now so inundated with ads you can barely log anything without annoying pop ups plastering your screen and slowing down your logging process.

Not only can an individual not scan in something, but worse still, there will be far fewer things scanned for users to find already there. This will be the thing that eventually kills this app. Not today, probably not tomorrow. But after a while it will just stop being the vast database it was as new food items come out, and no one who paid for premium has scanned them.

First of all, I want to say I've been using this app on and off for about 7 years now. When I first started using it, the app projected weight loss no matter the calories. At the time I liked this, but looking back I realize how bad that can be and how it could cultivate eating disorders. It makes me unbelievably happy that they have changed it to not publishing food diaries, not posting it on feeds, and giving you a warning that you're not eating enough calories to sustain your body, and that it won't project weight loss for under the necessary calories needed for functioning.

This was my husband’s thinking when we scanned an ice cream brand at Sprouts. The rating was poor. It said it had high fat and high sugar. According to my husband, ice cream should be fatty and sugary. Can’t argue with that if we are talking about a standard ice cream recipe. In his eyes, there was nothing wrong with the ice cream. The app fails to indicate that the brand contains corn syrup. I think it should be broken down better. The rating is poor because it has high sugar content, but not just any sugar. It has corn syrup. I feel the developers should work more into explaining why a high sugar rating deems a product poor. Not everyone is well versed with the dangers of sugars, real or fake.",Amazing!

i know the app is still fairly new and the interface and features it offers outside of just listing ingredients and letting you know if there bad then offering recommendations it doesn't do a whole lot more. I like that it keeps of history of barcode scans, i wish it had a feature to incorporate online shopping. Me personally i dont shop alot in stores and without a physical barcode it makes buying things online still risky. so that could be a cool feature.

I initially used it to scan my previously purchased foods and hygiene/cosmetic products, and now I use it every time I shop. I even became a Premium member in order to look up products I can’t scan (like when I’m shopping online). I have very sensitive skin and have often dealt with contact dermatitis, burning, itching, and other adverse reactions. Being able to find and switch to products that don’t contain potential allergens or harmful chemicals has given me peace of mind and much happier skin. I also like to eat as cleanly as I can, and Yuka facilitates that. It’s a lot easier to simply not buy a food at the store when it’s rated poor or bad, and, if I decide to buy it anyway, it’s a no-brainer to eat it sparingly. It’s amazing and disheartening how many processed foods that claim to be super healthy actually aren’t healthy at all. Needless to say, Yuka has saved me from being deceived and wasting money.

 Some ideas I have for this app are ones that will make it easier to purchase items, for example… let’s say a cereal brand you have been buying products from is not healthy, and you tap on a similar, but healthier alternative, it would make it very convenient if you could tap it and add it to a personalized in app grocery list, for when you go to the store.

Sometimes, items will say they contain harmful materials, but READ THE DESCRIPTION! I have found, with my own scans, sometimes the harmful ingredient is only harmful in certain situations, and the product I scanned DOES NOT fall in that category. So the descriptions of these ingredients is, in a sense, a copy/paste, but not in a bad way. This actually means they research and review ingredients, not products.
Also, as a personal side note, it is NOT an American website/app, which gives it more credibility, to me. I can’t trust these processed-loving Americans….

If the developers are reading this, I would hope that descriptions for healthy/well-rated ingredients will be introduced as well.

Not all ingredients are created the same, so the type of sugar matters, the type of fats matter, the quality of these ingredients matter, and how the body processes and uses the nutrients.  This app will point out that there is too much sugar in a item, then go on to recommend a food with artificial sugar, which is so incredibly damaging to your health.  It will recommend food with highly processed/refined oils, and foods high in glyphosate (which you can’t even read on an ingredient list) you just have to know what foods are heavily sprayed with chemicals, which is why people need good advice from apps like this, not more bad choices to replace the already bad choices.",Does not focus on ingredients and poor alternatives,tiapink13

Now every time I go grocery shopping I scan and know what brands to avoid and which to get. After downloading this app and sticking with my diet of healthy/ organic foods I have to say that I feel younger than my age! I am full of energy and best of all I’m taking care of my health being ! I  highly encourage everyone to download this app and see the great benefits of eating healthy yourself.

But I don’t agree with the rating system. The ratings take a “one size fits all” approach, which limits their usefulness.  Anything it deems too high in sugar, fat, or salt is flagged as “bad”.  For example, it flagged a liquid aminos product I’ve used for years as “bad” because it’s too high in salt.  But I’ve never had high blood pressure, so salt is not a problem for me.  I also think some fat is necessary in one’s diet.  If I were to follow the app’s advice, I’d only eat vegetables and little else.

However, I’m a vegetarian with IBS, so I watch my FODMAP intake.  I didn’t see this information anywhere in the app.

My point is that people are different, so a blanket approach doesn’t work for everyone.

Also, a product like Himalayan Pink salt, which is rich in minerals, has a very different effect on the body than ordinary table salt.  I tried to add it, but the only 2 salt categories were “table salt” and “sea salt” and this is neither.  So I gave up.

This App is so easy to use, yet so revealing that we filled a garbage can with food and cosmetics that were filled with hazardous ingredients. 

It is very revealing to find the number of hazardous elements that are allowed in, not only our cosmetics, but in our food! I was appalled. But Yuka gives us quite a variety of healthy and safe alternatives to replace the items that we threw away. Now we are familiar with the healthy brands and can build a relationship with them. 

I never would have know that certain additives were harmful, even banned by other countries, that are allowed in the products we use in the U.S. So you will not regret downloading this App. All you have to do is scan the barcode on makeup, soap, and foods of every kind to find out if they score Bad-Poor-Good or Excellent. 

On a humorous note, my son scanned my bottle of Jack Daniels whisky and Yuka’s response was, “We do not rate alcohol. But you know what you’re doing.”  We laughed about that for an hour!

I highly recommend Yuka. It will rate your product, give you recommendations and explain what is good or bad about the one rated. Spread the word!",Best App For Healthful Living!,Nonapie

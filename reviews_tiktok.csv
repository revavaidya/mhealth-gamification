Allows you to earn your audience, and build your reputation through producing good content frequently. Over all, there is a very positive vibe on TikTok compared to other social media platforms, and the users seem to keep each other in check when it comes to being negative and bullying. It‚Äôs more entertaining and many times more informative than tv. It gives you a window into real peoples worlds as well, as opposed to Hollywood scripted scenes and scenarios. There are so many creative people out there freely sharing their art forms, and helping each other out, it‚Äôs beautiful to see. 

Downside: TikTok needs to build in a better reporting and appeal system. The current system has been weaponized to attack people simply because of opposing views. (I‚Äôve seen people organize mass reporting parties for TikTok on Twitter.) Which isn‚Äôt fair to people who are working hard to make good clean content that happens to rub another group the wrong way. It can cause their videos to be removed their accounts to be limited or banned unjustly. Meanwhile very problematic content and malicious predatory behavior seems hard to get under control. I suggest more human discernment, deeper investigations into reports, and possibly repercussions for users who abuse the reporting system.",5,False,"TikTok, The Last Frontier",doublepenny

It really annoys me and I take a lot of breaks just because of this new trend it‚Äôs not really good. I know you can‚Äôt control what people post but at draw it to the point, because imagine getting a new puppy then you scroll on TikTok and it says ‚ÄúUse this sound or your dog will die‚Äù and then your puppy dies.

I love the way you can make tiktoks and get many likes on them but there are just some problems that need to be fixed. First, people being inappropriate. They need to fix these inappropriate videos just because everyone wants to scroll through tiktoks seeing normal videos and then coming up to one like these. Second, shadowbanning. I have been shadow banned ever since I posted a day after one of my most liked videos. I‚Äôm getting only likes from my followers and I‚Äôm on the fyp but only getting views. Third, tiktok glitches. My friend made a video and almost the whole video kept on having these grey things that made the video have no potential. She got likes but the video was full of the tiktok glitch. I just want you to fix these things not trying to be rude but just want to have a better experience without having these problems. I also have a good side about tiktok that is just amazing. Tiktok is so amazing and literally you can record ANYTHING without having trouble. You can search up anything you want even stuff you don‚Äôt know and it will pop up.

To be honest this app may change peoples lives because you know you are not alone when it comes to almost ANYTHING. Heck! What this app brings to the world may even save a life or many. I think tik tik took the time to see how we as human beings who are all different try getting certain things out online secretly or wide open bc it is easy when we are behind a screen and as expected responses piled in and this became a true safe haven for anyone and it helped me see that I am not alone and we can no matter how hard things may get someone has shared success so a lot of emptiness fear and don‚Äôt became HOPE  and now and this is a feeling  but also my own knowledge that I have a perfect strangers attention support and guidance as to how they do things.

And once you send an appeal it is already to late and nobody has responded to your appeal and ur account that u have worked hard for is gone , I just feel that TikTok only worries about the more popular side of there app more than the normal people who get there accounts deleted for doing nothing but just being themselves and doing what they like and then getting there accounts felted because some child decided to ruin what that person has built for themselves by just writing a small sentence and saying that they are underaged I just think that someone should monitor the account before making the decision of deleting it , There is also Aton of other issues like filters not being open to some people in certain places and TikTok being weird with updates and more.",4,False,Rant-ish,my little rant
9,2023-10-16 14:54:26,,"Tiktok is great. I love that you can just scroll and take your mind off stuff. And it stays up to date. And one of my favorite parts is that you can scroll past ads. It‚Äôs not just some trap for money. However, I have some complaints.

Firstly, I did not allow access to my contacts and it still very clearly uses them. It may be in the terms and conditions, but I find that very violating.

Secondly, reports. The TikTok moderators never take into account the context of a comment when you report it. And often times, I will report something for very clearly violating something, and nothing happens. I have also had comments removed before, yet brought right back because they were wrong to remove it. The TikTok moderators do not do their job properly. Too many people get stuff removed for no reason, and too many people don‚Äôt get stuff removed when it should be. There needs to be an option to actually type a message when you appeal to plead your case. And there also needs to be a way to appeal a report when it doesn‚Äôt go through, because clearly someone doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing. I have seen someone get banned simply for existing, and yet I report a video for literally having M-rated content with blood and guts, and yet it has ‚Äúno violations‚Äù. Same thing with harming animals. Or just harmful content that is meant to bring others down. This app either needs to remove reporting, or do their job.",3,False,Tiktok,AphroditeXD
10,2023-09-19 19:26:11,,"I love tiktok very much but there‚Äôs a couple things that would make it more enjoyable and less stressful to use. 1. The automatic refresh happens to me all the time where the fyp will refresh without me swiping down and I also just think this feature is annoying altogether. I don‚Äôt understand the point of it. It would be nice if they just had a refresh button that you press rather then having it be a swipe thing because I can‚Äôt tell you how many times it‚Äôs refreshed by itself or on accident when I didn‚Äôt want it to and I‚Äôm never able to find the video I was watching ever again. 2. There‚Äôs so many hate comments on every single video just about and I know tiktok can‚Äôt really do a whole lot about this and it‚Äôs not their fault. However, if you guys had a better moderating system where you monitor the comments on people‚Äôs videos and delete awful comments I feel like that would be useful. Because not everyone wants to go through their comments deleting all the nasty ones and they still have to read them and it‚Äôs just very frustrating to deal with. Other then that, tiktok is an amazing platform and I wish it wasn‚Äôt so toxic from all the horrible hate comments and people who are trolling as well as those bot accounts that are always trying to scam you.

Also, now that I have been on this app long enough to realize the requirements of this judgmental society. It is clear that I think this app is terrific, but I don‚Äôt think the age rating should be 12+ , I would recommend for the app to be 17+ since adults can accept or fulfill the expectations of viewers, but minors may become more affected to the type of ‚Äúfans‚Äù on this platform. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a regular person who complains but I have to say, people should be more careful with what they post, instagram and Snapchat along with twitter are probably completely safer.

It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‚Äòside‚Äô of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.",3,False,Social Work student here!,Zanna .

First of all, the app is addicting. I‚Äôve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could‚Äôve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it‚Äôs partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads ‚Äúopen‚Äù instead of ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. I‚Äôm very frustrated when I can‚Äôt participate in trends because I‚Äôm still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn‚Äôt perfect but if there‚Äôs an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn‚Äôt the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can‚Äôt stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind.

My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It‚Äôs unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I‚Äôve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for ‚Äúviolence‚Äù even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It‚Äôs as if they didn‚Äôt read the actual email at all.

When joining this app, you will experience creative, honest, funny, and tons of different videos. You like the videos you like lost and it creates a for you page for you. But, it will never create a comment section for you. So, there will never ever be a comment section where everyone is nice to each other. You will experience hatred, hate speech, online cyber bullying, and more. I ask whoever is reading this because they‚Äôre scrolling for fun or they want to actually know what it is like to have the app. There is hatred, and it is social media. Every social media is full of it and might effect you in a way you won‚Äôt even realize. Tiktok is an amazing app, because it requires age restrictions to keep children safe, it requires a lot of safety so kids don‚Äôt get hurt. But, if you‚Äôre a mother looking at reviews to see if it‚Äôs safe for you child, then do not let them get it.

If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.,5,True,Ok Social Media App for sharing video,Daddy Milagro

I use TikTok to express myself and have a laugh once in a while, but now all I see is politics and inappropriate dancing. There are only a few good videos and everyone hates on them. I miss old TikTok, where if I was sad I could feel happy. If I was insecure, I would learn that I wasn't alone.

It is completely unfair and unjust.

However, TikTok can be both great and bad for the car community for several reasons. On the positive side, TikTok provides a platform for car enthusiasts to connect and share their love for cars. It allows them to showcase their cars, share tips and tricks, and learn from other enthusiasts. It also allows them to connect with a larger audience and gain exposure for their content. On the negative side, TikTok can also be a breeding ground for misinformation, dangerous stunts, and reckless driving. Some users may post videos of themselves driving recklessly or performing dangerous stunts, which can give the car community a bad reputation. Additionally, some users may spread false information about cars or car maintenance, which can be harmful to both cars and their owners.

For example sometimes the audio just starts glitching and sounding staticky if you‚Äôre recording a video. Another thing is that recently my videos have been delayed after i post them. So i would assume it‚Äôs airpods delay however all my videos are delayed now and that‚Äôs including ones i posted months ago. Also there are a few things that could make the app better like, when you stitch a video instead of the audio not carrying over, you can have a choice on whether you want to continue it or not. I feel that it would be more efficient and a lot easier if you want to finish an old transition you posted or anything else you might need. I also personally liked the old drafts layout, but it‚Äôs fine as is. Another problem is when you‚Äôre watching a video and a text or something may be covered by a profile or the caption or anything else on the side, it‚Äôs hard to see or read anything so I feel there should be a feature where you can swipe to the left and all those buttons would go away sort of like how it is on a live stream. That‚Äôs all I have for now, but Tiktok is a really fun and enjoyable app.",4,False,"Good app, but somethings could change",qywusu

I‚Äôve always thought of the app as very easy to use and accessible to all people (especially with the captions added to the app), but the new update that caused the drafts button to shrink has been a big problem to many creators. People are fond of their privacy, yet they still love the idea of making videos. This leads to many creators making little cringy videos that they would then just save to their drafts to post later or to just save the sound. Many have that muscle memory of just automatically clicking the middle of the drafts button, but because of this new update, they have been accidentally posting their drafts. Not only is this a nuisance to mentally check every time that you are not posting a draft, but it can be very compromising to creators who need videos to be only saved in their drafts, away from their followers. These people would be minors or others who are uncomfortable with their face being public, Islamic women who like making videos with their hair but cannot show their hair to the public for religious reasons, and others who make videos for themselves and not for the public eye.

I saved all the data but the password doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of times. It‚Äôs probably a bug. Anyways, my second ‚Äúbut‚Äù is that even if you don‚Äôt want an account and your trust trying out the app, don‚Äôt pull up the pop-up that says ‚ÄúSIGN UP‚Äù or ‚ÄúLOGIN IN‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext.

Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don‚Äôt want to see the pop-up where it says to ‚ÄúSIGN IN‚Äù or to ‚ÄúLOGIN IN‚Äù.

Within the past year, TT updated their T&C to include a specific ‚Äúcommunity guideline‚Äú that you ‚Äúviolated‚Äú. For a couple of months it was being implemented but now it has gone back to just a notification that your video was removed and one option to press one button, ‚Äúappeal‚Äú. You cannot write or attach any supporting documents when appealing a video that supposedly ‚Äúviolated‚Äú their community guidelines.

Anybody I did try to follow was immediately removed from my list, and any videos I tried to like were no longer listed in my likes. After some googling I found out that TikTok apparently shadowbans you from using the app‚Äôs features if you like too many videos or follow too many people in a short period. I get that this is a feature created to prevent botting, but‚Ä¶ why create an app that‚Äôs meant to keep you scrolling and watching, and customizes the content based what you like and who you follow, and then punishes it‚Äôs users for using these features? I followed so many cool people and now I can‚Äôt even figure out how to find them again because I don‚Äôt remember their usernames and their videos aren‚Äôt in my likes.

I also feel like we should be able to have a story that is up for 24 hours so we don‚Äôt have to make videos about something we want to share that is really not that important. In addition to that, we should be able to repost videos on our story as well. I saw a really REALLY good danganronpa edit and it was SUPER underrated but I couldn‚Äôt share it with anyone because when I duetted it, it only got 2 views in a day.

The other more presentable side is great for us all too, but we get enough of that and I felt like for the first time in forever I could express a creative side that had been dormant so long.

The reason why I say that is because you have to think before you talk or do anything . If you DONT people will cancel you and send you death threats.  And you won‚Äôt even have any time to apologize. On TikTok there is a group of careless teenage boys called ‚ÄúThe Boys‚Äù and they cyber bully EVERYONE that is a poc/minority, lgbtq, or have a disability. If they see that you are one of them they will send you messages that are very harming. Not only that but this app can be very addicting you start to forget about your school work, friends, and even your family. You talk less with the people you love and know and person, because you‚Äôre always obsessed with your videos getting 100+ likes and trying to not get yourself shadow banned. Also I think TikTok should remove the videos for being our pfp because they are the main ones to not get taken down unless you have a lot of people reporting it.

There is too much that the dev team lets the community get away with, and I understand that staff shouldn't be subjected to troubling and disturbing content but it reaches a certain point that there isn't any other choice than to have staff review reports. Not taking action against this issue is what enables people to continue violating your guidelines and until action is taken, people won't stop. To be able to make your platform a safe place, you need to hold your community accountable when it is actively hurting itself, and until you make it known that you're going to be taking action, people will continue abusing the lost reporting system.

My other problem is that you guys have a set up for notifications from what users we want to see. So i enable the notifications on a few of them but i never get notifications despite seeing their content later. I set up notifs on my gf so i can support her and gets others to support her to but anytime she uploads, i never get a notif.

Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for ""being rude to the creator of the dance"" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was ""under review"" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They're just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don't receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers.

Another thing, ive seen people get banned just because someone spam reported them. I mean yes sometimes people do bad things but not show it on tiktok but cmon! There are innocent people who do nothing wrong, like take therians. I‚Äôve seen so many get mass reported so that they get banned. This just makes me so angry.

She won‚Äôt let others help and she literally looks like she‚Äôs on the brink of d3ath and tiktok just promotes her!

Heres some things you should know before saying yes!
tiktok allows you to have a private or public account, public is when anybody on the app can see your videos, private is were everyone has to request to see the account or videos, if a child under the age of 13 asked to get the app, definitely make sure they make their acc private! How to do that is you go to your profile, press the three dots in the right corner of the screen, press privacy and tap the little switch next to the words‚Äùprivate acc‚Äù and there you go! I definitely recommend to make your child's account private, there are many adults on the app that may be a little to creepy. but over all the app is amazing for you child to learn new things and have a fun time! If you are thinking about getting the app yourself Over the age of 15 I definitely recommend it! Its a-lot of fun and you get to show your creativity by roleplays,coloring videos, edits, and really anything!!!!

     First off, the lives. Only people over 1000 followers get to go live, which I think is ridiculous. Maybe you should give new users around 25-50 followers when they first start so at least they have something.  Secondly,  you need to fix your issue where people randomly get suspended by their lives for getting reported. When someone is reporting you should make it a REQUIREMENT to have evidence and if they don‚Äôt have any, their complaint is invalid.  Thirdly, the age limit. It needs to be where people only up to 20-25 should be able to sign up, minus ‚Äúthebentist‚Äù and the other cool, family friendly tik-tokers that everyone loves.

I once posted a video that was inspired by several other videos on the app, which contained short clips of each friend of mine drinking, and then passing the drink to the next person. My video was taken down due to a violation of community guidelines, so I submit an appeal mentioning how everyone in the video was 21. It got put back up but got barely any views, so I reposted it. It got taken down immediately and they did not accept my second appeal? It does not make sense and was not fair considering they accepted my first appeal.

Very informative content, and the algorithm is good at helping you find community and connection. Information is shared quickly, often before it can be censored/shadow-banned. There are downsides: 1. Censorship of content related to human rights, while egregious and hateful content seems to get a pass. (No different than Facebook in that regard.) 2. Spam reporting is a bit of an issue. Even after blocking the user you disagreed with or whom was upset by you in some way, they can and will come in from anonymous other accounts they‚Äôve created to report you. 3. Not everyone can create playlists/folders, so for those that can‚Äôt, their videos end up in one long scrolling feed on their profile, like Instagram.

firstly, i have about 2,800 followers. all of a sudden kids who look to be 7-10 (for SURE not the minimum age of 13!) are following me more than anyone my age (18.) i cosplay so i dont know if its because they see a cool costume or smthn and just follow, but i dont make content for children and removing child follower after child follower is really stressful! i even have 13+ in my bio :( please try to make sure there are only 13+ ppl on ur app. i understand a lot of it is also the parents fault, but maybe theres smthn u could do :/
also, shadowbanning and randomly deleted videos is a huge issue, especially now that BLM is on the rise. if tiktok really supports BLM, then why do my tiktoks on the topic get significantly less views/likes than all of my cosplay videos, even when my followers support the movement too? and i rarely use tags so i should have the same reach as always. please try to focus more on banning people who are spreading hate instead of the people who are working for positivity.
other than these (annoying) issues, i adore this app!! ive made so many friends on it. there are ao many different sides to tiktok, youll for sure find your niche.",3,False,under 13/shadowbanning,Moptheory

During this time, many people are speaking up about the injustices happening (blm) and lots of those videos get taken down when they have not violated any of the guidelines which I personally think is unfair to not only the creator but the people who are also largely invested in the blm movement.

Another example, a girl posted a video of black lives matter, and, you guessed it. That got taken down, too! I just think that they could try harder.

Some hate pages are not terrible but still are hurtful. But there are other hate pages that say very mean and hateful stuff that can affect other people greatly. I have reported an account countless times and so have my friends. It is still up hurting and affecting people and I just think Tik Tok should be more aware of the people that are just on the app to spread hate. And the very last thing is that more small account should get on the for you page and get more views. For example I have three account and one I get many views and likes and on the other no matter what hashtags I use or what sound I still seam to get 5 likes.

At this point tiktok makes you pay for exposure. Good content isnt enough anymore to develop a following making it harder for people without money to grow. Its practically impossible to reach 1k  followers without spending money. It cost me over 100US Dollars just to get my brand name out there and it left me with 240 ish followers. My personal account used to get thousands of views including positive engagement. If I can make good content consistently and grow organically less than a year ago. Then its only safe to assume that tik tok is drowning out the free users now. I understand they have to make money but they were doing fine beforehand and it seems like they have just got greedy ever since the promote feature became a thing. Small businesses and new startups resort to social media for growth and it used to be a good tool for people just starting out making original content. Being original and interesting isnt enough now.. the standard is ‚Äúpay for view‚Äù now unless you already had a large following before the change.,3,False,Okay overall.

One of mine was supposedly reported even though it did not break any community guidelines (and I read the full rules in fine print for the app) and it has been hidden from my profile to everyone for months. This happens on lives as well, if someone reports it the app automatically makes the live stop, even if it did not break any community guidelines. If someone wants to report a video, the video should be visible until deemed otherwise if it is in fact breaking any rules, then it should be deleted. Many users work hard for their content and they shouldn‚Äôt be punished for the small percentage of people who report any random content for whatever pleasure it brings them if it doesn‚Äôt break any guidelines. The app should also notify the user if their video was reported and is under review with factual evidence on why it is under review so the user can learn from it for next time, or if it is a mistake, can be resolved.

They deserve the chance, even if they have -100 fans/followers, that doesn't mean they don't work hard on their Tiktok, they do. And maybe they are proud of them.

It's not always about Charli and the Hype House. It shouldn't be like that. One more thing, i think the number of likes on a video should get hidden but not for the creator, because when a Tiktok with like 80-90 likes get on the foryou page, the people who sees it will not like it EVEN if the content is original and they like it.

Or when we all joined in to make a joke against bigger creators.

to begin with, Videos are getting taken down even though they don‚Äôt violate the guidelines, videos with people telling others to end their lives, insulting them, or copywriting other people‚Äôs ideas will get reported over and over again but they NEVER get taken down. Not to mention toxic channels, I‚Äôm finding channels that only exist to make fun of other people and no matter how many times they get reported nothing happens. Meanwhile people will have their account suspended for saying a swear word or showing a fake weapon/gore.

Also, I‚Äôm constantly seeing popular creators complaining about how at least half of their followers aren‚Äôt seeing their videos. They‚Äôre constantly getting shadow banned for no reason and it really does take a toll on not only their love for this app, but mine too. These people have done nothing wrong and are very unproblematic, the only reason they‚Äôre losing traction is because they‚Äôre cosplayers/trans/add tags about BLM or LGBT.

I had gained a few followers, but then.. the same thing had happened, TikTok logged me out and removed my account. At this point, I was a bit more upset, but still decided to make a third account that included relatable day to day things that most people deal with... the third account had boosted to over 3k followers, after that, I had issues uploading my videos, so I asked TikTok why I had issues with uploads.. and instead of fixing the issue, they fully logged me out and removed my third account.

Whereas before you could scroll freely and see maybe a handful of ads from influencers or content creators collabs, bow there are ads in between videos all across the fyp. Not only are these ads super annoying, but they are also usually from sketchy and low quality brands. To make things worse, you cannot block the businesses accounts or dislike their videos and many brands turn of comments as well. This allows no tik tok users to put any input into their ad experience and leaves me feeling ignored by the app. I also think that having the comments off removes a lot of important aspects of tik tok. Discourse is one of the main functions of the app, so I think it is ridiculous that they want to silence their users to make the advertisers happy.

Another issue is that you have to have 1000 fans to go live, and that lives can easily be shadow banned for no reason, causing it to be extremely difficult to interact with their fans.

The character comment limit is very short so whenever i want to write a paragraph to someone, i just have to reply to my comment over and over. next thing is going live.

It is very difficult to make a new account and try to transfer that email. You cannot change your age at all, so if you accidentally chose the wrong year it gives a disadvantage in reach.

Number two is that you have to add your phone number to send messages to people.

Number three is there being a limit for likes, follows, and comments. By this I mean how you can‚Äôt like multiple videos if you like to fast.

I understand this app is 13+. There are definitely a lot of kids on this app, but there are also LOTS of adults. So many videos have been taken down because kids do not like videos that adults post.

It seems like the ones running the app jus take down any video that‚Äôs reported without even looking at it. But I‚Äôve reported videos that ACTUALLY violate terms and they stay up. Why? .
I think a good update would be to add an 18+ update. I don‚Äôt mean make the whole app 18+, i mean to have it so that profiles can set an 18+ setting on their page so it only shows their videos to people who have put their birthday in and say they‚Äôre 18 or over.

790,2020-05-01 05:17:59,,"I like tiktok and I spend most of my time on this app however they changed the app saying no one under 16 can direct message. I had this app since it was musically and I‚Äôve always sent messages to friends and now I can‚Äôt.  I only use direct message for sending tiktoks to my best friend who is the same age as me. We are both 15 and thinks that this change is not necessary. If you are going to have an app labeled as 12+ but won‚Äôt let you message on it you might as well make the app 16+. Also not to mention that the app says it has mild profanity, mild and suggestive themes that are mature, sexual content and nudity, the use of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Which isn‚Äôt okay for anyone of age 12 to see. So if 12 year olds can see that but 15 year olds can‚Äôt messages friends there is something wrong with this app.  As well as the issue of tiktok only putting pretty people on the tiktok for you page. This app is exposing young kids to think they have to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù to be popular or liked. If tiktok is going to show girls in bikinis dancing around but won‚Äôt show heavy set people or people of different races dancing fully clothed on the for you page to young kids it teaches them that they need to look like those girls.

It‚Äôs also really annoying because of how famous people get more privileges! Second, only some people get verified! A lot of people are great creators and are asking to be verified but they never do, plus nobody even knows the criteria for being verified. Third, tik tok takes down so many videos for no reason! They need to update there methods of making sure videos are good or bad because so many awesome videos with many views and likes get taken down because a few people reported it. And most of the time the videos are not at all inappropriate. -I feel like it‚Äôs mostly girls affected too!- and last, there is so much hate on tiktok and I don‚Äôt know how the creators could fix this but they need to find a way to not let hate comments be made on videos.

But now that you have the age limit set to 16 I didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue since, I am of age. But after a suspension I provided proof of age with a drivers license and with the appeal it was said the records would be kept and the issue resolved which, it was. But, after about 15 minutes going live after my appeal was looked at I was again, suspended for not meeting age requirements. It‚Äôs very frustrating and aggravating to see that even if you are of age and you‚Äôre following the guidelines you‚Äôll get suspended either way. I can not submit another appeal as it says I have ‚Äúalready submitted one and should wait‚Äù.

 1 problem is, it bans me all the time for no reason.
My 2 problem is that when it banned me the last time it would not let me create another account, so I deleted tiktok then redownloaded it. Once I redownloaded it I made a new account and it started me off without any of the new updates or anything and it was like when tiktok was first created, which I hate what it was like then, it really annoys me. And the App Store was not letting me update it. Finally it gave me an option to update it but all it did was add the mirror option and did not change anything else. I still have the old stuff like the blue line across the top when you are filming, not an option for a story, or a now. REALLY ANNOYING. I‚Äôm still unable to update it.

I liked it when the video failed to post and it just goes on as a private, but now there are drafts and when you post it again, there is still a draft for it. This is really annoying.

Tic toc is different in that it openly informs users about how they tap into data (as well as your preferences noted while on the app) to create an awesome endless array of content that is truly customizable to the user.

For context, this post is being written two days after a white man killed 8 people ( 6 of them Asian women ) in a killing spree in Atlanta. You‚Äôd think users, especially users of color, would want to see more videos regarding the heinous hate crime that happened. Instead, so many people had their For You pages covered with videos of white creators doing irrelevant things and whatever it is they do. TikTok claims to care about minorities on their app but they‚Äôre only saying it so that they look good. They did the exact same thing by shadowbanning/removing Black creators videos last month and before that whenever they talked about racism or police brutality.

One of the best things about TikTok is the community that it has built. The app has a vast user base from all over the world, and it is a great platform for people to connect and collaborate. Users can follow each other, like videos, and leave comments, creating a positive, engaging environment that encourages creativity and self-expression.

Another feature that sets TikTok apart from other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app uses a powerful algorithm that analyzes user data to recommend videos that they are likely to enjoy. This means that users can discover new content and creators that they might not have found otherwise, making the app a great source of inspiration and entertainment.

Overall, TikTok is an excellent app for anyone who wants to create and share short-form videos. With a plethora of editing tools, effects, and filters, the app allows users to unleash their creativity and produce videos that are fun, engaging and shareable.

Users who post the video should also have access to enabling things like sensitive content, flash warnings or make their own custom warnings for a certain audience, this is because A LOT of things are looked over by tiktok so they could use the extra help.

I am a tik toker and I'm not famous or anything
but I love TikTok I love how everyone comes
together. From many with disabilities to
discovering new things and so much more
everyone has someone who loves them and I
love that. I love all content from animals to
fashion. Trendsetters and so much more
TikTok has changed the game in a way that
cannot be copied by any other platform. Given
everyone an opportunity in this world to shine.
Everyone has fame and fame is something
chased by many on every level. TikTok is a
safe place for some therapeutic for many and
a place for the socially conservative or anti
social to come be free. However I think there
should be some changes such as the protocol
to TikTok removing videos of creators for
nudity just for doing the same trend a verified
user does. Favoritism maybe call it whatever
but something is definitely fishy about this
because I've seen so many get banned
blocked and removed for shaking their
bottoms with sweat pants on but the verified
users or people with more followers get away
with it. Also if your over 18 you should be able
to post whatever content to extent long as
your not promoting anything inappropriate. My
biggest issue is that I find TikTok allowing only
certain creators to be nude or inappropriate
but if I were to wear panties and do a dance it
would be considered nudity or whatever
please fix that it's not fair.

1132,2023-03-08 23:38:26,,"Hello everyone,

Today I wanted to take a moment and talk about how great TikTok has been for me. I know that some people may be a bit skeptical about using this platform, but I am here to tell you that you won't regret it.

When I first joined TikTok, I was a bit overwhelmed. There were so many different videos and trends that I had to familiarize myself with. But I soon saw the value in utilizing this platform as a means of connecting with other people. 

Once I got the hang of TikTok, I started to establish an audience of followers. I was amazed at how quickly my videos were being seen and shared. It felt so rewarding to have people watching and engaging with my content. I soon realized that the level of engagement and reach that I could get on TikTok was much greater than anything I could accomplish on other social media platforms.

The most impressive thing about TikTok is the way it allows my audience to interact with me. With the comment sections, I can get direct feedback from people who are interested in what I have to say. This allows me to create content that is tailored to their wants and needs.

Overall, TikTok has been an incredible platform for me to explore my creativity and connect with other people. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a way to share their voice and reach a larger audience.

Thank you for watching, and remember to keep on creating!",5,False,My experience,Anthonydelves7

It‚Äôs because if they get rid of their bigger influencers, the bc TikTok will get worse and worse ratings until they collapse. I even remember my older stepsister posting the stupidest content I‚Äôve ever seen! But  TikTok abided with it! And the few people that saw my content actually loved it! So I‚Äôm not saying TikTok is a bad platform even though it kind of is, it‚Äôs addicting and all that but what I‚Äôm really saying is that TikTok wants to ban people not by their age at all but for how many followers are there to back them up. The whole thing is just corrupt and it‚Äôs a platform for toxic people addicted to their phone!

I sometimes see inappropriate things on this app, and tiktok needs to look further into taking a closer look into reports of videos and accounts.

of course tiktok can be a fun platform to create and see others creations, but my personal experience was very toxic. i was always comparing myself to other influencers who are more attractive than me, skinnier than me, got more likes than me, cooler than me, more creative than me, etc. (yes, i know that‚Äôs a me-problem, not a problem with tiktok itself)
tiktok is also extremely addictive. myself and many others find it easy to spend five hours scrolling through the fyp like it‚Äôs nothing. i was wasting my life. in the end, i gained absolutely nothing from tiktok (except a deep hatred for social mediaüòç)!!!

Sometimes it's frustrating especially if I can't add the sound I want because I either hit the wrong button. Sometimes I will have to turn off voiceover to add some sounds. Another voiceover suggestion would be to fix the tabs at the very bottom, your profile tab, the search tab, and the home tab which is default when you first launch the app. I would also suggest fixing the share button and labeling the options for a voiceover to speak to sharing options when sharing the video because that's also a problem.

There aren‚Äôt many but if I were to make one tiny adjustment, I would make it to where you can fast forward and rewind on a TikTok. Even if it were to only work on a video that‚Äôs over 15 seconds. I do realize that not having the ability to fast forward or rewind may be better for the creator, but if you‚Äôve already watched the whole video and just missed one tiny spot, it would be more convenient. Even if you couldn‚Äôt  fast forward/rewind until after you‚Äôve watched the whole video, it would be a lot better.

So I‚Äôm 42 and came here to laugh and was encouraged by my children to promote my small artist business. I have been so blessed to grow to the point I got the creator fund account. Since I got it I have only heard and see  negative feedback. I hope this does not hinder my work. I do appreciate the platform and all it does add. I wish there was more concrete ways to make money(guides and exact money that can be made- I see the billon dollar vow and hope to be a part of it- not just pennies for hours of hard work)on videos and not have to be a celebrity to get noticed. I do wish for the positive nature to continue and praise the support. I wish there was guidance on making sure my account is in good standing and will continue to perform well. I am thankful for friends I have made and sales with customers that built friendships.

You just send requests to people you want to follow who have private accounts, and vice versa. Nobody can just look you up, and look at your posts/videos. My only doubt about TikTok is: You could look up a famous person on TikTok, and follow them, and chances are they don't have a private account. So you can look at whatever they post publicly. But overall, it's one of the best apps for children, teens, or even adults with the best privacy and safety. (Think about it as Instagram for a ""kinder"") When you put your age, it has a range.

TODAY'S SCRIPTURE:

I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
Psalm 32:8

TODAY'S WORD:

Many times we don‚Äôt realize that God is speaking to us. We feel an impression on the inside, a prompting to be good to someone. That‚Äôs not random. That‚Äôs God talking to us. Or, maybe you‚Äôre in a situation where you feel an uneasiness. Something says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right. Stay away.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just your nerves. It‚Äôs God protecting you. Don‚Äôt ignore it, don‚Äôt talk yourself out of it; just obey. If you‚Äôll follow that still, small voice, God says He will guide you along the best path for your life. If we‚Äôre listening to His still, small voice‚Äîthe promptings, the suggestions, the alarms‚ÄîHe will save us from heartache and pain. He‚Äôll lead us into promotion and favor. Too often we feel these impressions on the inside, but we dismiss them as not making sense, or override or overanalyze them. Don‚Äôt talk yourself out of it. Just obey. Anytime you obey, a blessing will always follow.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

‚ÄúFather, thank You for loving me and for speaking to my heart. Thank You for giving me an inner ear to know right from wrong. Help me to be sensitive to Your still, small voice and hear it with clarity, to hear any alarms, promptings, and suggestions, and to be quick to obey.

It sounds minor, but with the amount of ads you inevitably see when you're scrolling for hours (because we all know you will) it gets genuinely frustrating seeing so many videos that could not pertain to your interests any less. The algorithm is incredible at holding attention as is. Hiding ads between popular videos I don't even want to see isn't going to make me any more likely to watch them.

around 80% of the patterns I see depend on tiktok. Anything can circulate around the web there in under
60 minutes. About age limits, I wouldn't suggest this application for anybody under 12, since it
has reviling, and content that isn't proper for more youthful crowds, in any case, if it
is a parent overseen account, guardians can handle what their kid watches, what
their youngster posts, they can make the record private, with the goal that no one but companions can see their posts,

Sometimes it can be very good sometimes it can have its conflicts but overall it‚Äôs a great app experience and app. I would recommend this app to a lot of people but some people think there are too many things wrong with TikTok that they just don‚Äôt want it. But an issue with it is that it saves videos to my camera roll and it‚Äôs quite annoying sometimes. And also I think that is an issue because if I run out of storage space it will not let me make videos and I think that is a major problem. Because tons of people around the world might not have storage space and they can‚Äôt make videos to share with the world! So I think you should change that about your app so people all over the world can share their experiences with each other and to the people on this earth! Over all this platform is very very good!

I fully believe that you guys don‚Äôt review the entire content of a video and try to understand what someone is saying. IE: when someone calls out a creator or comment for abusive content to bring a bright light on the subject you punish the victims. This is much like the judicial system protection of a rapist and not the victim. Blaming the victim of a crime is asinine. You should probably find better content reviewers who actually know what bulling really is. Also if someone threatens the life of the president it shouldn‚Äôt take someone reporting them to the FBI before you actually do something. I‚Äôve seen this to many times on this platform and it is very revealing of where your offices stand on your duty as a honest platform that cares about democracy.

My idea is that maybe there can be an option where people could boost someone and the more boosts they get, the closer they get to possibly getting verified. Now of course people could only boost the person once to prevent someone from verifying random accounts. Another idea I had was for the gifts and extra things some creators get. For example, on Halloween, some creators got chocolate shaped like a cupcake with treats inside. I was thinking about maybe giving out rewards to those who have been with TikTok for a while and contribute their money to things such as livestreams, merch, etc. that‚Äôs all for now.

There was a video posted about me, where I didn‚Äôt even do anything wrong.

1484,2020-11-06 14:21:35,,I‚Äôm just suggesting some stuff for the app. So first I think if this app is rated 12+ that anyone should be able to live stream if their 12 or older and that all live streams that were banned so to age should be unbanned and I think you shouldn‚Äôt have to have 1k to live stream and that any follower count should be aloud because a lot of smaller creators want to live stream. I also think that video should be able to be longer it would help make a lot of videos. And I think that one popular filter that has the line that goes across the screen and that make you pause but the real you can do whatever should be aloud in America because a lot of people want to use it. I also think  you should be able to put favorited videos in to folders I‚Äôve wanted to show my friends a video or just watch a video my self but I can‚Äôt find.

However, tik tok does not do anything about the white racist tiktokers on here. This app is very biased when it comes to being fair to creators of color or to white creators. The fact that most black creators are getting their videos removed just for adding one tiny bad word in their TikToks is ridiculous, especially since white creators are just getting a slap on the hand for saying the n-word.

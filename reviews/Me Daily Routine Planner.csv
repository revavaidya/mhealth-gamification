I love that the developer is responding and working on resolutions. But 1  thing that is irritating to me is the complaints about the cost. I'm not sure if you all realize that there is alot of time and effort by people behind the scenes that make this app even  possible. They deserve to get paid for their work which includes ongoing updates and changes to the app.. This is their job!  A lot of you feel like because it's a wellness app it should be free? What?! Do you know how much it would cost to go to a therapist that can also provide you tools to use? It's baffling that people want the developers to run this app for free because it's a ""wellness app"" but you buy starbucks and order doordash, and pay for tv apps, concert tickets and other unnecessary things but complain a app that averages out to be $3.33 a month for something that actually helps you.

I also would not recommend this for any body younger than 13 just because if I had a child, I would not want my child to use an app and pay for some thing without me knowing. This but you just can‚Äôt trust younger children sometimes. Also, I feel like some of the prices are a little too high. 
People who are trying to get out of the depths of their despair, or lack of motivation, or anything else, sometimes they don‚Äôt have the money and that would just make me feel as if my capability to better myself all depends on if I can afford it if I didn‚Äôt have the money to use this app. Although, I understand that you are small business and that you‚Äôll need the money.

Secondly the ability to edit future dates needs to be added instead of asking to focus on today (most people plan for the week or month all at once and do not have time to edit their schedule daily). Thirdly when editing the details of a task it should not reset the task and erase any previous data related to that task. Fourthly there has been several times I have gotten into the app and all the tasks are gone.

My advice is to do what a lot of other apps do that are insanely successful now (and I regularly subscribe to), and allow free usage for a few days, perhaps even in a limited fashion, where you only get access to parts of it, and then ask for me to subscribe, after I‚Äôve already been inside the app and know what exactly I‚Äôm signing up for.

My suggestions to improve the app:
- Allow back dated mood entries. My day typically ends around 10pm/11pm, so when I go to do my daily reflection it may be beyond midnight. This posts for the current day, not the day prior, and there is no way to adjust it, that I know of.
- Allow adjustments to future to do lists. I try to edit or adjust chores in the following days, and I get a purple bar that tells me to ""focus on today"". It is a bit annoying, and I tend to forget things easily (hence why I have this app) and that would be really beneficial to me if I could adjust things as I think about it, whether it be a day or a week from now. If there is a way to do this, it would be helpful to have an easier way of doing it.

These methods no longer work for today's generation of users, and it's disappointing to see a self-care app designed to help people grow and reach their full potential blocked by a paywall.

It's ironic that the only people who can afford to pay for this app are those who are already relatively stable in life and may only be using the app to maintain their status quo. The developers should consider alternative methods to encourage users to upgrade to the pro version. For example, they could offer purchasable in-app themes to customize the UI and make the app feel more cozy, warm, bubbly, or zen.

Locking mundane features that are free in other apps is pointless because users will simply switch to another app. It's time for developers to think outside the box and offer creative ways to enhance the user experience. It's frustrating to see potential wasted when developers continue to rely on outdated tactics. We hope to see more innovative ideas in the future.

1. When you add a task, it doesn‚Äôt always stay in the same order that you set/moved it on the list. As someone with ADHD, I NEED to have these in a certain order to organize my day. Why don‚Äôt they stay in the order you put them in? I‚Äôm not trying to scroll to the bottom of the list to find things I‚Äôm trying to do in the morning. 

 2. There‚Äôs no way to edit future tasks!! If you accidentally put a task on the wrong day a month from now, good luck changing it! You have to wait a month to change/delete it. Or if your schedule changes and you want to move the task? Nope. Set in stone. Makes planning impossible. 

I LOVED this app otherwise, and I had NO problem paying for something that really helps!! But these two factors make it useless, especially for something you‚Äôre going to pay so much money for. Let me know when these are fixed and I‚Äôll be back. So disappointing. 

The only other small issue is the icons. There aren‚Äôt enough of them to match tasks and many of them are duplicates (why do I need three of the same bed or sponges?).

Furthermore, the pre-created routines offered by the application are limited and not tailored to individual needs, which defeats the purpose of using such an app. Instead of providing a range of helpful and customizable routines, the application only offers a few basic routines that you can add to your plan AFTER you buy the subscription.

This approach not only limits the usefulness of the app, but it also seems to prioritize profit over the needs of the ADHD community. It is important to create an environment where individuals with ADHD can thrive, and an application that requires payment for basic features does not foster such an environment.

Overall, I would not recommend this application to anyone looking to improve their ADHD symptoms. With limited routines and a focus on profit, this app falls short of what is needed to support those with ADHD.",1,False,Limited and Profit-Driven,alnima14,Me Daily Routine Planner

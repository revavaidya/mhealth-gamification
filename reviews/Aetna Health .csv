Those that are have an ! In their info that says they’re In Network but ‘certain providers may be out of network for certain specialities at this location: Cardiology’. How can that be? Functionally those two specialties are the same thing. All a Cardiologist does is Cardiology, how can he be listed as out of network for a location for the only thing he does there? The doctors office themselves says they take Aetna insurance all the time, but then what does that ! mean? 

On the website it says nothing about out of network specialties for any provider and it even lets me use the price estimation tool for that location. Aetna needs to get their information correct one way or another, most people can’t waste time or money accidentally going to an appointment for a provider that’s actually out of network because the app and website have different info. 

Calling is no help either, I’ve gotten 2 opposite answers from 2 different people, but the second person emailed me a provider list as proof showing the doctor I want to see as In Network as a Cardiovascular Disease Physician.

So far, I didn’t see refund logged for the claim on the Aetna mobile app, so I thought my payment was processed and sent to the provider successfully.

Then, why the refund wasn’t shown app soon? And, why payment process didn’t work? Why the provider never cash my payment, is it their fault or Aetna’s fault?

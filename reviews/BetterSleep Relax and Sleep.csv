So rated 5 stars now for developer help and good answer!

Decided to check this app out again after several years (I bought the lifetime subscription back before there was a lot of other subscription options) and remember being able to use this app with music I had in my iPhone, with the app itself. (So if you had relaxing music, you could have that playing while also having the sounds the app had as well) However I noticed, now it doesn‚Äôt use that as an option anymore :( Just wanted to write this review, in case the developer will check this review out with an answer to if there is a reason for this or not (I‚Äôd understand if Apple came back at them saying they aren‚Äôt allowed to use music from people‚Äôs music library, but otherwise I feel like it would be something they should add back in, if possible) It‚Äôs cool that they supply other music options, but would really like to use some music that I‚Äôd provide, just for myself personally.

I sleep better and have been doing so for 7+ years after downloading. I deactivated my old account & deleted the app because I wanted to live without it since I slept better, but times I needed the app again. I redownloaded as a result & suddenly I have the free sounds. I saw the sweet hour prayer locked and felt bad even the other ones I‚Äôve had immense dreams with. After hearing the ones I heard now (because I heard them too), it took me back to the dreams I had when I fell asleep with the sounds. I know, sounds weird, but I have memories even with sound and then I remember the DREAMS I had so good. I remember from the middle (a little of the beginning) and mostly the ending of my dreams, so I can picture them thanks to the sounds.

A decade at least!), I consistently use this app. It‚Äôs always improving, even though I‚Äôve never personally found it lacking. It‚Äôs amazing to have so much ability to customise mixes. I like layering multiple water sounds, brown noise, and a little quiet thunder. It‚Äôs created an almost Pavlovian response; I start playing my mix, and next thing I know, I‚Äôm asleep. 

I‚Äôve struggled with sleep my entire life, partially due to just luck with biology, and also severe PTSD. I used to wake dozens of times in a night. Every small sound or shift in the room or house, and I‚Äôd be awake, full of anxiety. And certain sounds/frequencies bother me and/or trigger migraines, and that made it hard to play sounds that would both sufficiently drown out the tiny noises and also not leave me in pain.

It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this app. In a good way. Better sleep is like a friend. A life long dear friend.....no....it's more like.....it's a compassionate experience like what you get when you're a child held by your mother. The voice overs are so gentle and inviting while the background music is so magical and mood inspiring. The stories are something you can't help but embrace. The meditations are guided by the narrator as if it's a teacher in your room. Better sleep is my hero. Wonder if this could have saved mom if I had known abiut better sleep back then.

2021-06-15 08:01:38,,"I downloaded all the Ipnos apps ages ago, and they were some of my favorites. But, they became out of date. I recently rediscovered the fully reworked Relax Melodies, and it seems they‚Äôve wisely decided to concentrate their attention on a single app with a subscription service. But, my old purchase with access to sounds was retained (before subscribing), giving me confidence that they are a good company.

The strength of the app is the design / visuals. It is quite beautiful and relaxing to look at before you even use it. But, as a person who has long suffered with insomnia, it‚Äôs clear that the developers are actually dedicated to the function of the app. I love the random feature - choosing sounds added a bit of anxiety for me (as a perfectionist, I wanted to try them all and create unique combos). Luckily, I can pay ppl to do that for me, and it makes my life a little easier. 

But, the new expanded app is not just a noise machine. It has breathing exercises, meditations, and stories which make up most of the content. What started as a simple concept is now a one stop sleep app. I‚Äôve also tried Insight Timer and Calm, plus various music apps, but this one seems like it might be my favorite for bedtime.

There's lots of customization available: there are many sound options (both ambient and musical), you can control the volume of each added element and you can even add binaural beats or isochronic tones to enhance your experience (e.g. deep meditation, relaxation, concentration). I've been looking for a good sound machine app and this app is a perfect fit. I use it mainly to concentrate & focus at work. But I used one of the meditations before bed the other night & fell right to sleep. So it's great for concentration AND relaxation. 

The only thing I'm missing is the ability to add some of my own recorded sound bites. I thought I could because it allows you to use your own music, but I have some clips of my dog barking, my phone ringing, background office chatter, etc, that I wanted to mix in with the included sounds and I don't see any way to do that.  Other than that, it meets all my expectations plus there are some nice guided meditations. :)

So if you have the money buy the app but if you can‚Äôt afford just be careful so that you don‚Äôt fall into some trap and get charged for $40 dollars.

I love that you can select multiple sounds to play at the same time, adjust the volume of each sound individually, and save mix to your profile. I have the app on my phone and iPad and logging in allows me to use either one and have the same mixes saved. 
Overall I definitely recommend this app, but will say there are two small downsides.  #1 there are A LOT of sound options, maybe too many in my opinion. It can be overwhelming when trying to put together sounds ""should I pick wind or breeze?

I recently went into on both my iPhone and iPad mini to find most of my mixes locked out because I did not have a 'Pro' subscription.

And yet I must have had access to those sounds in the past because I was able to create the mixes.

In an attempt to troubleshoot I went ahead and registered for their new account feature to see if maybe that would spur things and it promptly deleted all of my mixes.

This is on top of a previous bug in the Relax Meditation app where sounds had claimed to be no longer download and wouldn't download again.  A response to a support ticket was to delete and redownload the app, which would also destroy all my mixes.

I saw noticeable differences in my sleep so I knew it would be worth the investment to purchase the full app. I even recommended this app to a number of friends and family.

UPDATE: After a timely exchange with their support I was able to get my sounds and melodies back. This is a good business practice. Back to 5 stars.

UPDATE 2: and it‚Äôs all gone again. You would think that if you pay for something you would get all the product you pay for and at least get to keep it. Nope!!! I paid money to unlock everything years ago and they move to the subscription style and just like that everything I had is gone.

Is there anything worse than disrupted sleep?! Especially when it happens multiple times nightly?!

It's greatest advantage over other similar apps is that you build your own tracks by individually choosing sounds, controlling their individual volume and intensity.

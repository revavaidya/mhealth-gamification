I’m back to download on my new phone, because this app is so pretty and easy to use. I was able to retrieve all my input without creating an account. I’m so grateful for that! Thank you.
When you delete a message there seems to be no way to restore it; there is no trash file. I think I like that. Yes, I’m okay with that.
I love the cute little face on the weather-inspired-mood icons. Every day, the app sends me a reminder to make a note, at a time that I set for the day. I love this feature. I don’t do it often, and it doesn’t mind.
I also like that I can include activities going on and I can create personalized activities! It really helps to see what else is effecting my mood.
The only complaint I have: it sends me a quote every day. The SAME quote every day for 4 months now. I can’t find where to switch it up or switch it off. Edit: They have stopped sending the same quote everyday...they have stopped sending any quotes at all. I thought the idea of daily quotes was neat, but the same one everyday was silly.

It gives me a gift in the morning when I log in for the day but it’s always the subscription over and over again asking me to purchase the stupid free trial (WHICH IS ONLY A WEEK LONG, then $8 something monthly) There is the “don’t show again” button which is definitely helpful. But not even just that, you can only do several (if even that) of the tests/quizzes without purchasing the subscription. I’ve only been able to do 1 while being ftp!! And there’s so many tests and quizzes on top of that, so why can’t you make a little more than a handful free to do?!

The tests are riddled with typos, and some questions make no sense at all. There is also a disappointing number of courses, and they really only explore issues at a very surface level. A paragraph and a few lines of text (at BEST) is what constitutes a lesson. From the high price and advertisements I’ve seen, I was expecting a lot more substance. I have been diagnosed with a few mental issues which are moderate to severe, and I’ve been in therapy for a while. If you’re considering getting this app and have tried therapy before, it will be a waste. If you’ve never tried therapy, you may get something out of the lessons but it will be very shallow. I recommend checking out other online resources. The ONLY redeemable feature of this app is the mood tracker. I like how you can easily see how your mood fluctuates, the ease in tracking activities related to your moods, and the ability to add a photo to the day is a nice touch.

The aesthetic is extremely nice and I can tell the devs worked really hard to give the users a nice experience. However, with that being said, the paid subscription feature is extremely ridiculous. Over $8 a week is a bit much if you ask me… I feel like the addition of a paid subscription at all is a poor choice considering it’s a MENTAL HEALTH app, designed to make people feel better. It completely goes against what the app is preaching. What makes it worse is that there are little to no free features without the subscription, so the app is almost useless without it. (Pretty much all the tests are locked and most other features are unavailable as well.) The daily mood thing is nice, and I like how it tracks how you feel each time you fill it out but that’s just about the most useful thing on there without the subscription. I feel as though the subscription should just be removed completely, because it seems really selfish of the devs to add such a thing.

I have downloaded this in the past, but not for the free features, and due to the features locked behind money I was fairly quick to uninstall.

For example, the pre-loaded markers for “what are you doing” when you submit a mood (e.g. “sad”) have some normal things like exercise and eating, but also some that are not even activities like, “travel tips.” The quizzes have questions that aren’t comprehensive by any means, which would be ok if they made any sense. The questions are sometimes not just poorly worded, but actually nonsensical. I hope no one uses these quizzes to figure out if they have signs of anxiety etc. I don’t know where they got these assessments but they appear autogenerated or something. For example, it will say “how often do you feel sad?” And then the options will be “not at all, mildly - it didn’t impact me.” The subscription is incredibly expensive for what this app is, which leads me to believe this is a scam.

Of course I got an “androgynous” result because I consider myself self sufficient and ambitious. I don’t think that makes me any less feminine.

Its strongest point is the the daily check-in tool. You enter brief notes about your mood and current activity, and you can track daily progress over time. This would serve well for someone practicing cognitive behavioral therapy or someone who wants to quit an addictive habit like smoking. 

My biggest issues with the app were the personality tests and the outdated language. The personality tests are very narrow in focus and frequently used biased language. The love language test, for instance, assumes romantic involvement, and frames most of the options in terms of partners. Many of the others have the similar shortcomings. The depression test was the strongest one, likely because it is an actual psychological mood indicator backed up by research, and I did not feel that the results were influenced as strongly by bias from me or the test. For an app that asks for a paying subscription, I feel that the developers could spend more resources on getting similar tests that are up to date and backed by research. 

As far as language is concerned, it is not inclusive. There was the partner-focused terminology in the love language test, and overall there is an abundance of either the neutral “he” or “he/she” where the neutral “they” would suit better. It’s a small detail, but it becomes large since people who are drawn to apps like this also struggle with some version of gender and body dysphoria, or inclusion issues in general. Using more inclusive language recognizes that more than one type of person exists and validates the experience of people who feel like outsiders irl.",4,False,Useful as a mood check-in tool but shallow,also_skeptical,Breeze Mental Health

I love being able to log my emotional state in about 30 seconds; once you get the hang of it, and set up the icons to things more in your life. It’s simple and to the point. The stats page is the best part of this app.

   I am not a big fan of the “Insights” section. But you can tell it is a work I progress, and that is getting better with the very nice regular updates. I did pay for the year Premium, I hate ads. If you don’t mind ads, this app is a steal for free. Just pay attention to what you clicking on, to many reviews where people are just not paying attention. Read before you click.

    Some con’s are “Notifications/Reminders”
      -Give the ability to create as many reminders as needed. Don’t want to clog up my iOS reminders. Currently, Breeze only lets you set 1 reminder inside the app. I like things all wrapped up and contained in the apps themselves.
     -The cloud slider is too limited, if I am angry, frustrated, even frightened. The words to pick from are there…but the slider and cloud only has Unhappy, sad, bad, normal, good, great, happy. When I’m angry, bad and sad, are not quite the right ones for me.I know the key words are there I would just like some angry types in there. It would make it easier to quickly identify those times from the front page.

Remember this is a tool not, not a magic pill to cure what ever you think you have. Because if you think this will fix you, then you haven’t seen a professional yet, or didn’t listen to them. You need to use it, and see the professional together.

      In reality, the reminders is the only actual con, the slider is just a personal preference. Fix that reminders issue, and it will be a 5 start app. IMO.",4,False,A great tool.,elwayfan1983,Breeze Mental Health

I added a mood but accidentally saved it with an uppercase letter. This app doesn’t let you edit an existing emotion (to rename or change the icon). Instead I deleted and re-added my custom emotion with all lowercase letters, but somehow it didn’t wipe the database when I deleted because it reverts back to the previous capitalization. Very frustrating. Let me properly change capitalization and let me edit any/all moods. -1 ⭐️

Because this app doesn’t let you edit existing or custom emotions, I tried replacing one by deleting the original. Unfortunately, the icon used in the original is not available in the icon list (piggy bank icon) or I did not see it after looking through three times. This is either poor design or poor oversight. -1 ⭐️. I would like more icons to choose from, like yoga.

This is otherwise a lovely app, beautiful to look at and easy to use. I’ve used it less than a week but I want to see if this app makes it easy for me to understand the effects of things like sleep quality, exercise, and other activities on my mood. I’ve only briefly glanced at the graphs and look forward to diving into these after a decent amount of data collection.

Every time I enter a mood, the app bugs me to rate it with a pop up that blocks all other activity until dismissed. This is an aggressive design tactic that I wish dies in a fire. Please use a more gentle method. I haven’t been using this all consistently or long enough to provide a review that I would deem thorough enough. This is annoying.

So, as with anything, companies have jumped on this. Some good things are we are able to find apps and info almost anywhere. However, the bad side is greed. And, yes, I’m going to say greed here, despite everyone’s love affair with capitalism and everyone NEEDING to make a profit. The health industry is where I REALLY can’t excuse the greed as this can be a matter of life and death. I downloaded the app (based on an add on Instagram of all places; I should have known something was up because it was on there, lol) and started reading it. I thought this would be a nice digital journal and tracker; it looks great, I’ll give it that. I saw a free trial and that caused me to pause. I’ve used these apps before and never had a free trial. Were there pays versions? Yes, but I was able to use the app pretty well without paying anything. I dismissed the pop up and hope it didn’t sign me up for a free trail, anyway. I’ll check in a moment when I delete this app. 
Now, the reason for how I started this review. I saw the “premium” area. This app is $8, which I thought wasn’t too bad for a monthly fee, but then I saw that I’d misread that. It’s $8 A WEEK?! Not only does that defeat the entire purpose of what this app is supposedly trying to do (a lot of our mental issues stem from the pressures created by capitalism, yet here’s an app jumping right on in there, pushing it in our faces more), but $32 a month seems way too much for a journal and info that I’ve seen all over the internet already. I could pay around $32 once for a digital journal and go browse Psychology Today and have the same thing as this app. Not to mention, there are spelling errors galore on here; I’d gladly offer my help for free. Oh wait—that would be dumb to help for free when you’re making $32 a month off people. People, there are cheaper/free apps. Good websites with good information for free. Use those instead.

Most of the tests are horribly worded and almost incomprehensibly vague (poor word choices and poor phrasing) - especially the personality tests. The courses also seem to be lacking - the information is very basic and you can only read one page of a given course per day. You could easily get all of the information at once from a two minute google search. 

Most importantly, though, the wording on their MDQ test is poorly done - the way they phrased the hypomania/mania questions aren’t as specific as the real MDQ, they just aren’t phrased in the right way at all. It’s like they didn’t understand what some of these questions are supposed to be looking for. They switch between past and present tense, and they made some of the qs sound like a weird personality quiz instead of asking about distinct, episodic symptoms. The real MDQ is not like this at all, and it really shouldn’t be hard to get the wording right considering how widely this (literally standardized) tool is used in professional settings. 

Additionally, the other tests on personality and temperament don’t leave any room for nuance or extenuating/influencing factors (like anxiety disorders, inattention due to ADHD, triggers from past traumas, current depressive or manic symptoms, medical illnesses, etc). These tests obviously aren’t serious diagnostic tools or anything but at least include limitations and a disclaimer of how other current conditions may skew results - it can be hard enough to separate your mental illness from your personality when you’re unwell, and letting your mental illness become your identity can have disastrous long term consequences.

On a lesser note, the emotional intelligence test is kinda buggy. There is no way to get a high empathy score because somehow the scoring is calculated wrong. I know how dumb this sounds, but I’m highly empathetic almost to a fault - I have a really hard time not taking on other people’s emotions, I’m the therapist friend/family member but also an emotional sponge. I can sympathize and understand the thought processes and reasons behind the emotional reactions of literally anyone, regardless of how irrational they may seem.

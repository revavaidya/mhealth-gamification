I always check out the All Trails reviews from other hikers before heading out, and usually find that other hikers have great insight/feedback about trail conditions. The only feature I don‚Äôt love about All Trails is the rating technique that is used for hiking trails. Trails are rated as either easy/moderate/hard and I have found through my experience that trails aren‚Äôt very consistently rated. I‚Äôve hiked some trails that were rated as hard and the hike felt easy. I‚Äôve hiked some rated as moderate and the hike felt hard. I understand that rating trails is a challenging component of hiking due to different levels of experience and fitness, however I would love to see an option where hikers who have completed the hike are able to submit their feedback on how challenging the hike was from 1-10. I think, overall, a 1-10 scale for how challenging a hike is would be extremely beneficial. Overall, I absolutely love All Trails and use the app daily!

Hiding it in the ‚Äú...‚Äù was worse, didn‚Äôt know it was there and my history is now not accurate, and now I have to make up a name for each recording on the fly.  Waste of time.  Please put check-in back where it belongs, it‚Äôs a critical feature, and right map loads with the name of the trail on the saved history. 
I also agree with the other user about trail hopping.  In New England many trails connect but are listed separately.  If you are no longer on the same one you started it appears you are just going rogue on the map.  How about auto loading the newly entered trail?
Also being able to edit history would be helpful. There‚Äôs been a couple times where I started driving home and forgot to hit pause and save.  And why the ‚Äúpause‚Äù button when the trail is complete?  It‚Äôs a weird way to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù or ‚Äúend hike‚Äù.

My only real issue, which caused my 4 star rating (which killed me to do so), is the fact that you CANNOT LAUNCH THE APP WITHOUT A CELLULAR OR WIFI CONNECTION!! It is ridiculous, plain and simple. I am a Pro subscriber to AllTrails. I did this solely so I could download trail maps prior to going in case I lost service on the trail. That feature works beautifully. But let‚Äôs say you download your map, head out to your trail, arrive and go to open app to use the map that is already saved on your phone. Guess what?? Unless you have service, you can‚Äôt open the app! So it‚Äôs essentially useless. The last thing I want to do is have to add ‚Äúopen AllTrails prior to leaving home‚Äù to my to do list to get ready. 
AllTrails, lets be real for a minute. Hiking, biking, exploring, etc. are all off the grid things! Chances are you won‚Äôt have service if you are in a remote location. Fix this issue!! Make an offline version of your app so that paid users who have already downloaded maps can actually use them!

Although, I have found 2 things, which need improvement : 1) I was recording my day hike and when I got back to my car, I wanted to save the hike, review it etc. But, there was no cell phone signal, which typically there isn‚Äôt, when you hike, so the application wouldn‚Äôt let me finish the process of saving/reviewing/adding comments.

But the application, was basically asking me, if I want to continue recording, if I said ‚Äúno‚Äù, the only choice it gave me, was to clear the data. Of course, I don‚Äôt want to add car drive to my hiking trip ...., 2) The other improvement is related to it. I think, if one is recording hiking trip and then forgets to save it, when gets back to car, the application should automatically detect, that obviously one is not hiking anymore, since the speed is > 10 miles/hour. It should then, ideally, ask you, if you want to make the car ride part of your recording or not.

So I wound up with a ~80mi hike the other day because it captured my entire drive for the day after I had thought I stopped the recording, and the walk itself was maybe half a mile.

The maps are detailed and accurate and the descriptions and directions are excellent. Over the years some great upgrades have been made, some of my favorites include being able to download tracks for offline use, marking distance and elevation along a specific track, and being able to create a map by selecting certain trails. 

There are still some frustrating faults with this app, however. For example, in order to record and keep a GPS recording a track a hike has to be part of an existing trail which can get annoying when I do infrequent or bushwhacking hikes. Having an option to keep tracks privately would be very helpful.

One upgrade I would love to see is the ability to edit or add to a track after I finish. Many times in the past I have forgotten to end a track and drove away, the result was an inaccurate GPS track. Also as the app currently is I can‚Äôt track multi-day trips, I can pause a track when I stop for lunch, but if I stop for the night my progress disappears.

The reason for 4 stars is that the program needs  several improvements 1) the trail creation features are not simple to access and use and can snap onto the wrong segment and can be problematic to close on loop trails for accurate distance measurement. 2) maps only print at specific ratios (not perfectly zoom customizable) so often trail is printed too small or large. I often have to split trail into 2-3 pages to get good detail. 3) the chosen route prints as a continuous red line and covers up the forest service trail numbers... forcing you to hand label printed maps with the #s if you are linking trails etc. Those deficiencies aside, AllTrails is an amazing tool to plan.

I personally am rarely on my computer so am unable to submit the edits, and I feel this is against good trail management practices because it encourages people to use trails that are closed to prevent erosion and overuse. In addition the trail names on the map are more often than not completely different from official trail names so in the event of an emergency that could cause some issues. 

My second issue is there is no way that I can find to flag inappropriate comments on a trail review. Saying a trail has been ‚Äú ruined by Mexican trash and their families‚Äù should be able to be flagged for deletion.

In the beginning it might have had issues but I think they are tied to performance issues of the phone and the network and satellite hardware.   I have been to many trails and it has worked great.   This new lifeline feature is going to be great especially for my wife since I usually hike alone.  It has helped me get back on the trail in areas where the trail is poorly marked or no real markings at all like out in West Texas. 

I took a turn off a trail ( not on purpose) thinking that was the trail.  It was the most dangerous turn possible.  I finally sat down and pulled out my phone and looked at my all trails plot.  I was way off but too dangerous to back track.  So I plotted a way across the steep mountain side to reconnect to the actual trail.

Other than that I have been using this app happily for about a year.  It has absolutely saved me from unplanned miles on poorly marked trail junctions.  It has helped me introduce people to hiking and backpacking.  I use it any time I am in a new place and can always find a trail, or a drive worth taking.

I use this app on every bike I take, weather that is an hour or a multi-day backpacking trip.    

It has REPLACED my need for a dedicated GPS device.   I don‚Äôt recommend it but honestly I don‚Äôt carry maps or books either, this has simply replaced them and that means saving weight (I mean always carry your map...lol)

I am a pro (paid) member and so long as the app continues to update and add new content I will continue to pay to use it.  

I don‚Äôt really understand people complaining about it not working without cellular coverage!  If you are going somewhere without cellular coverage you should be a pro member if for nothing else your own safety!!!!  You should have a downloaded map!   On top of that your phone can last for days on airplane mode with active GPS.  Compare the fee to any GPS device, map books, etc. and you will see you can pay to use this for years before approaching those prices.

2020-08-10 10:05:12,"First off, need to say i love this app and use it as a hiking bible!! Some recommendations I have for the developers:

Under reviews, show a user‚Äôs reputation score next to their name. It would be helpful to know if the person saying this trail is ‚Äúsoooo hard‚Äù is a complete noob to hiking or someone whose been on hundreds of trails, just for a frame of reference. Why have the reputation score if it isn‚Äôt displayed next to the usernames in the comments and reviews?

Also, while reading about the app it mentions you can upload edits to trails and routes. I can‚Äôt figure out how to do this on the app? There are many trails that the All Trails trail takes u into an unsafe area, and I would like to edit that for future users. I‚Äôve noticed the desktop has some features the mobile app doesn‚Äôt.... such as making ‚Äúlists‚Äù and creating new trails. 

Next, in addition to easy medium and hard.... add a safety ranking! Here on Oahu there are easy hikes that are super treacherous and then super hard hikes that are on huge pieces of land with nowhere to fall or get lost. For somewhere like Hawai‚Äôi this feature is very necessary. 

Finally, think there should be a DM (direct message) feature to make the app a bit more social! Or at least link to Instagram.

Most notably, It is not possible to place persistent point-of-interest pins on the map from the app. This means that you cannot mark your parking, campsite, cache etc before  you begin your hike.

2018-07-29 04:27:06,"This is a fantastic app and really useful for hiking. It would be a wholehearted recommendation if it wasn't for one problem I keep running into.

The main reason for buying the pro version is offline maps access. Most trails I do are not where data coverage is available. So offline maps are critical.

Hiwever, once downloaded, they just go away (expire?) within a day or so. This is incredibly frustrating given how much effort I took to slowly download these maps in poor data areas,only to find it magically disappeared before the hike. 

I can appreciate needing to refresh mapping data. But the app should never discard downloaded maps without user consent. I was in the Himalayas and it would take multiple days to download a map of a trek, only to see it disappear a day or to later.

Also the process of selecting a custom nap for offline download requires substantial data which makes it almost impossible to select in low bw areas. This is likely not an app problem, but if the selection UI can somehow use very low detail data to just select region, that would be great.

Mostly just please fix offline map expiry problem!",5,False,"Great app, one big problem in pro version",yet another hiker,,All Trails Hike Bike Run

1. Can‚Äôt set a default activity type. Every time I save a trail  I have to remember to change the activity from hiking to off road. I am usually tired and want to head straight home after a ride and want save the trail quickly.
2. Too many acknowledgements when taking a photo. Should take you to the photo app immediately. Should not ask you if you want to take a photo after you select photo.
3. Way, way too slow at startup. I usually start it up and find something else too do when I open the app. 
4. Wish directions feature would provide an alternate trail starting point when available. Entering a trail at original starting point can add a ridiculous amount travel time getting to the trail.
5. Zooming function is slow, recenter function is inconsistent, and tracking current drive is inconsistent. Sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt follow my drive after I recenter. Sometimes recenter retains the last zoom setting and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.

2018-01-20 22:09:39,"This should be a five star app. But there are two big problems holding it back.

1) Although it records your distance during hikes, it does not integrate with the Apple health app. So you do not get credit for any calories burned, or your distance traveled, unless you also use a second app to track those items at the same time. 

You shouldn‚Äôt have to use two apps to collect that data. The AllTrails app should be able to export that data into Apple Health for you.

2) The base app does not let you download any maps for off-line use.

That is a basic need of any hiking app, because most of the time when you are hiking in remote areas you do not have a cell phone signal. So the app does not work unless you can have an off-line map.

But the only way that AllTrails will let you have an off-line map, is if you subscribe to their yearly pro service for $20.

If you go on dozens of hikes a year, the subscription price is a fine value. But if you only go on one or two hikes year, this one price fits all mentality is too much.

It will say your trail is nowhere near you, and trails nowhere near you are the ones ‚Äúnearest you‚Äù when they aren‚Äôt. So you have to refresh over and over to get it right.",5,False,Only issue is Location.,Cardsfan2006,,All Trails Hike Bike Run

However, I've now had drafts of trail reviews disappear when I jump from writing the review to, for instance, reassigning the linked trail.

Seems like in an app with such a robust feature set, auto save would be a no-brainer. I will rewrite my reviews in Apple Notes and paste into AllTrails for now.",3,False,Please auto save drafts of reviews,jstilly,"{'id': 9635586, 'body': ""Hi there - thanks a ton for the feedback and sorry for the trouble you are having with the app reviews.

2. Stop resetting the map/screen thats loaded. If the app is closed or loses focus to another app, it resets. Stop resetting. Record the last loaded screen and stay there on that screen. UI basics 101 the alltrails dev team doesnt seem to understand. Stop resetting the screen the app was last on. I dont know what triggers it but it seems to be a loss of lte signal. That shouldn‚Äôt be a reason to reset. We‚Äôre in the wilderness. The outback. The sketchy signal areas.",1,False,How to make it better:,Ike Leland,"{'id': 8764862, 'body': ""Hey Ike - thanks a ton for the feedback. There was a bug in our last release that caused the trail data to re-initialize on every app open. Annoying, we know. We've fixed that, and if you haven't already please update to the latest version. To your second point, we hear you loud and clear but more often than not that issue is caused by the operating system trying to conserve memory which means we have very little control over that experience. We'll keep investigating how to improve the overall experience, especially in the backcountry, and in the meantime please know that we read all of these comments and use them to improve our product. Anytime you have a suggestion for us, please don't hesitate to email support@alltrails.com."", 'modified': '2019-05-20T20:54:45Z'}",All Trails Hike Bike Run

You do NOT have to share your data with Sweat Coins, they just ask. So I‚Äôm not sure what made people give them a bad review because overall the app does what it says it will do!

My iPhone counted 11k steps in one day, Sweatcpins registered 4K.... 
the idea of the app is awesome to inventive people to stay moving, but you (developers) should be a bit more in tune with whatever app you request access to on our phones.

I could literally see the steps ticking up in the app during this time, and before the boost ended, I had over 2000 steps in. Then, when the boost was complete and the steps were ‚Äúcalculated‚Äù, the app told me that I had somehow taken a measly 356 steps in that time! SECONDS before, it said I had taken 2000+. My Apple Watch and phone also said that I had taken over 2000 steps, and once I exited out of the boost, my total steps had increased by over 2000 as well.

Most of them fall into health and fitness categories, which I don‚Äôt mind it would just be nice to have a bit more variety.

Please don‚Äôt buy coupons on this app, I promise you can get almost all of them from a different source without having to pay anything for them. A quick Google search will find the same coupon. I did that frequently and saved my sweat coins. I only was able to buy on thing with my sweat coins that I was interested in. In the end I ended up paying about $20 in shipping for the item.

Me being young and not really paying attention I thought nothing was wrong about this app. Although it says that it pays you for your steps and for the daily exercise it gives you cause of quarantine, it doesn‚Äôt pay in cash. I know most apps don‚Äôt pay in cash but they go onto a credit card or a prize, but I‚Äôve been looking and can‚Äôt seem to find how to add a card to the app to transfer the money I make to the card. I‚Äôve seen that what you make goes as credits to gas and shopping. People downloaded this app and walk and stay fit to make money but not understanding that what you make might not even be very helpful for when you want to go online shopping or going to grab a lunch. Another problem I‚Äôve noticed was that you can walk 1,000 steps for example and it would only count about 200 of the steps you took, which drops down the cents you could have made accurately. I‚Äôve talked to my mom about this and we‚Äôve both agreed that it was a scam and that it was a waist of time. I personally think that this app shouldn‚Äôt be downloaded and should be deleted if already downloaded.

You think you‚Äôre earning free money just by walking around outside, but here‚Äôs the catch; the items you can purchase with your Sweatcoins still demand some of your own money for shipping, membership, etc. and you end up getting sucked into something you thought was a good deal, but I‚Äôve checked multiple times and they probably save you only $2 at most.
I‚Äôve read soooo many reviews saying that Sweatcoin ripped them off after they had already spent their unfairly earned coins for ‚Äúprizes‚Äù and when they tried to fix the problem with Customer Service, they never picked up, never returned phone calls, kept getting transferred to person after person, you name it. (I don‚Äôt say unfairly earned lightly, you could participate in 5 marathons in a day and they would only give you about $2 worth of coins) Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt experience this first hand because I was saving my coins for the ultimate price; $1,000.

Inside the marketplace, all you can ever buy are discounts for actual products. For example, pay 50 sweatcoins to earn a 34% discount on a shaver kit or pay 10 sweatcoins to earn $3 off your first purchase in a restaurant or some crap like that. YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BUY A PRODUCT! If they ever do have giftcards, they are only available through sweepstakes, which you never win. Even if you pay to become a premium member, you still have no options to buy a physical item or giftcard with your own money!

1. Please implement an ‚Äúabort‚Äù option for the 2X Boost, because sometimes it just gets stuck on ‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Äù forever. The problem is, when I start the boost at the beginning of my walk, it doesn‚Äôt update the rest of the steps due to this bug, and gives me 0 step. Very fristrating.

2. Please do a good job of reviewing your make partners‚Äô (sponsors) ads.

3. Please make sure that your ads don‚Äôt get stuck while loading. This happens at least 2-3 times a week and it‚Äôs very frustrating. After waiting for a while, I force close the app and restart and usually it will work fine, but sometimes it takes numerous tries.

 Take for instance the $1000 PayPal credit. In order to obtain this reward, you must allocate 20,000 sweatcoins. 1,000 steps equals 1 sweatcoin, however the app has a cap of 5 sweatcoins per day (and to increase the cap, you need to pay monthly payments).

I'm after the big prizes, so I don't spend my coins on the promos in the market unless it's something I know will be useful (like a free month of Calm). I do think some of their promos are really interesting, though. 

I LOVE that sweatcoin now has crowdfunding campaigns that I can donate my coins to. I get extra coins for doing the daily ad bonus, so I will now donate most of those. I think I like donating to these causes more than I like saving coins for a big prize. It feels good to help other people.

My only issue with the app is that it does not accurately track my steps. I regularly take 2-mile walks, but sweatcoin often counts 2/3 my steps or less. I know because I compare to other health apps that all show the full distance of my walk. I would like this app to count all my steps so I can earn & donate more coins. 

I have a suggestion for the developers: it would be awesome to let sweatcoin track my steps when I go to the gym. Perhaps you could use the GPS to have location-specific check-ins at gyms all over the country.

I walk daily 3-4 miles also adding in my steps for just normal day to day activities I average around 10-11,000 steps. The app only counted 2,000 of them as actual steps. The algorithm is awful. The developers most common response is to update the app. Obviously the updated version has not corrected that problem at all. 2nd, the purchase items are not at all for only coins earned but also requires actual cash for shipping that is way overpriced. And lastly. Any decent rewards are offered through challenges that is nearly impossible to reach within the time frame.

I‚Äôve had this app for about 2 years now and have 700 sweatcoins. For reference, every 1,000 steps you take, you earn 1 sweatcoin. This means this app has logged about 700,000 of my steps.

Practically every ‚Äúreward‚Äù is a subscription service to some start-up brand that no one really wants.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I‚Äôve been a Sweatcoin user for over 2 years. I‚Äôm not a huge walker, but I‚Äôd get at least a few thousand steps in a day and they‚Äôd covert to a handful of coins. I had collected almost 900 coins and was just waiting for something that really wanted to shop up in the offers.

Back in December, I did the update that was supposed to add counting indoor steps. Since that update, I‚Äôve converted ZERO steps. Literally ZERO. And with the current quarantine, I‚Äôve actually been going out of walks multiple times a week (today I just did over 2 miles and counted almost 5000 steps). The app converted ZERO.

I‚Äôve tried all the suggestions: turn background refresh off and then back on, uninstalled and reinstalled, don‚Äôt use low power mode, etc. Still literally ZERO coins.

I keep hoping one of the updates fixes whatever the problem is, but nothing. I‚Äôm on the verge of just deleting the app since there is literally ZERO reason to use it. This is my last effort to try and get a fix.",1,False,RyGuyLB,New update ruined the app,Sweatcoin Walking Step Counter

Any of the rewards worth shooting for would require 2 years or more of 20k verified steps per day, if they are even still available once you amass the coins.  Most ‚Äúrewards‚Äù are like 5 coins for a one month trial of some app, and you can get a free one month trial anywhere.

The indoor tracking is a nice idea, but you are relying on your iPhone step counter, which misses most indoor steps anyway.  Yesterday, my Fitbit recorded 5k steps around the office, but iPhone only recognized 1k, and sweat coin only verified about 300.

I've had the app for almost a year. According to the description in the item page, ""with 10,000 a day"" goal

I should have close to 3000 coins, if not more. 700 coins is far from the expected total for a year.

I've had the app for quite a while now, (I even had the upgrade to the higher level) hoping they would come up with a good algorithm to stop the cheating, but it's just been getting worse. A couple of updates ago I thought it was getting better, a couple times I hit the max and was actually loosing coins because I needed to upgrade. But it wasn't constant.

I've used this app since it first came out and have only been able to accumulate around 2,500 coins.

Most only consist of coupons and cheap products with a $10 shipping fee.

Since it's release, the price of Sweatcoin has plummeted and has little chance to get listed on the blockchain so needless to say, you aren't getting any money out of this unless paying for coupons is your thing. The hype is long gone and so are its ""glory days"".

Once there's a good enough offer to spend all my coins on, this app will no longer be on my phone. If it just continues to get worse, I'll have no choice but to donate them.

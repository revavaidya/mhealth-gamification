PurePulse LEDs (light-emitting diodes) on your Fitbit device reflect onto the skin to detect blood volume changes, and finely-tuned algorithms are applied to measure heart rate automatically and continuously. The heart-rate icon you see on the display tells you if you're in 1 of 3 heart-rate zones.\n\n \n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're doing an activity where your wrist is moving vigorously and non-rhythmically, the movement may prevent the sensor from finding your heart rate. If this happens, try relaxing your wrist and staying still briefly (about 10 seconds), after which you should see an accurate heart rate reading. For more on what impacts heart rate accuracy, please see: http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1565#ImpactsAccuracy. \n\n \n\nHope you'll also like the other features your watch has to offer! \n\n \n\nBest,\n\nFitbit Support"", 'modified': '2019-03-24T15:05:49Z'}","I am absolutely hooked on my Fitbit! I bought the Charge 3 and I hate taking it off. I love the notifications it sends if I haven’t moved from my desk each hour, I love the fact you can challenge other friends and colleagues to weekend, or weekly challenges as well as track your own performance. It’s got me more motivated than any exercise book, or personal trainer. The only downside I find is that it’s not 100% accurate. My resting heart rate on an ECG machine compared to my Fitbit has a difference of 10 beats per minute...that’s a big number when you’re trying to work in fat burn mode or/and cardio. In addition, when I train with other people my steps are pretty much the same but when we e all walked a 12km walk (as we’ve done consistently this week), my Fitbit comes up with almost 2km less than the others! The only time it’s accurate is if I walk with my GPS on my phone and then sync the data after my walk/run. In addition the calorie counter has very limited good options and scanning them and sending them off is too time consuming. I find I’m using the “My Fitnesspal” app to monitor my food intake...please look at their app and try and make the Fitbit calorie counter more user friendly. Apologies for mentioning the bits that need “tweaking”,  but it’s constructive feedback that I feel is important. All in all I am so chuffed that I have a Fitbit as its now become a way of life for me!

I am a volleyball player and I always have my Fitbit on. The app has been a tremendous help through the years and actually helped save my life twice when my heart rate was notably out of control and though I had been feeling very sick, it wasn’t until I saw that that I told my husband to get me to the hospital. Saved me from going into septic shock so that was cool. The app has also helped me with tracking calories, weight goals, periods, fertility, sleep, and more. The app actually helped us get pregnant with our first child (I have PCOS and was having a difficult time but the app really helped me figure out timing and consult a physician about the trends). What I’m saying is, I would recommend the Fitbit app and best Fitbit watches over pretty much every other product I have seen that is similar. Yes, even the A***e Watch and whatever new thing G****e has come out with. Best bang for your buck and there are a lot of apps that link up with the Fitbit app (and products) to improve your experience and help you meet your goals.

Update with 5 stars to go with it:  I was so surprised that the developers responded to the problem I posted about syncing, and for that alone, I’d give the app 5 stars for customer service. But better yet, the FitBit help page that they directed me to had the solution. It was at end of webpage after a long list of things to try, most of which everyone probably does. At the end of the “try this” suggestions, the one about how to reset the actual tracker did the trick. I never knew there was a little button on the charger itself for this purpose. Anyways, my Flex 2 tracker miraculously synced after I reset it, and it had stored a full week of data, exercise, sleep patterns, etc, which appeared happily in the app.   The developer’s reply to my initial review has the link to follow for how-to.

Since the different information all looks to be nearly the same color now, it’s not as quick or easy to scroll through and check different metrics at a glance like I could do before. Some info has been completely removed, like the remaining battery life on my device, or the predicted total number of calories left for the day that used to be visible on the main page. And the new graphics feel excessively large, while the important aspects of them (like the icon to show you’ve reached your goal in a category) are humorously miniature in comparison. Not only that, but chronic bugs remain unfixed and unaddressed, like how the app freezes when trying to open the barcode scanner to enter a food item of that is the first thing you try to do after opening the app; or how, when viewing the “zone minutes” section, if you have logged exercise for the day, the heart rate data shows an artifactual massive spike in heart rate around 12-1am (and this spike only generates/appears after exercise has been logged, and is only shown in that section of the app- there is no corresponding HR spike when viewing the general heart rate data).

I had been using different apps for diet and, although I was maintaining weight, I wasn't losing. In May 2014, I decided to put all my activity and diet into one program. I compared a few and ended up with the Fitbit program. By September 2014, I had lost 20 pounds. A miracle as far as I'm concerrned after so many years of trying. Most important, I feel healthier. I recently changed to the Fitbit One as a tool for my next goal....the next 10 pounds and to help me with my sleep cycle, which I have found to be amazing. The best thing out of all of this is that all the tools are together, complete with trends, journal, archives, and incentives. I have read some of the other reviews and find that one-dimensional observations of a multi-dimensional program lack the information and experience needed to be fair. If you buy a product knowing that it does not link with an app you are using, why buy it? Because the product, even as a stand alone, is good.

The categories are broken down to only a few, at most, and the search feature isn’t really all that reliable for what you’re truly trying to search for. For example, when searching for “beach” it only shows a few options, but IF you have a large amount of free time to search through the extensive library one by one, you happen to come across several more while browsing. Maybe having a “tag” feature for clock face developers to add search keywords would be nice. It would also be nice if there was a feature to filter clock faces by which ones are free from those that you have to buy.

I’m also not fond of the calorie link option that FitBit incorporates with the MyFitnessPal app. It would be nice for a setting to be provided to select whether you only want workout calories that you’ve burned to automatically link to your MyFitnessPal app versus your overall calorie burn for the day. I’m one who only likes to log my calorie burn for workouts and not the entire day. 

Those are overall my only two complaints.

I kept up with my exercise needs and intensity by monitoring the type of exercise and length ing my workouts. It helps that Fit bit is waterproof because I like water aerobics. The  FitBit also accounts for numerous of steps walked per day. Many people aspire to 10,000 steps per day but as a 75 year old sedentary woman who was overweight and hated exercise, I chose to start at 3,000 steps. Of course, that goal could be raised, but I pretty much stayed at that goal. Through diet and better choices in food, activities, and better sleep hygiene, I was able to go from 338 pounds down to 206, my goal for my tall, large framed body. I’ve managed to keep my weight within 206 and 211 for over a year. This success is attributed to my acceptance of the understanding that calories in equals exercise out. It is NOT easy but I am glad I did. Good luck to you and you might like to try a FitBit to help your progress.

The only solutions offered are to update the phone IOS or the watch app. Both of which are updated, and I don’t seem to have an option to do a manual update. Seeing all the forums of people with these issues that Fitbit has done nothing to help out with is a poor display from the company that I used to really love. People keep having problems and the company says nothing for months to a year, but they have time to send out an email saying they’ve been bought by google ? Really disappointed in how this company seems to have gone downhill in quality of their customer service and how well their products work. I can’t buy a pricey watch because when trying out Versas they won’t read through my tattoos.

I switched back to Fitbit 3 months ago and, again, I love the info and reports (I do miss the up/down flights of stairs info), but my watch is already having trouble. I may have to have it replaced.

I have no desire to even open the app anymore. It is not appealing at all. The old dashboard style was WONDERFUL — you could open the app up and instantly view your stats in each little box without having to open each individual tile up, the card style was extremely visually appealing and fun to use, the fonts and colors were great. Now, the app is a major turn off with its new list view, small and uninviting font, and the stat previews are unfamiliar and no longer easy to understand. I am always open to change and updates but this new app style is definitely not a good one... especially when there are thousands of others complaining of the same thing. Fitbit, I hope you can incorporate a different app design similar to the old one, or I think you’ll be losing a lotttt of customers. The old dashboard design was one of the most appealing things to me as a Fitbit user and I used to be excited to check it every day. Now I can’t stand it. :( Please have your design team look into this. I know that apps must always be streamlined and keep up with updated design styles, but there are ways to keep the old basics (card style, bright colors, large fun font and lots of icons) while still making it look fresh and new. Please consider this. All of us at the Fitbit community will greatly appreciate this!",1,False,Kate.151922,New App Design Turning Customers Away!!,Fitbit Health Fitness

I loved that my history from my old Fitbit was there because it gave me motivation to get back to how I used to be. 

Now the stuff I didn't like. 
I wish the messages would be more of a messenger style. I can't go back and look at the conversation as a whole, all I can see are messages sent to me and it's all separate so it clogs up the message list. Would be much better to see the whole convo in one message so I can have proof of incidents like I just had. I have friended a few people from the different communities in the app. So far everyone is cool, we are all there for fitness and support. I recently accepted a friend request and the guy started messaging me. It started out innocent enough just talking about how long we have had a Fitbit and what our fitness goals are. Then he started getting weird and talking about my face based off my profile picture and started hinting at sexual intentions. I ended up unfriending him and blocking him. What I wish for this app is a way to report users like this. This isn't a dating/hook up app!

There is no setting in the app or website to set it to buzz once only. I had to turn all notifications off completely because you have no control over what it notifies you about or how many notifications you get.

This morning, knowing I had a long, challenging day ahead, I saw that my sleep had been given an arbitrary 70-something score which I cannot remove to just view the actual data. It’s on every screen.

The interface on that has been horrible since they added it and I get frustrated EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to edit my period dates. The whole “drag the bar to fine tune your start and end dates” is annoying and does not respond well at all. It often gets stuck on one day and no matter what I do I cannot move it. Or I can’t get it to stop on the day I want. Why can’t we just select the dates manually without having to drag a bar? Also sometimes periods are irregular and maybe last a day or two and then go away for a day or two and come back, but the way this app does it currently is that you cannot add two separate periods in one month. You can only add the one so you cannot get it to display accurately at all. Make it so you can manually select each day and put in whether or not your period was on that day. I use Flow for my main period tracking since that app is dedicated to that and a million times better but I’d also like to track it in my Fitbit app since that’s where all my other health data is stored.

About a year ago my wife bought me one not knowing my distain for the company. I thought perhaps they’ve fixed their poorly made device problem. Boy was I wrong. Went through one, it broke. They gave me a warranty replacement. I chose to use it for a minimalist model hoping I’d see better results. Well, this one had countless internal problems. When I set an alarm, it would go off 14 minutes exactly after the set time. I spent countless hours with support. They ask you to do the same three things - check if your phone is updated, reinstall the app and re-sync the device. At best that solution would work for 3 days. I then spent over 3 months emailing support back and forth. Tho the ticket was submitted before the warranty expired, they said that although they agreed it was worth a warranty replacement, my warranty had expired a month prior. 

The fact that their only business is making wearable devices and they only offer a 1 year warranty should tell you something — they make them to break, so you have to keep buying more.

That worked and of course I paid for the Fitbit within weeks! I now monitor my steps daily and find its pretty accurate. I have noticed that the distance is always off substantially (am guessing maybe I could set the step distance to correct that but haven’t bothered.) I love the challenges and connect with family and friends across the globe on a daily basis as we motivate each other to move. I’ve even gifted multiple Fitbits to include some of my loved ones. My only gripe is that within the challenges, the comments have been incomplete for quite some time. I keep waiting for one of the updates to fix the error, but months later I am motivated to write this (seeing that many comments get a reply. 🙂) To be clear, the wording such as ‘That step goal was no match for...’ is often cut off so that I can’t see the persons name.

However, the recent update in early July had major bugs introduced to the food log.  The app was updated within a week to address the bugs in the roll out.  I am now happier with the product and reaction time it took FitBit to address the problems.

I do wish they had a more clear way to offer feedback, suggestions, and requests.  For example, one sometime may mid-enter food nutrition data (I have done this by accident as well as having run across obviously erroneous entries).  Currently there is no clear method to report these aberrations so the log can be cleaned up.  Another example is the recent roll out of Female Health Information that can show up on your dashboard.

It’s one of the first things I check in the morning to see how I slept. It’s really easy to use and encouraging to see all the numbers change.  The only thing this app is missing (and which I have to use another app for which is SUPER annoying) is the ability to create custom recipes so I can accurately put in dinner. Currently I have to put everything in by hand which isn’t the worst except I always have leftovers do I have to divide the recipe by thirds or something. It’d be a lot easier if I could just enter it once and say the serving size. It’d also be a lot easier if you could copy one meal from one day and place the same exact meal in another. This goes back to the leftover thing because if I make a complex dish, I have to remember everything I put in it for multiple days (thinking about the math) and it’s vaguely irritating. I also think that you should be able to track your macros more efficiently. The percentages are great and everything but they seem a bit useless if you’re actually trying to measure your protein or carb intake.

I’m still using the charge 2 with heart rate and i use it every si for day. If I ever forget it I feel lost or “naked” as others would say. It’s tracks my sleep witch I need a lot a lot of help with, shows my texts and my calls although the ONE THING I wish we could have is more clock face options. I like my girlie faces but I like to see the date and day with my time and those faces are...well...a little boring I guess? So yes definitely more clock faces. 
I like using Fitbit . I started with the basic and now up to the charge 2 I bought like 3 days ago. I am having a problem with reviewing notification on my Fitbit. I updated the app all my notifications are on. I’ve deleted the app for bit and synced again I disconnected Bluetooth. All of that. It was working the first two days and then last night and today I get zero notifications 
I’ve even missed messages from my boss yikes! So maybe it’s just a bug or is it just me?

I love the tracking capability of the app when it comes to counting and keeping track of calories consumed, and also for tracking water intake. This was a key factor in my loss of nearly 40 lbs between Feb and April 2021. Since then, I have easily kept the weight off due to constant vigilance. I weigh myself every single day and I put the weight and body fat percentage into my Fitbit app. This feature, too, has been a wonderful tool on my road to fitness and good health. I use the timer function in my Fitbit Charge 5 during exercise, when I’m cooking, when I’m reading, when I wear my YogaToes, when I do planks.

Besides the step count and heart rate measurements, my favorite features are the silent alarms and sleep functions. Fitbit tracks your sleep and even the specific stages of sleep. Additionally, their silent alarms feature has made getting up in the mornings easier. It wakes me up better than a sound alarm plus it doesn’t bother my partner in the mornings. 

Recently, fitbit updated the app, changes the appearance of the dashboard. It is a stylish new update, but takes up more space than the previous version. Before, you could easily look at your stats at a glance. However, the update requires you to scroll quite a bit to see everything. 

In addition, the update has made it more difficult to set the silent alarms. Instead of being able to add it from the main page, users now have to navigate to the account page, then the fitbit settings, and then finally access the silent alarms. This process makes changing the settings more circuitous.

I love my FitBit, and I have found the app to be flexible, efficient and helpful in meeting my fitness goals. But just this week, I was forced into the new app with no warning. The main screen looks completely different, and all of my personalization disappeared, so I had to start from scratch. I didn’t want a “daily focus”, so I had to dig around until I found a custom setting to put what I want at the top of the main page. Then, for the rest of the stats, the only personalization they have is whether you want it displayed or not. I used to be able to move each statistic around, but now they only move in chunks by category. (For example, I want heart rate higher on the home screen, but I have no way to move it within its larger category.) It also takes more selections to get to certain data, making the app more cumbersome than helpful. 

The thing that bothers me the most though is that my step streak has completely disappeared. Seeing a count of how many days in a row I got 10,000 steps has been the main motivating factor for using FitBit, and now I don’t have it.

The other features of the device and of the application are ok. They are comparable to other devices that are far less expensive and to some that are more. Neither the physical device or the software are particularly attractive. Both are functional and nearly childish in appearance and performance. Since it consistently informs users that it is not a medical device and the telemetry data is not medically reliable, then FITBIT must be a toy. Because, an unreliable sensor is useless. 
So, if you already bought a Fitbit device, you will have to download the software to run it. If you are considering a Fitbit device, it’s no better or worse than other fitness devices.

After this amount of time I’m not sure if they are evaluating this at all so it’s likely I will return it. I didn’t need another watch to look at, I needed a fitness monitoring device that’s easy to read. 

 I can’t speak for other models of Fitbit but as for the Inspire HR the heart rate display is too small and highly overshadowed by the large time display and the app doesn’t contain a larger option for that piece of data. The display options in the app seem to focus more on the time or animal faces and icons vs one of the main reasons to purchase the HR version. Hopefully a future update will contain at least a 50/50 clock to heart rate screen display ratio version for the data or a way to keep a particular metric on the screen that’s big enough to see when running for example. Other than the hard to read backwards graphics design the app and product are awesome. However If you want to quickly and effectively monitor critical data at a glance that is more important to you than the time of day,  this isn’t the one.

It would be great if Fitbit offered fall detection and notification with GPS coordinates to selected emergency contacts as well as an SOS option that would also notify contacts and bring up the option of dialing 911.

My one complaint is that my band broke at the first loop within a couple weeks. I don’t wear it tight (I can slide it around, up, and down my wrist) but not so loose that it’s flopping around (that would cause the heart rate monitor to not work accurately).

The meal tracking also doesn’t work lately. I’ll find the correct food and hit save then it glitches an logs a completely different food if it logs anything at all. Fitbit notes that they know there’s a problem and they’re investigating but considering I like to log all my food to pay attention to caloric intake and macros, it’s really annoying when it doesn’t work.

All the food I had logged wouldn’t appear, calories I KNOW I had consumed would magically disappear, thousands of calories and foods I hadn’t logged would be added mysteriously, etc. Not only have I had to deal with this plague, which has increased in frequency, but for whatever reason, you guys recently decided to take away the extensive macronutrient breakdown. I can no longer see how much sugar I have consumed, how much fiber I’ve consumed, and how much sodium I intake every day.

Now the new app has changed to this ugly list layout where you have to scroll and click to find the things you used to be able to see and understand clearly with on glance. I feel so sad now when i open my app. It seems like I am not the only one who hates this new version. Ive seen lots of other reviews who complain about the same thing. The old version was good, perfect actually. I dont understand why they would revert to an archaic design that looks like it was designed by an amateur 🤢 Plus i dont appreciate that the Fitbit company is dismissing its customers complaints and refusing to change back or give us an option to choose which dashboard we want. PLEASE Fitbit bring back the old design, it was what made your company stand above the rest 🙏🏼 It was the reason why i stuck with you guys instead of getting an Apple Watch or Garmin.

    I started using this as a skeptic but really use this. Note I'm reviewing the app here , not my Versa that I'm also happy with.  In particular I am amazed at the detail in the sleep, showing light, REM, deep & awake during the night. Are these accurate? I don't care because I compare days to guide me. I doubted the accuracy of the heart monitor, too, until I compared it against my Polar heart monitor I use for exercising. The Fitbit was exactly the same. 
      I have used a separate app to track my exercise for years, so the exercise part is of little interest to me.  
      I  like how customizable this app is. One can add or drop modules as well as the placement of the modules which makes it very useful. I find myself checking this several times/ day.

No idea why, after 7 years of their work they have not thought of this yet. They could have also integrated a simply measure of the healthiness of the diet (again from myfitnesspal app). Up! Used to have this was so helpful to monitor not just calories by how healthy my diet for the day was, all on one app and dashboard. Now, I have to open this app for calories burnt, open fitness pal for calories Wayne and heath of diet, and manually subtract the burnt and eaten calories.

I’ve been willing to overlook some inaccuracies in tracking my running/walking, but I can’t overlook the fact that in the 2 years since I got my Versa I’ve had the sensor die (or some other malfunction) after about 6 months. This most recent time is after installing the new firmware last night; it paused in the middle of doing that and poof, couldn’t get it to do anything(through it apparently is still tracking my sleep).

 At the hardest level, the calories intake was around ‘856.’ This is very concerning! That doesn’t sound healthy at all. I don’t know how you specifically calculate it but that is definitely not enough calories to function properly on. And who wants to have 856 calories for the rest of their life?

2023-09-27 02:33:28,,I purchased my first Fitbit in 2014 and have mostly enjoyed my experience with the fitness trackers I’ve purchased. I maintained that loyalty as everyone in my circle that utilized fitness trackers moved to Apple Watch. I’ve never been a supporter of Google and was very disappointed when it was announced Google was purchasing Fitbit. I considered making the switch to Apple Watch as I felt confident Google would ultimately destroy what I considered to be a good product up to that point. I hesitated b/c Fitbits battery life and app were superior to what Apple provided in my opinion. This latest app update and the news surrounding future changes for Fitbit users has changed my view. This update does not simplify the app but clutters my screen with info I don’t want to see and makes it confusing to reconfigure my screen to show the stats I’m most interested in. It seems clear Google has clear intentions to minimize original Fitbit products and promote their own. If I have to choose b/t adjusting to the products Google wants to deliver to the public and what I’ve enjoyed from Fitbit my choice will be to make that adjustment with an Apple Watch.,1,False,Da Cart,Google Fitbit app update,Fitbit Health Fitness

I say this because I drove to the local Walgreen’s a week ago, and it registered my drive as actual “exercise” activity. On the other hand, the HealthKit app has been able to keep track of all my activity very, very accurately.

I have a Versa and I love it! My husband bought me the Apple Watch and I returned it after trying it for a week. My Fitbit Versa goes everything I want and is easy to use. The charge on it lasts at least 5 days, usually a week for me! The accuracy on the step count is about 10-15% less than a stepcounter that you would wear on your waist, but often I am on my phone, holding it up with  the hand I wear my Fitbit on. However, my Fitbit Versa was far more accurate than the Apple Watch I tried, even after calibrating the Apple.

The only thing that I wish it had was GPS. That is the reason I tried the Apple Watch in the first place. But it ended up that I still liked the verse some more. My husband has the Fitbit watch that has the GPS on that, but that’s way too huge for my small wrist. 
One more thing that’s better about the versa than the Apple Watch is the size of it and how nicely it feels on my wrist. The Apple Watch has a rounded back that felt awkward and its charge couldn’t last 24 hours. Not helpful if you’re trying to track sleep. Or if you don’t want to plug it in every night.

The trend line is  helpful to follow over time, and has enabled me identify patterns for seasons of the year I typically gain weight. For example, I was surprised to notice that Springtime was a season I’d typically gained weight. Seeing this pattern on the trend line helped me better understand and think about what influences my weight. I am a visual person, so I understand the whole story better that way.

I also value the sleep data each morning, and can visually see how my lifestyle choices and evening routines affect the quality of my sleep. 

I’ve tracked my weight and sleep with pencil and paper and spreadsheets for many years, but the Fitbit provides so much more insight than just the numbers alone can provide, particularly by showing how much deep, REM, restless, and light sleep I’m getting each night.

Next we bought Aria 2 but could not get both of our devices to connect with the new scale. After several failed attempts in which one but not both would sync we returned the scale and now own a 3rd party product. It was less expensive and seems to work well.

Makes me question all data from my Fitbit.  I think it is time for this loyal customer to switch to a competitor who is better at software & algorithms! 

App has gone down hill.  Sleep score is nonsense & Sleep algorithm is a fail - it tacks on awake time after you wake up every single day!  If you edit it, it mangles the rest of your sleep data.  
Woke up at 8:11 with 6h32m of sleep, but the app makes it 8:17....  ok, I can edit that awake time off, right?  Well not quite, by subtracting 6 minutes awake time (via edit sleep log option) the algorithm somehow makes my sleep time go to 6h23m & my awake time instead increases from 37 to 40 minutes!

One thing FitBit needs to change is it continually request that I turn on GPS to improve tracking which is really annoying. I do not want it turned on all the time and selectively turn it on when I ride a bike or go running (app used to work this way until recently). There should be an option NOT to prompt turning on GPS tracking which I find it REALLY ANNOYING.  This would have been a 5 star review except for the continued prompting to turn on GPS tracking.

The UI has lost most customization options for which goals are most important or even your total steps for the week. No trophies or challenges has resulted in me rarely opening the app, when I used to open it several times a day.

So for example, if I enter a particular Trader Joe’s bread by scanning the barcode but don’t remember later what it’s called or when I last ate it, there’s no easy way for me to find it if I don’t have the package in front of me (to either search or scan).

Most of the time, I click on a section to check the details and a different section opens. It isn’t syncing properly. They’ve tried to cram so much on the home screen that everything is tiny.

4. Silent alarms: THIS is my favorite function! The ability to set, turn on and turn off alarms without my phone around or when I’m out of cell range is huge! I’m a backpacker. Old versions of Fitbit relied on your phone having connectivity to service to change the alarm function on the tracker. Now, this capability is all on the watch itself! The silent vibration is just enough to wake me and not disturb others around me. Up to eight alarms can be set as reminders throughout the day. 
5. Battery life: My tracker is almost two years old.  The battery keeps going for a little over four days, sometimes five if I don’t have a lot of alerts incoming.

Unfortunately, FitBit decided to take away the most important feature which was averages of sleep for the week. Now we get “sleep scores” which are not at all explained as to how they are determined and are just random numbers. Some nights if the FitBit doesn’t track heat rate then there is no sleep score. So average of how week I sleep that week is inconsistent and basically mean jack squat. I don’t understand Fit Bit took away and made it a premium feature to see amount of time I sleep for each night and the average for the week. It’s absolutely asinine. With them stripping away the useful features and then asking me to pay for them to get them back as well as being sold to Google, I’m no longer the FitBit fan I was. With the holidays coming up, it may be time to switch to a different wearable with better sleep tracking. FitBit blew it and it’s their own greed and pettiness that did it.

I can get a maximum in of 7 hours, and it’s still rating me as average-poor sleep quality. Most adults try to get adequate sleep, so I’m curious how it’s gauging what enough sleep is. Anyways, being able to only see a score can make you subconsciously feel like you haven’t gotten enough sleep and can actually increase your stress levels. Again, I love Fitbit because it shows me what I’m doing right, and pushes me to do better. However, rating sleep goes a little too far. I think there will be ill effects to grading someone’s sleep.

I was so excited for how pretty it was and had more features, but I’ve been disappointed in the Fitbit itself and I’ve contacted Fitbit.   But the app has been a huge disappointment lately.  In challenges with friends it doesn’t read my steps.  This week for example you go through and add the steps daily I’m at 63,000.  The challenge I’m in says I’m only at 47,000.  I went on a 5,000 step walk tonight and it read 500 of those on the challenge.  This isn’t the first time that this has happened either.  So one of my fave things about having a Fitbit is not up to par.  The app also doesn’t get my active hours.  Today for example the app says I have been active 4/13 hours.

Second issue: Vibration Weakness
The vibration on both Inspire HR and 2, some Charges, and some Versas are too weak! The non-watch trackers have no way to adjust. Please make the vibration range bigger so it can be customized! I don’t know if this can be an app feature, but you should include this for ALL Fitbit products.

Additionally, don’t break a sweat while exercising or it will stop tracking your heart rate. This has been an issue off and on for me and I’ve had 3 different Fitbit devices over the years.

And the app is fairly intuitive and satisfies me in most areas. One area I really would like to see a change in is the food entry section.

 When entering food items singularly it is more or less satisfactory, however because I do a lot of cooking (using many fresh ingredients and not just purchased items with nutritional info) it becomes cumbersome. Many similar food tracking apps allow you to enter customizable recipes which allows ease of both frequenting that recipe and also using many mass ingredients and then dividing the nutritional information down by the portion size. The fact that I can’t find this function in the Fitbit food tracker is a BIG detractor. So every time I make salsa for my family I have to look at my bowl and guesstimate “I think there are probably 3 oz of tomatoes in there? And 1/16 an onion??”

 1) Basal body temperature ➕ more “symptoms” available in cycle tracking, such as nausea, dizziness, and maybe a pain tracker that lets you pinpoint where you have pain. (Or maybe just a symptom tracker separate from the cycle tracker, so both men and women can see patterns in how they feel.)

Not sure if this problem is the app or my Fitbit; but the majority of the time when I open the app to sync, it appears like it’s trying to sync but it doesn’t connect to my Fitbit Inspire HR. When I click in the upper left corner and scroll down to the bottom to “Sync Now”, it won’t sync. I have to close and reopen the app multiple times for it to finally connect and sync.

I purchased the Inspire HR in March of this year, so I’ve had it now for about 3 months. 

I have also noticed as some other reviewers have stated that my Fitbit counts steps while I’m driving, but that has nothing to do with the app (as far as I’m aware).

-Add badges and trophies to the Fitbit watch; not only in the app, and add daily and weekly challenges to the Fitbit watch and app. Currently, the Fitbit app has badges and trophies, but you cannot receive them or see them on your watch. It would be better to send a notification to the watch once one has achieved a badge or trophy, and then be able to access and look at the badges and trophies on the watch. It would also be great if there was new challenges to try to keep people motivated and receive badges once finishing the challenge. The challenges could be from yoga to jogging to tread-milling, it would be amazing and benefit everyone to have a new daily challenge.
-Be able to set not only vibrating silent alarms, but both vibrating and sounding alarms. Many people don’t wake up because the Fitbit silent alarms are very quiet, or they wake up and fall right back asleep since the alarms don’t wake them up enough.

For reference, I have the latest update on iPhone XR and latest update on the Fitbit Inspire. 

Too often my exercises on the elliptical do not get tracked as an exercise. Instead, they track as active minutes. If I try to manually log my exercise, then my active minutes will show the exercise twice under active minutes. 

I’ve also had issues with my weight logs. My total weight lost was not being recorded correctly and I had to do some weird work around to get it sorted. So far, it seems to be working. 

Notifications from my phone that show up on the Fitbit disappear way too fast if I do not look at it right away. Not sure if it’s a bug or how the Fitbit is set up to be. Would be nice if they stayed longer or an option to scroll down to read them again if they have not been read on the phone.

I ended up turning all notifications off, but it would be great if we could select which types of notifications we want (messages from friends vs all notifications vs chatter etc) and the frequency of motivational notifications (once a day would be enough for me).

Stopped using it for a couple years when the Flex died. Got an Inspire 2 and I’m just having loads of problems.
The biggest is that it takes AGES for my Inspire 2 to sync with the app. It does not auto sync, although it’s supposed to (my Flex auto synced without issue). There are times I have to wait 20-30 minutes for it to sync, and sometimes I’ll wait that long and it will time out and nothing shows in the app!
Similarly for installing or uninstalling apps on the FitBit device (like Tile, or new clock faces). It takes ages, IF it works at all.
The app occasionally freezes when I try to input or edit my menstrual cycle. I’ll have to close it and reopen multiple times, and sometimes just have to wait a couple hours for it to work.

Oct 31 ‘18: Yet another update, another failed attempt at fixing a basic feature. In the past year, there have been 25 updates of the app, but they still haven’t fixed the settings to change the units, time zone, etc.
My Aria scale shows the correct units, but the app doesn’t. App doesn’t save any advanced settings. Setting time zone to Automatic doesn’t change anything; it doesn’t recognize my location.

Update Nov 1 ‘18: I received a dev response, but it was no help: “We'd like to clarify that the option to change units on the Fitbit app is available.” followed by a link. I know there is an option, obviously, but it doesn’t work. “In addition, we suggest force stopping the Fitbit app and rebooting your mobile device.” I did this, but it didn’t help.
I actually figured it out myself: First you have to login to the Dashboard to change your preferred units settings. Then after this, in the app, advanced settings should save after you change them. This works for whatever reason. 
As for the time zone, they simply suggest manually setting it, which is fair. But it could take a while to find your correct time zone: you have to scroll through a ton of cities and figure out which one is closest to you.

The ONE thing that really lacks is the food tracking interface and potential. I’ve used a number of apps to keep track of my calories, the breakdown of my meals and daily intake (carbs, proteins and fat), and more but this is just depressing to look at. It the design looks like it’s from 10+ years ago with a VERY basic list of what you ate and the calories, I mean it looks like someone put the bare amount of effort in developing this app.

Another app I used broke down EACH individual item you scanned giving it a grade to how healthy it was, explained the pros and cons of eating that and broke down the nutritional information in a beautiful screen. More so, each grade for items you are in a meal were added up to give each meal a overall grade which could be easily compared to the past week to see how your meal habits are improving or not.

Original complaint: Heartbeat data for example varies wildly, both from the moment to moment sensing of reality, and the accurate consolidation of that data into something like an exercise report… Two exact exercise cycles each day, done the same way, same time, intensity and duration - yield wildly different results… depending on how much data fell through the floor. Other data measurements are obviously software conjectures based indirectly off of some of the other data gathered - best guess data, rather than hard fact gathered with accurate sensors. Even things like the pedometer are guesses - based on arm movements, rather than legs. If you use a treadmill, your data is likely to be nonexistent. I use it, because my exercise program demands it, but it’s disappointing at best!

Update: Latest update is even buggier! The heart monitor is slower to catch up, and has been known to drop 1/3 - 1/2 of the data. Just did a heavy duty power walk where the monitor didn’t even notice until 15 minutes into the walk…. I monitor the pulse real time - so I can actually see the failure real time.

I purchased my first Fitbit as a Mother’s Day present for myself on May 10, 2015. I’ve never had to replace it. I’ve always wondered why folks around me, younger, always claimed it malfunctioned and/or they lost it to get you as a company to replace it for free. My original Fitbit still works. I don’t know for how much longer however I’m glad it does. 

I used to walk all the time, then I was diagnosed with breast cancer and couldn’t. Currently I’m going through breast cancer for the third time therefore I can’t walk right now however I can’t wait to beat it this 3rd time and begin to walk again with my Fitbit. 

I will walk with my Fitbit again and use the fabulous food calculator that comes with it. 

I hope mine never stop working and I hope I can find some more wrist bands that close like a watch instead of the one you press into your wrist. I also wish the bands came in breast cancer pink. 

I hope one day afford 2 Fitbit’s a month to put in my monthly baskets I make for random women (most perfect strangers) who are going through to encourage them to take charge of their health. It will happen.

Paying $200 for a tracker should mean that the app and its features should come included except for any add on content. Your Fitbit already collects heart rate data and movement data.

I like that it automatically adds in calories that are burned just by being alive. When you do a workout though it’s got some issues, especially with the elliptical. The only way you can even track a workout on the elliptical is if it recognizes it on its own. If I tell it I’m exercising it doesn’t even give the elliptical as an option and only tracks distance by gps which obviously doesn’t work on a stationary machine. I would like if it had an option of saying I’m on a stationary machine and also allowed you to place the tracker in your shoe or on your waist so that I could hold the stationary bar instead of the swinging bar the whole time.

I kept patience to use because I have been waiting for a new Apple Watch coming out. 4) Recently Fitbit forced us to change the App display with stupid design and there is no option for returning back to the old display.

None of the fitness data that the Fitbit generates is meaningful. The sleep data is garbage. Every single thing the app and device tell you is vanity-sized and basically dishonest. 

The device and app aren’t built around anyone with reasonable fitness. It won’t take ECG readings if your heart beats below 60 at rest. 60 BPM is “fat American normal,” which indicates that the entire premise of this device is for mediocre health only. 

I’m in the worst shape of my life and my heart rests at 50 bpm with no defects (medically checked.) And this device and app can’t process that … pitiful. It would have s41t the bed when I was resting at 35 bpm, running 12 miles a day, and biking another 40. And I wasn’t even an athlete - that was just for fun. 

This device, app, and subscription is all pure garbage and is only built for those with poor to mediocre fitness. It’s a digital pet to make you feel like the metrics will change your health… it won’t … the metrics will just distract you and falsely flatter you.

I wish the fitbit would overlay my period and ovulation onto heart rate chart.  I’d like to see if there’s a trend with ovulatory cycles vs anovulatory cycles and my resting heart rate. 
Also under the period tracker  section it lets you add cervical mucus properties like creamy or egg white. I notice that even when I ovulate way early and add egg white , lots of Cervical mucus it still can’t figure out that’s when I actually ovulated and not whenever it predicted I would ovulate which is almost always wrong now as my cycles have become sporadic . Can’t you add something so I can say when I ovulated? Certainly I would know better than the predicted  based on my body changes.",3,False,Aepalisades,Can you add this please?,Fitbit Health Fitness

Until a recent update syncing seemed to work even with only partial location services enable(only when using application), for me it no longer works and I often end up with a desynced device which I then have to fully enable the service to sync then switch it back.

I have been part of several chats within fitbit community asking for an improvement to show macros and percentages AND grams on the App for over a year. 

All the moderators do is say nice things. No one actually tells us it’s on the list to be done, or it won’t be done or maybe it will be done. No one responds. 

It is available on the website already. But not the App. Honestly, if you’re using a Fitbit product, chances are you use your phone-not a computer or laptop to track your food, because you’re more active.  

It is well documented that many many many people want this. 

What’s most disturbing is that no one from the fitbit team ever comments on any of these. It seems to me that fitbit doesn’t care about what their users want from the app. Even when it’s something very common on other apps. 

Sad that they tout themselves as a leader in user interface and have ignored this user suggestion since 2013. It’s on the website. It shouldn’t be hard to put it on the Phone App. 

In the main chat I am in we have collectively decided that the only way to get someone to hear us is to rate the product.  Sorry. But it’s true. 

Something needs to be done. Come on Fitbit, be the leaders in the industry you say you are.

The weight layout was changed. It used to tell you a range of weight where you’re “good” if you’re trying to maintain weight.

However, there are two things in my opinion that need to be fixed. It’s way too easy for just anyone to create an account. With that said, the app is plagued with romance scammers or scammers in general. I understand I can remove and block them, but they are flooding the Fitbit app. Ive seen plenty of others who notice the same thing and post about it. I think it would better to have only those with registered Fitbit devices to join. It’s just a suggestion.

The second thing is something I noticed with the icons on the app. Normally, there’s an icon on the bottom right to view your profile.

It’s helped me lose weight and I’m thankful for this. However, I have noticed some buggy issues and discrepancies. 

1. The dashboard where it gives you a highlight of all your stats you’re tracking doesn’t always update my calorie intake after I have logged a food. Today is the first day I’ve noticed this happening and I hope it didn’t happen in the past. I use the dashboard a lot to get a quick glimpse of how many calories I have left to consume before making food decisions. 

2. I am not sure how food gets in the database but today I noticed a discrepancy when I was logging JUST Egg today. I scanned the barcode on the bottle and according to the bottle 3 Tbs is 70 calories. However, when I scanned the bottle to the FitBit app, it told me 3 Tbs is 45 calories. There needs to be some type of accuracy check or something. 

3. I had an issue logging my PF Chang’s meal yesterday. There’s 2 instances of PF Chang’s menus with different nutrition information for the same foods. It was cumbersome to get through and I had to go on the PF Chang website to verify the calorie information. Definitely didn’t make this convenient.

The Fitbit App is excellent for tracking basic information about my exercise, steps, calories, etc. I do not use many of the features, like tracking sleep, because I don’t like wearing the device 24/7. It’s super handy for what I need. 

My only complaint is that the developers are non-responsive to fundamental concerns of users. I canceled my Premium membership because the calories tracked were not synced to my body weight/height, which threw off ALL my stats. Interval workouts flip the rest/move stats on the app so that the data is opposite to what the device says. Both these issues have multiple complaints on Fitbit forums, and the advice is either “we’re working on that” (for years with no fix) or  some version of “restart your device.”

Fitbit needs to make some reliable trusted apps. On the plus side I found making an click face simple. But not everyone is a developer. Do I also have to make my own apps.

Support is horrible too.  When I contacted them about an issue with the message indicator, the issue was acknowledged and I was told I should just deal with it.  There was no concern and no intention of fixing the problem.

This is an ok app but it seems to have a lot of little problems which are annoying and if fixed would make it a great app.  

First, I’ve had an unread notifications indicator showing for weeks though I have no unread notifications.  I contacted support and after about a dozen emails back and forth, they said, sorry it’s a bug.  No indication that they intend to fix it.

Second, when logging food, there is no way to delete or even update an entry once you save.  I was testing this feature out and this is a deal breaker.  I already gave another app that works great.

so you know how there is like community groups? so I was wondering, fitbit should make a community group for children & teenagers! 

this would be great because a lot of adolescents want to lose weight, and it would be great because we could motivate each other, and we could give each other advice, since we are all almost going through the same thing-

so it would be great to see fellow people around my age who want to achieve their goals, like me!

plus, teenagers and children, have different goals then adults, so it would be awesome to have a group because growing people have different requirements then adults.

Apple already is far superior in terms of apps (free and paid) available on their app store, so it seems bizarre to me that the few limited areas where fitbit excels (fitness stats/diagnostics/activities) would be blocked by an expensive paywall.

Above is an old review I wrote. I’ve had at least 4 fitbits over the years. The software and hardware have had plenty of issues, most sorted out over (too much) time. The challenges were the only thing that kept me and many others with fitbit. Funny that they kept things proprietary so you couldn’t have cross platform challenges, and now they are not only taking away features that people bought, but that kept people on the platform.

It will indicate that I went to sleep an hour or more later than my actual bedtime and I am not referring to my fall asleep time. I would get if it indicated that I was awake and not able to fall asleep. I’ve used it together with another tracker and there is a daily difference of over 2000 steps. When I an cooking or baking it does not track any steps. I’ve noticed that it also doesn’t track my steps at grocery stores. I will walk all through Costco and for some reason I will hardly have any steps.

First, the silent alarm.
That’s a great feature of the tracker. You tell the app to set an alarm at 6am and it tells the tracker, right? No. The app tells the website. Then the tracker does a sync, meaning your phone sends data from the tracker to the website, and then lets the website make settings changes to the tracker. Oh, you want to enable an alarm *and* adjust its time? That requires two syncs. Oops, haven’t synced in a while? That’s going to cost you several minutes. 

Second, the heart rate plots. You have two choices:
1. Three Vertical axis ticks with weirdo numbers like 50, 98, 146 (based on your min and max rates for that day) and no time axis ticks. Just labels for midnight, noon, and midnight. Great that the data is recorded every 5 minutes, but it’s impossible to tell when a peak occurred.

The FitBit tracker measures:
Heart Rate
Calories Burned
Steps Taken
Miles Traveled
Active Minutes
Stairs Climbed
Hours Slept

The APP logs all your activity and saves it for past, present and future comparison. 

PROS:
My favorite things about it are the Sleep Tracking and the Heart Rate Monitoring.  
Both are very accurate and useful. 

The Sleep log measures:
Awake Minutes
REM Sleep
Light Sleep
Deep Sleep

It does a GREAT job at measuring
Calories Burned, Steps Taken, Miles Traveled and Active Minutes, also. 

Both the APP and the FitBit tracker are very easy to use.

The FitBit tracker can also be used to receive texts and phone call alerts. 

CONS:

I like that the app is loaded with workouts but find it counter productive that there isn’t an option to make a playlist or save workouts.

Update: I still hate the new dashboard. It’s more difficult to read, the colors are boring, the goal achievement animations are gone. Frankly, the developer response came off as condescending. If you feel like you have to send an existing customer an article on how to use your product, you haven’t really made it better or easier to use.

I don't know if it's the hormone changes I'm experiencing, but it is maddening when the APP decides to reset my cycle to day #1 even when I'm really on day #29 (or whatever).

For instance the heart rate charts use a scale that is not fine enough to discern the rate with much precision.  How about a finer scale, labeling min/max, and allowing two finger expansion of the chart to examine particular time frames?  Also the heart rate monitoring in combo with the new Charge 3 seems to miss spikes in rate.  It appears that heart rate might only be sampled periodically which misses the mark for aerobic athletes.  Also the integration with Strava is presented as easy but is maddeningly difficult.  Bike rides never show the heart rate in Strava for some reason so I may have to buy a chest strap for rides and had hoped to avoid that.  Not sure who’s fault that is but maybe Strava’s.

Integration with third party weight scales is terrific in my sample of one.  Weight Gurus has it nailed.  A cool FitBit function set is better than the scale’s own app.

I was happy to find that the FitBit app could read that data. However, the app is disappointing in a number of ways. The most frustrating is performance. Often when I launch the app to see my step count, I wait... and wait... and wait. It takes forever. Sometimes it just takes a second or two, but that's unusual. I've tried two other M-chip-based pedometer apps, and both are consistently fast. They never make me wait.

The latest version has a new annoyance: it requires repeated logins. The main reason I still use this frustrating app is for IFTTT integration, but if it has logged me out, that doesn't work.

Finally, why doesn't the app support the Apple health app? It feels like FitBit is just being spiteful at the expense of its customers.

UPDATE:

It's even worse now. Many days it doesn't record a single step. It doesn't repeatedly ask me to log in anymore, so that's an improvement. But if it doesn't do the primary function of the app - count steps - then one star is too high a rating. Just terrible.

However, for me as the parent to see each of their info is MASSIVELY cumbersome.  And switching between children’s views requires SO many taps just to view each of their prior nights sleep.  It could be so much easier.

Currently, when in a kid’s view, I have to click on their profile, then click switch to parent view, then click to confirm switch to parent view, then type in my password, then click to submit.  Then I’m in my personal view, and I have to click my profile, and then scroll down to click to switch to kid view. 

It doesn’t make sense for it to be that difficult.  I can hardly imagine any reason for someone else to have access to your kids Fitbit, such that it requires that much security.

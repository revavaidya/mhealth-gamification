2021-09-06 15:54:36,"I have tried so many different diet apps, and this is my favorite one by far. It’s so user friendly/simple yet detailed without being confusing or overwhelming. Plus it is by far the fastest tracker, lightning fast to enter in all your foods/meals. It is also extremely accurate as far as calories, and the data base is huge. The recipes are great too. I had used the free version quite a bit, which is really nice yet pretty basic on its own. (There are absolutely no annoying ads or invasive pop-ups in the free version and it’s a great experience.) I decided to go ahead and get premium though, and am glad I did. I’ve had a lot of success with losing weight and feel really motivated. Not to mention I plan to continue to track most days even after I’m done losing because they automatically adjust everything (calories/any activity) to help you maintain once you’re done. That to me is where I would gain again, was I’d stop being as mindful of tracking once I lost weight so this is very helpful. If I had one suggestion to the developers it would be to possibly add in the ability to implement intermittent fasting into the program if you should choose to. I use another Ap to track my fasting times. It would be great if this combined that option. One example is that it says I “skipped recording calories” for some meals when in actuality I was fasting at the time. This is not that big of a deal, and definitely still 5 stars despite this. It would just be even nicer.",5,False,My Favorite Diet Ap,Essenceofclarity1970,,Calorie Counter My Net Diary
2022-08-21 13:43:50,"In general, I HATE apps, but I wanted to lose some weight and this one looked, at least, interesting.
But MyNetDiary turns out to be incredibly useful, even in ways I wouldn't have expected. It's really intuitive, and provides an enormous database of both fresh and packaged foods--impressive because I'm gluten-intolerant and eat a lot of pretty obscure brands of bread, etc, and I wouldn't expect that many people would have ever heard of them.
Logging what I've eaten is actually kind of fun, and I even do it when I've binged on too many calories and would usually just not bother counting them because I'd be too embarrassed at my lack of self-discipline. And I love the very precise breakdown of all of the nutrients, which is important to me because I'm also a vegetarian (yes, I am a pain to feed!) and now I have a better idea about how to get more protein and various other nutrients that I need because of my weird diet.
And tracking my water intake is really helpful, too, as I've gotten a little lax about drinking enough (water!), and now I'm more motivated about that, too.
Sorry--long review (I also hate writing reviews, so the fact that I did this one should tell you how impressed I am with this app!).  Very soon I should be back to my ideal weight, and probably a lot healthier than I've been in a while (oh, yeah--the app also works with my Apple watch to keep track of my activity and workouts...awesome).",5,False,Really Well-Designed,ngbev,,Calorie Counter My Net Diary

I was using My Fitness Pal for years and did a premium trial which I was enjoying. The cost of their premium subscription really made me look at other apps. When I came across MyNetDiary it took me a few weeks to really go through the information because there's so much. I noticed a deal for the premium subscription so I thought I'd try it out. Since subscribing I have deleted my meal plan app, my grocery shopping app and my water tracking app. Because this app has it all! With this app I can customize pretty much everything - my macro nutrient percentages, water intake goals and alerts, micro nutrient goals, workout calories (connects to Apple watch) groceries list, diet specific recipes and Soo much more. 
The one thing that is a slight downside is the barcode scan doesn't have a very large database and many items I scan are not read. The upside to this is that you can manually add the nutrition information and pictures and upload them, therefore adding to the database. Customer support is very quick. I had an email reply within minutes. There is still a lot more information in the app that I haven't even looked into yet.

Seeing a nutritionist and having this app have been two of the most effective tools I’ve had on my journey.

It’s simple to use and displays my progress in a clear, visual way. At a glance, I can see how far I am on my daily goal and how well I’ve been doing for the entire week. Entering food takes so little time that I can enter it right after eating without any disruption to what I’m doing. The only things I would change about the app is its mindfulness of the user’s goals. I don’t really mind seeing tips on how to loose weight while using the app, but it would be awesome if the messaging changed according to which direction the user wanted the scale move. It would also be great if the app had a “pre-tracking” feature. Sometimes I pack my meals the day before.

One of my favorite features is that I can send them screen shots of my meal kit nutritional info and they verify and add it to the database within hours.

So, for example, if you are eating out but asked for a substitution in your entree or maybe didn’t eat the bread, you can just enter the whole entree and subtract a food from it.

Ease of use: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ trained monkey🐒 (they even have tips with arrows pointing and explaining things on the screen)

Developers response: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Im always encouraged when I look at the reviews for an app and see the developer actively responding to issues users post about their app. I usually start from “most critical” first to see what issues others have had and what, if any the developer has responded to. I discount personal issues, I’m sorry but if you have an eating disorder (I’m mean most of us probably do whether it’s over or under eating, otherwise why would we need the app 😂) blaming the app instead of taking responsibility for under or over eating is a cop out and just lazy.

My philosophy in using MyNetDiary is to target a total A- rating each day for the day total.  Each meal should be A- and snacks, although these may total B+, should not result in the daily total being A-.  These goals are especially handy when for whatever reason, travel, etc., result in an unusual choice of breakfast items, etc.  You can then use MyNetDiary to see if a serving of low-fat cheese or a couple of boiled egg whites will bring you back to an A- rating for the meal or snacks.  Targeting all 3 meals at an A- rating is a great strategy.  This results in having high quality protein, veggies and/or fruit and small amounts of quality carbs, ideal for either weight loss or maintaining your ideal weight.

2020-07-31 15:39:11,"So I’ve been wanting to lose weight and I find this app is pretty helpful with letting me know what foods are good and keeping me on track calorie wise. I initially downloaded this app to make sure I eat enough in a day because I am more likely to eat the base amount of calories if I’m keeping track. I like how it lets you know your caffeine intake, it can link up to your steps, and lets you know how much trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol you are in taking.
However, if you have ever had and ED or are struggling with one, I would be cautious with downloading this. It gives you grades based on the food you eat which inherently isn’t bad, but because ED’s are very competitive, it could become dangerous. It also congratulates you if you don’t eat all the set amount of calories for the day, which is incredibly dangerous in my opinion and the reason why I am writing this review.

Countless diet plans can miserably starve you to a desired weight but once arrived at the ideal weight, then what? If you’re not counting, your driving your human car without knowing what the proper fuel level is.

Once I understood that the body burns 1500 calories a day just resting, one can grasp the logic it would take to lose & maintain body weight.  I know that I need at least 700 calories in a meal to feel nourished & comfortable; so 3 of these a day for me is perfectly comfortable & I'm still losing weight.  I also compensate for larger meals by eating less the following meal to maintain my average.

Don't let Restaurants define what constitutes a full meal for you; they are thinking value to keep their business, we have to think human body logic.  A typical combo meal is way, way over anyone's daily calorie budget.  Just get the sandwich, not the chips or fries.  And only 1 sugar drink per meal, no refills except water or soda water.

I hade the grading scale on what I am eating.  Not everything is perfect in my world and there are times when I am going to eating something I always know could be better.  The real issue is when by adding brown rice to a Beal it changes from a B+ to a C-.  That makes no sense because fiber is great for everything.

So, I’m ignoring the grades

I knew that this made no sense, but I wanted to check out how bogus it was. Of course, it immediately needed payment info, hoping I would forget about in when the free trial ran out. And just because I wanted to see how accurate it was, I measured my BPM (it said 26, I’m at 90), then I tried a bag of chips, and it read 123, and said I had “low energy levels”, after these tests it wanted access to my health app (never allow applications like this have access to you info, their selling it). I can also see that the creators are obviously botting their reviews, and deleting real ones. Also, their little ad campaign of “this app is saving thousands of lives a year” is so scummy.

2023-07-21 12:06:42,"I recently decided to give Inpulse Premium a try after hearing about their impressive features and benefits. However, I must express my disappointment with the lack of transparency regarding their free trial offer. 

When I first stumbled upon their website, I was excited to see that they were offering a free trial period. This feature was prominently advertised as a great opportunity to explore their premium services without any financial commitment. It seemed like the perfect chance for me to determine whether Inpulse Premium was a good fit for my needs. 

However, upon signing up, I quickly discovered that no free trial was actually provided. Instead, I was immediately prompted to input my billing details and charged for a full subscription without even having an opportunity to try their services. The lack of transparency and follow-through on their free trial promise disappointed me greatly. 

Inpulse Premium should be more forthright with their customers, clearly communicating that a free trial is not available before requesting payment details. By not offering the trial they initially advertised, it feels a lot like a bait-and-switch tactic, where potential customers are enticed with a promise that is not fulfilled.

Moreover, the lack of an option to request a refund adds to my frustration. After realizing that there was no free trial, I reached out to their customer support, only to be met with unsatisfactory responses and no willingness to address the issue. It's disheartening to feel trapped into a subscription I did not intend to start.

As a potential customer, I highly value honesty and integrity in the companies I choose to invest my time and money in. Inpulse Premium's failure to deliver on their free trial promise and their lack of willingness to rectify the situation has left me extremely dissatisfied.

Despite Inpulse Premium's claims of exceptional services, their deceptive practices and poor customer service overshadow any potential benefits. I would caution others to be wary of their advertised free trial and be prepared for unexpected charges right from the start.

In conclusion, I regretfully advise against subscribing to Inpulse Premium, as their failure to provide a promised free trial and handle customer issues appropriately has left me with a sour experience.",1,False,Disappointed with Inpulse Premium's Free Trial Promise,Rideop20carol,"{'id': 37940385, 'body': ""Hello! We apologize for any inconvenience and disappointment you experienced with our free trial offer. We always strive for transparency and want to ensure our customers are well-informed about our subscription conditions. Please note that we offer several subscription plans, and not all of them come with a free trial. It's possible that you may have selected a plan that doesn't provide this feature. Regarding the concern about charging users immediately after starting a free trial, we want to assure you that such a practice is impossible. Apple strictly regulates the billing process and reviews every app before its release on the App Store to ensure fair practices. Regarding the refund request issue, we regret any frustration you encountered when trying to address it with our customer support. However, it's important to note that all refunds are handled directly by Apple, so reaching out to their customer support would be the appropriate step. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience and negative experience you had with our app. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we are committed to improving our services to provide a better experience for all our users.\n\nIf you have any further concerns or if there's anything else we can do for you, please don't hesitate to contact us directly at support@aiby.com.

I took a reading immediately after exercising and my heart rate was obviously elevated… that’s the point of working out right?

You can literally do all these things free.

Checking your heart rate for example can be done by using your apple watch every hour or so for free. 

Checking your heart health, can be done using other better apps that are cheaper and provide much more insight. 

And as for those who suffer from depression like me, there are many apps, games, and even websites where you can take these same exact quizes for free.

Not to mention this app looks almost exactly one by fulminate holdings, same name same look, with the only noticable change being in their logo which is still very similar, So I am pretty sure this one is a scam app and a knockoff, and if you did pay for a subscription or do the trial, make sure to keep track of your bank account(s) just in case this one is one of those with a virus that has been found in many android and even some ios apps.

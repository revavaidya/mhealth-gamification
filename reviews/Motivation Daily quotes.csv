Sometimes I would look at it whenever I felt like I didn‚Äôt know what to do in a situation regarding my life, future, however you may call it‚Ä¶.but I can say that this is a good app for anyone who may be drifting through motions of sadness, self-doubt etc. Now there are many quotes here in which I believe were gathered throughout history that many famous & influential people, personalities, individuals across all nationalities, religions etc. who were by societal norms successful and contributed in their own lives in a different manner to their personal circumstances and areas of focus. 

Regardless, they still rose above any obstacle that may have encountered in their path because we all need help regardless of how we may view ourselves at any moment. This is just my own personal opinion of what I believe is a very good approach for self care in this regard. Now that‚Äôs not to say that there are also many alternatives like books, community, human connection or other social interactions & hobbies to name few. But for those who may have trouble understanding how they might feel in relationships, life, where they may fit in this huge world, isolation along with loneliness and depression can swallow them up but I would like to say that I‚Äôm at least thankful for the support and encouragement.

2020-01-03 16:53:41,"So, I got this app, and I was looking through it and everything. Then I notice that practically everything is locked. I press it to see how to unlock it, and you have to pay. Not for that singular one, but to do basically anything on the app at all, you have to pay either monthly or yearly. A decent amount of money, too. I don‚Äôt want to spend money on this app MONTHLY just to unlock quotes that I could easily just search up on google or something instead. There is a lifetime option, but thats nearly 50 dollars. WAY too much for something like this, I‚Äôll say. Being already irritated about this, I then come back to the app store to write a review to find that in the pictures that describe the app, it does NOT say ANYTHING about everything being locked. In the picture, there is no lock symbols. Anywhere. It doesn‚Äôt warn you about anything. So basically I just spent a half hour only to find that you have to pay for everything.
      In conclusion, for people who like to save their money and not spend it monthly or yearly on an app like this, I suggest just search inspiring quotes up on google, pinterest, or any browser you have. Its easier, and a lot cheaper. Anyway, if the items in this app did not cost so much, it would be a fantastic app to use.

2019-02-09 19:32:24,"I love this app but I love the Valentine's deal even better!  The quotes were unique, I'm a sucker for great inspirational quotes and I have lots of apps for that purpose... But with this Motivation app, I'm surprised to see so many quotes that I wasn't aware of and I love them!   The only thing stopping me from buying a subscription is the price, it's incredibly steep in comparison to my other apps. I don't mind paying for it but not like highway robbery.

 If it was the same market price as with the others, it would have been justifiable. So I just did my copy and paste method in my Evernote to collect the quotes I love manually for a couple of months now.

On Oct 3, 2020 my 12 yr old dog, Marley died.  I got Marley a couple years after my 19 yr-old son tragically died,  she helped me to start accepting his death and helped me to start my new life without him physically being there with me.  I lost my husband a little more than 5 yrs after my son died. I have to say losing them nearly destroyed me...  I kept going because my daughter and Marley needed me...  It's been 3 days since I lost Marley and I‚Äôm not taking Marleys death that well either.  Then I received this motivational quote... 
       
               ""[...] when u know,
                        you know. 
              And you don't fight it.
       You don't deny the inevitable.
          You freefall because you            
       know there's someone there
    to catch you on the other side...""

In addition the app is very inconsistent, you are allowed to set scheduled quotes, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to work or last long. Finally the creators of this app clearly feel the need to press there own political and social messages, rather than presenting a well rounded sample of world views in there quote selection. After more than a week of not receiving a single quote (despite being scheduled for daily quotes) I was sent one by now Elliot Paige, only a day or so after declaring that she is now a man. There is nothing wrong with the quote or Paige, rather this is cheap virtue signaling. In other words, this app feeds quotes that say you need to be Woke AF and will clearly prioritize people they see in that light like Elliot Paige.

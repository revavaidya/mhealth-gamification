I would love to have more choices when it comes to the exercises. They  have to think about your physical health, age, and weight. Some exercises are just made for people who are fit, young or both. At the beginning the exercises are modified to a beginner, but then they get more challenging. The problem is that after months of exercising when you’re overweight and older, your knees start feeling the pain,  so I do recommend they stay on a modified exercise when it comes to putting all the weight on your knees or giving you the option within the app. 

Also, it’s important to provide two feel good options because it helps you achieve that goal for that day, and also you have an option for those days when your life was crazy busy, active, and full of chaos. 

Lastly, I have had many problems of it crashing down in the middle of my workout many, many times! This also discourages all the effort we put into a healthier lifestyle. I have even tried it several times, but it constantly crashes down. Also, I can’t even delete and reinstall the app because it might delete all my data.

I am in my late 20s and looking to keep an active and healthy lifestyle. This app has great options. I subscribed and I really enjoy the daily 'do your exercises' that fit directly in what I am looking for. I also like the 'workouts' section if I am looking to work a little more on a specific muscle group. 

Yet, for me honestly I do feel that the food and dietary section is not useful to me. I am not looking for nutritional advice, im only looking for workout ideas so this to me is not useful. I would advice BetterMe to have a full seperate app just for nutrition and one just for workouts with the possibility of merging data from both apps together if the user wants to. Otherwise, a lot of the data on this is just not useful to some people. I do get the whole concept of being a full plan of food and exercise but thats my experience. 

Another think I want to point out is the 'do your workouts' section of the Plan page. Some days it recommends walking, other days it recommends a full 25 minute exercise routine -which is exactly what i love about this app and why I subscribed to it. Yet, skme days when i check the 'do your workout' section it says 'today walking' it doesn't make sense. I suggest modifying the Plan page to include under the 'do your workouts' section a 'walking' subsection and an 'exercises' subsection.

The water tracker is nice, and I haven’t tried the workouts yet since I use another app for those that is easing me into them.

Functions I appreciated: keeping track of nutritional intake, daily steps, weight , and a variety of at home exercise videos to do at your own pace and fitness level. 
What I don’t appreciate: In the app it shows tracking heart rate, and sleep. A promo plug kept encouraging me to purchase a $60 better me fitness band to maximize all the above. Sadly that’s a lie. The band isn’t even fully compatible with their app yet. $60 wasted. The band took 6 weeks to receive which was a bit ridiculous. 
Over all I lost over 15 pounds in 2 months but I contribute it all to managing calories because I only did a couple of the workouts a week due to being a night shift nurse with a limited amount of time to work out. I did reach out to them and they suggested fasting often which I already did, but not by choice.  I like the workouts when I can do them but I’m not sure if it’s worth the cost since I’ve yet to compare it to anything else. 
I’d like to see compatibility to band and app, a better way to customize workouts to specific days vs daily reminders that I’m not working out.

I enjoy the little quizzes you have daily, and the water intake tracker, but that’s really where the niceties end with this app. 
Logging food is near impossible and not user friendly at all. The only measurements they have for most items is in ounces, and even then half the time it doesn’t pick up the fractions of an ounce you try to log in. Its food library is VERY limited, so good luck finding a barcode it will take. You’ll be entering in a lot of foods manually.  
  While the fasting countdown is a great visual to use, you can’t reset it. If you forget to hit start or stop, it keeps on keeping on. There really needs to be a way to adjust the times on it to be accurate. Plus, if you’re done eating, but not yet to the end of your eating window, you can’t start your fasting window early!  Sorry, but I don’t eat the ENTIRE 8 hours of my eating window. It’s like the developers don’t understand intermittent fasting? 
 To top it all off, it doesn’t sync up with fitbits. It’s not even an option. So unless you have an Apple Watch and/or want to carry your phone with you 24/7, your steps aren’t counted, and you can’t manually enter steps or workouts.

For example if I meal prep I should be able to copy the meals from the day prior into my next day of tracked meals instead of individually typing items all over again, the food items are scaled to Oz even though they are inputted as grams which is time consuming to go and covert the serving unit every single time. Now let’s talk about the workout. Day 1 was labeled Brazilian Booty in which there was no glute exercise. This is a full body workout that had abs and shoulders. The movements being demonstrated are jerky and fast lacking in proper form/technique. I DO HOWEVER enjoy the way the workout is designed so you can move along with it, timer and everything.  Water tracker, if I accidentally click too many times I see no way of deleting my mistake in order to accurately track water intake over time.

The calorie counter section does not include many options the barcode scanner does not pick up barcodes leaving you to enter them on your own.

Instead, the app has been designed and launched to easily track your daily workouts progress and weight, monitor calories and water intakes, count activities, and many more! It's a pity you haven't found the Calorie tracker useful as it offers a few options to log foods. For example, go to the Plan tab and tap the Add Food option; then choose a mealtime and hit Add Food and proceed with logging your meals.  \nYet, at the moment, our barcode database is limited, and some meals can be barely found. But we are constantly working on improving it. We hope you understand it's a time-consuming process and I do appreciate your patience. \nAs to the 7-day-trial, there are different license types of various prices and conditions of use; hence, many of them do include that trial week but it depends. It's necessary to carefully read the subscription terms upfront.\nFeel free to get back to us at gethelp@betterme.tips in case you have any other questions or requests.

I was prepared to potentially waste $40 if it wasn’t as good as it appeared. Aaaand…  It’s not. I found the process to track food cumbersome. The barcode scan didn’t work on a single food I tried and many foods weren’t found in the database at all, so I had to manually enter the macros. No ability I could find to copy a meal, so I had to go through the same annoying process of entering each component of my breakfast every morning. After Day 3 of that, I’d had enough. Other features, such as weight and exercise tracking, were difficult to navigate to and set up. Nothing user friendly at all about this app. $40 blown. That they don’t offer a 7-day trial should tell you something. 

There are far better options out there, so I’d suggest googling “best health and fitness app” and reading a few articles to find one. That’s what I did and found a far superior option for about the same investment.

I also like how it tells you how many calories you burned at the end of each workout. The workouts are targeted towards specific problem areas so you can tailor your workouts to your needs. 

However, the diet part of this app needs a lot of help. There is no way to put food preferences in to avoid seeing those recipes (ex I don’t like quinoa or beef liver). Also, not all the recipes match. The directions will be for something other than the recipe or ingredient list. The ingredient list doesn’t always tell you how much of something you are including in that recipe (ex 1 piece cottage cheese - what does that mean?). Calorie counts per meal are not included. I would expect this from a free app but not one for $10 a month. I’m on my free trial right now and I’m not sure I want to pay for this unless it was fixed.

After reading other reviews, I checked out the billing and it does seem pricey for what is offered ($10/mo). Mine had the 6-month automatic $42 subscription selected already, so that would have been a crappy surprise. That does lower the price by $3/mo though, so I can see the benefit and will likely leave it that way. An earlier warning about the price would be good though, I’ve seen other apps put the subscription prices in the app description, so people don’t feel deceived when their account is automatically charged.

Reasons for not giving a 5 are, iPhone and IPad apps don’t work together. App should be device neutral-  Use the devise you have and have any activity or workouts sync up. 

Also app is a little buggy with playback of some workouts with no prompts or visuals. Just ticks down the time  remaining in the exercise. 

Also, profile asks for focus areas yet always provides the same types of workout recommendation even with all areas selected…Arms. I would expect that if more than one focus area was selected, that the recommendations would not always be arms. I don’t have the time to preview the possible workouts everyday to pick the one I want. Want the app to do that for me based on the focus areas selected. 

Lastly, scheduling reminders for workouts if setup, should also drive when workouts at suggested. I use the app to supplement Taekwondo training twice a week. I’d like to not get workouts on those days but the schedule doesn’t really do anything other than pop up a message. It should have those days as off in the suggested workouts.

I’ve enjoyed the workouts, intermittent fasting, and especially the daily inspirational reads so far. I downloaded another fitness app to compare and see which one I’d like to stick with for subscription.

 The biggest thing that stands out is that BetterMe does not have an option for manually documenting your weight, and doesn’t have a lot of foods saved by scanning the barcode on items. Also, I have to spend a lot of time each day tracking down my regular food items since they get booted out of the Recent food selection. Logging daily calories should be easier than this. I like so many other things about the app and would happily stay with this product if they can provide an update on the weight & calorie tracking.",4,False,"Great app, needs food log updates",BellaNa27,BetterMe Health Coaching

This app is all about breadth, not depth.

How their workouts work is that they have thousands of ~30 second clips (e.g crunches, ice skaters, mermaid stretch) that they stitch together to create a ton of pretty good workouts.

The workouts are where it shines. The calisthenics, boxing, ab workouts are all stellar. There are some UX glitches (no audio for some exercises). Quite frequently, they’ll say “hold for 30-60 seconds” when the countdown is 10-20 seconds.

That said, there are some concerns about the workouts. The calorie count is a total sham. Pretty sure they assign random digits to the clips. I just did the EASIEST, most pathetic yoga flow (called Calorie Burner, but trust me when I write it was literally just mountain pose and child pose for about 7 minutes) and it said I burned 180 calories.

The diet feature is good. They have a ton of foods to track, and you can edit portions etc. But then part of their daily routine is a mindful listen or read, which is great in practice. But the diet ones can be misleading. Eg, grapes are awful for you with this App—even though food science says grapes are great for you: high in potassium, fiber, and full of water so you get full faster.

Overall, it’s great for giving me a diverse array of workout routines when I’m stuck at home or traveling.",3,False,"Solid app, but some workouts and diets need improving",ChrisB511,BetterMe Health Coaching

I personally am not able to pretzel myself up because I’m not very flexible. It feels like it’s more geared towards people who are already in shape. And some of this beginners stuff is just crazy.

The workouts are just my speed and the interactions are fairly easy to keep up with. I also love the reminders and accountability provided via the notifications.
The areas I think need improvement:
Food tracker: Everything is measured in ounces. I do not plan on weighing my food. Having the option to adjust the serving size makes it compatible for all types of lifestyles. I currently don’t use that feature because it just doesn’t work for what I’m doing.
Fast tracker: I love this option and the reminders to start or end your fast. My complaint is I cannot adjust the times of my fast. If I forget to stop the tracker, I cannot edit the end time. If I forget, then the tracker is completely off until I decide to start it again. Some days are busier than others so being able to edit would be nice. 
Demonstration videos: The videos are extremely helpful as several of the workouts are new to me. The issue is the voice and the video don’t always match. The video will show arms down to the side, but the voice will say, arms bent at a 90 degree angle. Which is accurate? It’s a small issue, but when aiming for safety and effectiveness, it matters.

After diving into the app myself, I noticed that those 1* reviews are just a matter of not reading the terms and navigating your own profile because if you go to your own profile in the app, you can:
1- you can change the “units” from grand to pounds
2- make your workouts harder than what it auto-set up as
3- yes you have to UNsubscribe “in” the app in your profile but it states that before signing up and when you unsubscribe it asks “Are you sure because you will loss all of your profile information if you unsubscribe now”

What I LOVE the most, on day 1, is the phenomenal content on Day 1 audio which is about being able to successfully do this is all in your MIND. The content they talk about is so true and I know it’s hard for a lot of people to understand this but it is really good content, and true, so if you follow it, it will work for you!

I may come back and do another review after my 12 weeks but wanted to clarify what brought me a bit of fear after reading reviews and say I think this is a great app so far!",4,False,Just got the app!,revis layne,BetterMe Health Coaching

The workouts are ok but the menu options are a little off. Today I had 1 recipe w/ no bake temp, 1 recipe that needed olives but said nothing about the olives in the instructions, 1 recipe used Celsius (which was easy to google the right temp in F) and so on. Also, I’m unable to make certain preferences. They have the major food issues but nothing for ppl who don’t eat specific foods. (Ex: Buckwheat, chia, squash, zucchini) Sadly I don’t like those things and more but I’m unable to remove them from my meal lists. Also, today the app said my meals were to help burn belly fat. However, if I decide to change a meal, which I’m going to do, I’m unsure if I’m changing it to the same type of “belly fat burning” meal or just some random meal. I want to make sure I lose the weight properly but if your menus are flawed then I will need to look elsewhere for a meal plan. 

Also, when I first signed up I placed the incorrect start weight and now I can’t change it. 

Last but not least, I know for a fact I don’t walk 2,420 steps a day but somehow the app continues to log steps. I feel like it logs when I drive but I’m not entirely sure. 

If I were looking to purchase this app, I would try a monthly plan to make sure it’s right instead of the yearly. You might find this is for you, you might find it’s not. Either way, good luck on your weight loss journey 🤗",2,False,Ehhh,LilOl'Mi89,BetterMe Health Coaching

I return to my usual healthy eating patterns. When asked in onboarding if I needed nutritional advice or wanted help with it I checked no. First thing on the reading portion was about mindset. Asked questions about how I react to food after a stressful day and honestly I didn’t fit anywhere into the answers given, but in order to move forward I had to pick one.

Today I started the first day of my free 7 day trial and honesty I’m very happy to say that I really like this app! 

I gave this app 5 stars because it not only shows you how to do the exercises but it lets you go on your own pace unlike workout videos  ! Here are a couple if things that i noticed I really liked!  

It gives you the rep number and while trying to figure out how to do the exercise, you are not being rushed. There is an animated person (you) doing the exercise with you and showing you how its done. 

Another thing i like about the app is that, it gives you recipes (that may seem weird) but they’re just suggestions that can seem to be really helpful especially for someone who doesn't know exactly how to eat healthy ! 

Lastly, i like that the app wants you to be comfortable with your body! The exercises you choose would be based on what you want to work out!

I closed the app and reopened, and made sure I was signed in, still there was nothing… I double checked my online account, it showed my previous two week workout time records, but nothing else… I reported the issue, a week has passed, no one even got back to me.

In the meantime, I didn’t want to loose the exercise momentum, so I started from day 1 again, but adding a few other routines through the app’s large pool of workout sessions. However, today I realized, after a long sweaty full cardio session, that the app did not log my workout minutes… (yes I was following the session found in the app). I went ahead and tried to manually log them in, the app would not let me (tried countless times)

The offered a calorie tracker where I could enter in my calories for the day.

That’s fine, I could manually input my calories, but there’s I cannot manually input anything else so there’s no way I can track carbs or fats, things that are also important to me.

What bothers me most is that the items list is super chaotic. If you cannot find the food to log, you can save a new title (which sounds great), but i guess the app makes each user title public, so there are dozens of “avocado”s to pick up. (Some/most of them are not accurate.) All in all, i dont log my meals anymore but i do exercise.",4,False,logging meals should be improved,muhallebimualla,BetterMe Health Coaching

It no longer offers the stretching challenge, the plank challenge, the leg challenge and other challenges I enjoyed. I see now they charge extra for these things. Why even charge to use the app if I will have to pay to do challenges as well. Under fitness There are only 6 different types of plans. They no longer separated easy, moderate, and hard workout from each other. I was so disappointed and feel as if I have wasted my money purchasing a full year’s subscription.

Water intake, steps, weight tracking are all available in the health app so nice it’s in one space but not novel. 

The exercises aren’t daunting or coming with mega changes to the schedule to be a turn off. 

However, I initially got the app for the meal planning and recipe suggestions. It was (WAS) good, if not great, with a list of all items in the recipes planned for the week, low cal yummy choices picked from a list so I could avoid foods I don’t eat and the ability to switch options at meal time (if day you planned to eat soup but would rather have chicken.). 

BUT the developer decided the variety, options, shopping lists and substitutions were not necessary anymore. I feel like I’m in a box and have no purpose for the app. In trying to change habits and for the two weeks I had the “old” app with the flexible meal plan, I was making progress but the new plan keeps offering fish- which I don’t eat with no options so I’m now standing in front of the fridge trying to decide what to make. There are no longer options, substitutions, or planning tools.

1. The work outs are film separately and then spaced together so you need to be constantly rotating your yoga mat while the person in the videos just flips instantly. This also makes it not feel like you are doing it together 
2. The music is not at all motivating or energetic. It’s really bad elevator music and makes me want to go to sleep.
3. The “custom plan” it gave me (a healthy, fit 45 year old) is for seniors and so very boring. I can pick outer workouts but I can’t find how to reset the 28 day challenge for something appropriate and it’s annoying (and a little insulting). 
4. The “congratulations, you completed the workout” work out screen is a dynamic image that doesn’t let your screen go to sleep so it will drain the battery of your device if you walk away from it. 

All and all, the custom workout plan was a fail, the workouts I can select are still kind of boring and don’t feel effective, the usurper interface is not very well designed and the background music is awful.

2. Voice guidance doesn’t always match to what the trainer is showing :)

6. Sometimes it takes more time to go from one position to another than the duration of the whole exercise

* The water consumption reporting feature is effective and helpful.

-add your own workouts like say I went on a run in the day. Why not have an option to add that to the app? Instead of just completing the workout they choose.
-it must be from the UK or something because a lot of foods you can’t just look up to add to the calorie counter. I have to look up the ounces on everything instead of just coming up what the container is.
- unless you’re eating packaged food all day you have to look up how much each thing is you ate. Like say you had steak, a regular steak is at the very bottom of the list. Or sometimes it’s not even on the list. 
- the calorie ALWAYS adds 3.53 oz of food. Why not make it cups an easy measurement for us to use instead of having to look up how many ounces are in a cup of almonds? Or a cup of popcorn, or a cup of milk.
- was really excited about my “personal” meal plan. When they just think keto is going to work for everyone. Well it’s not. And there is no way to change it. 
Pretty disappointed in the app especially after paying SO MUCH for it.",2,False,Needs work especially because you have to pay for it,b.h..,BetterMe Health Coaching

I have been exercising for about 3 weeks now with the help of a personal trainer and felt like I was making small gains in my strength but not in my flexibility.

So far every exercise I have tried on this app shows a person doing it that is twisting themself into a pretzel, I can barely do a quarter of what they are doing. I don’t understand why the ads are targeted to those who are inflexible only to have no basic videos to show how to do that if you can’t get into a position shown. 

It would be very helpful to have more videos either showing beginners doing the move, or showing how to modify a pose to accommodate less flexibility. It can be very glitchy as well. More talking during the videos would be helpful also. It’s hard to maintain a proper pose and look at what the instructor is doing at the same time.

Workout “plans” are a joke. One day I was doing knee pushups for 8 reps. The next I was doing 6 minutes of continuous pull-ups. I don’t know if any human can do 6 minutes of consecutive pulls ups. I paid for a 12 week “personalized” program out of curiosity which was my own mistake. I wasn’t expecting a coach to show up at my doorstep but it’s obvious they just give everyone pretty much the exact same thing no matter how you answer their little quiz. 

Turns out the personalized 12 week program was just one of those “28 day calisthenics” plans. Once you do 28 days, that’s it lol the remaining 8 weeks, you have the option to repeat the exact same 28 workouts. No progression or incremental increases. 

The app is also device dependent, not account.  So if you’re on day 8 on your iPad, then you travel and try to use your phone the next day for day 9, you can’t do that. This wouldn’t be an issue but the workouts are locked 1 per day and you have to do them in order. That UX is a real head scratcher..

You are not able to change food amounts like if you had a 1/2 serving of something on many of the items. 
You are not able to do more than 1 diet plan if you have allergies like I have a dairy and a gluten allergy yet I can only choose one or the other. 
Menu: the app designers should take into account that when you sign up you probably won’t have all the items for the meals they recommend. They do give you an ingredients list but it would be nice if you could pick the foods that fit you and then be able to  move those ingredients into a shopping list, without having to copy and paste. 
Medical: I realize that these app makers are not doctors or maybe not even nutritionists, and maybe they don’t wish to take responsibility. However they should be able to have enough knowledge to take into account at least the most prevalent medical conditions such as High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, and any Allergies as mentioned before.

I checked other reviews to see how others resolved this problem.

I think I’m going to like it.

There are a few things I’m not sure about or where to get answers.....Is there a website I can go to in order to personalize this a little more for me? Example- 10,000 steps seems to be the default. Can this be changed? I’d also like a way to change the food from ounces to cups, tablespoon, etc. I find I’m using the Calorie tab more than the food tab and would prefer to scan the barcode, put in the number of cups, etc and Calories be accurate. 
With the workouts, how do you change what’s in your lineup each day? 
Last thing - is there a way to batter track ounces of water. They’re pretty round numbers and not accurate to what I’ve had today.

I had already turned on all tracking for health to be synced. But now everything but the “active energy” tab is turned on. And that’s the important one to track my move ring on my watch. 
I’ve turned it on multiple times within the app and within the health app. As soon as I turn all tabs on. I try to view my statistics on the BetterMe app and it’s locked AGAIN. I once again turn on all tabs in health to track/sync and reload the app. Try to see if the statistics updated and LOCKED AGAIN!!

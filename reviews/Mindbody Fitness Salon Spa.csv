My friend Mia introduced me to body heat about a year and a half ago and I fell in love with their cycling classes, then their yoga classes then the boot camp classes.  Every session is amazing thanks to the knowledgeable and motivated teachers they have.  

High energy and very spiritually fulfilling.  I can’t count how many times I’ve gone to Liz’s yoga classes and have been brought to tears by the end because she so effortlessly brings us into our own expressions.  Pings classes will have you crackin up and holding poses all at the same time.  

I could seriously write a book on how amazing every individual there is, if your debating against any other gyms, stop now this is the one, worth every single penny and then some.  The manager also always has a warm welcoming smile on when she’s in studio, she’s even taught a few classes which I think is awesome.

2023-09-13 02:19:40,"Frustrating app- so many bugs/non user friendly designs. You rarely get a response to emails and if you do, it’s often to contact the studio (for example, my cc wasn’t going through so they told me to contact my studio but it was an app issue not a problem with the studio- my studio finally deleted my account and had me resign up and then it worked). 
I originally put my birth name in but changed it to my nickname. I started attending a new studio, and they see my updated name. However, my original studio still sees my birth name. 
They don’t tell you how many classes you have left so if you have a package, you have to count on your own. It also doesn’t tell you your expiration date if you have a monthly package. You can’t sign up for texts in the app. I originally got them but stopped bc it was annoying to get 10 texts right away letting me know that I had just registered for an open class at the beginning of each month. However, now I don’t get a text when I get into a waitlisted class. There should be an option to only get texts when you get into a waitlisted class or if a class in cancelled. 
They also don’t allow for discounts. My studio offers a teacher discount, but I have to ask them anytime I need to change my number of classes, instead of doing it through the app.
My instructors also complain about it- I wish my studios would get another scheduling app.",2,False,Tess1082,Frustrating,,Mindbody Fitness Salon Spa

I downloaded it hoping that logging in my 3 children into Burn Boot Camp child-watch would be easier than trying to use the non-mobile web browser from my phone. Unfortunately, I’ll still have to do the annoying process of zooming in and out on the browser. I have to go through that same process four times to get us each logged in. Because in the app you can only press the “book” button once it  leaves my two other children unable to attend. 
There needs to be a drop down menu so a number can be chosen. Same with the web browser. It doesn’t bother me that I have to zoom in and out. The biggest issue is I have to go through an annoying process 4 times, every single day. I’m a busy mom I don’t have time to sit and mess with that.
I think the real issue is that the developer didn’t develop the app to be used in the way my gym intended for child care sign up to function.

Or bring my own lock? 2 - app should have 3-4 photos of every studio. Mandatory photos supplied by studio should be the fitness room and the facilities (locker room, showers etc). A lot of studios in nyc have grimy, small and terrible shower setups. People need to see the shower facilities in advance.  3 - when I move to the map view, you show me every business on the app. You should show me ONLY what is in my filters. For example a yoga class between 6-8 am. Don’t show me hair salons when I’m looking for fitness. Then I can use the map to pick one in a location that allows me to get to work by 9 am

- Calendar Syncing: events over three weeks out show up in the app but don't sync with my calendar. Not sure why they would not sync as soon as they are scheduled in the app. Have tried a lot of troubleshooting and it seems like a flaw.
- Calendar Syncing: another issue is that sometimes the same class will show up twice in my calendar, OR WON'T SHOW UP AT ALL. I have to force close the MindBody app to re-sync and appear as they should.

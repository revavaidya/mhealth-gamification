The app itself is very helpful for a complete newbie such as myself. I appreciate the ability to see how the different machines work via videos found by using QR codes on the machines. I also like the ability to use the membership card on the app - though, for some reason I’ve got to figure, it does not work on my Apple Watch. 

The one place I really, really hope the app developers fix is the ability to add the exercises one engages in. For example: today I did arm curls, bicep curls, front fly, chest press, hammer curl, and up/down/oblique abdominals. Not a single one of these exercise are listed in the “add an activity” section of the app. Why on earth wouldn’t you have each machine you have in your gym listed on your app? Please consider adding in the ability to list the machines used, the weights used, and time spent (or even reps) along with the other information you allow currently. 

Being able to add these is will more accurately reflect my actual “mins of exercise”, “activities this week”, “calories burned”, and “mins per active day”.",4,False,A nonymous76,"Good, but could be better.",Planet Fitness Workouts

I would go try to work out and they just stand there staring at you and kept asking if I was done, when I had just gotten the equipment after waiting my turn. Planet Fitness has tons of equipment TONS and there’s always something available to do. Not to mention the levels of membership ranging from $10, $12 and $21 which is the Black Card Membership that allows me to use the gym on my way home from work and the one by my house on the weekends. Plus not only that but the Black Card Room with tanning booths, total body enhancing booth and hydro massage with massage chairs. I love it, there are no pushy trainers,  No body builders, just average me and average others who have the same goals in mind, lose weight and get healthy. Would I recommend Planet Fitness to those who are intimidated by the big gym, yes I would. The only thing I miss is Body Pump class but I remedied that with my own body pump setup at home. The staff is nice and everyone has to wipe down their equipment after use with cleaner provided every where, even Monk would be impressed.

Unbelievably, my worst fear confirmed, the app no longer has the “treadmill” option, and they have also “discontinued” the snap a workout feature. That feature was so helpful for me tracking my fitness history. 

But ok, I have to enter manually now, I could reluctantly accept that. Then I learned that to add insult to injury, you can only use the “walking” option as the closest thing to treadmill, and there you can only log your speed and minutes, not your calories or incline. From reading reviews, I learned the super buried feature where if you enter your height and weight, it will calculate the calories, however without the incline info, the calculation is way off. 

Friends, I feel bad saying this but this update is *terrible* — I have never regretted updating an app on this level. The old version was ugly, but it was super useful, and i used it a lot for a very important part of my life. The new version is useless to me.

You can take a picture of the elliptical, treadmill, or bike screen and it will log the numbers for you.  You can post your workouts to social media and link it to a variety of other apps.  Post a picture to their success stories section and you might win a TV.  I have my membership card linked to it, so it scans from the app and I don’t have to carry the card.  This is handy for everything from buying a drink to reserving a massage chair.

The reason I gave it 4 stars was Planet Fitness’s 30 Minute Express workout.  I like the workout.  The app has videos for all of it.  The app won’t log the workout.

Planet fitness is a great place to come work out. It’s got plenty of room so you have space to work out instead of feeling cramped. They have a huge amount of cardio machines so you’re never waiting for one to free up, which is one of my favorite parts. They have this cool area that’s kinda for people who aren’t sure what to do during a workout, you just follow the routine and you’re set. It’s also great for people who don’t have a lot of time to workout. My favorite part is the “ Black Card Spa” area. There are massage chairs and beds, a tanning booth, and also body enhancement machines. Cool part of being a black card member is that you’re able to bring anyone at any time for free, and it’s still cheaper than any other gym around.

A couple exercises allow you to input a more realistic metric here (like miles per hour for running) but most are vague and useless in terms of calculating any kind of calorie burn or whatever other goal you have set for yourself. 

Until they actually take their app seriously, I recommend using something else. 

Suggestions for improvement, CAPTURE THE METRICS FROM THE MACHINE, no brainer right? People aren’t coming to Planet Fitness to play lacrosse or ice hockey (they are in the list of activities, not kidding) so remove the fluff from your list. Lastly, add a general food diary. It doesn’t have to be super complicated with a massive collection of foods to search, just make it so foods can be added and saved to be easily used again later. People going to the gym often pay attention to this stuff and are willing to eat the same things regularly to see the gains they want.

I signed up without having the in person tour so I was surprised when I found out there was no bench press or squat racks or any free bar weights of any kind really. I also had problems with the gym being packed most of the time with the exceptions of Friday nights and weekends which every gym usually empties out on. 

The final thing that got me is that I found out I have access to a program called active fit through USAA because I’m a service member. That plan allows my to pick 5 gyms for $25 a month so I went with that and needed to cancel my member ship as I would still have planet fitness through the new program. I searched the app and searched online and couldn’t find any way to cancel. I called and was told I would have to come in to switch my membership to the active fit account or to cancel. I find it very annoying that I can sign up online at home but have to come into the store in person to cancel. I see that as shady tactics designed to prevent you from canceling or to make it difficult so they get you for a few more billing cycles. Either way I think I’ll be moving forward with a different gym and I encourage everyone else to do the same.

My only complaint is that the Activity Tracker does not have the actual gym equipment and gym exercises listed, apart from cardio. For a perfect app and experience, I would appreciate if the developers would consider adding the machine workouts to the list of activities. This would create a more accurate “mins of exercise,” and would more accurately account for burned calories.

Other apps  had me click the link when I was ready to start my post pandemic subscription again. This GUARANTEES that I’m okay with the charges. Planet fitness just starts taking money out of my account without telling me. 

When I called the guy told me “sorry but we got your money now”. And chuckles. That made me furious.  He told me to I have to come in to cancel my membership which I didn’t wanna do. So I never came in to cancel but he cancelled it anyway. Then when I go to work out they said he wrote that I was a “rude customer” in their notes.

There’s a blink fitness that just opened up next to my house… they are quoting the PF guy on the phone now. “Sorry but we(blink) got your(my gym membership money)money now”. PF becareful who you hire.

ORIGINAL:
The newest version of the app took away the one thing I was actually using it for, tracking distances of my various workouts. 

Now when you record a workout all you are entering is the time. There is no field to enter distance. So all the entries I had for the entire year, leading up to when it silently updated on my phone are now lost. 

Additionally, when you do enter the time of your workout, it defaults the Calories calculation (which is ALWAYS much lower than what the specific machine calculated) but no longer gives you a way to override the calculation. Previously you could override it with what was displayed on the machine. 

Also there is no way to see summaries of previous months/year to date/... beyond the current month (August as of this review). 

Because of this change the only thing I will prob end up using the app for is to display my ID card to get in the door. 

As a software developer I appreciate the need for updates but not when you take away basic functionality that people might be using.

Unfortunately, this 380 calories is recorded as a fraction by the apple health app; therefore, it is interpreted as less than one calorie burned in 55 minutes. 

It is recorded as .38(point three eight), not even a calorie burned in one hour.

It is the responsibility of Planet Fitness to initiate contact with Apples app developement team to collaborate on resolving this issue.

2. Include Planet Perks inside the app. It makes sense to me, maybe under the profile button, to have a tab or area that tells you how many planet perk points you have earned. 

3. For the different exercises that you can log, can we change the data on non-cardio exercises, so that it doesn’t log minutes spent, but sets and reps instead? It doesn’t make much sense to log the amount of minutes I spent bench pressing, instead of the sets and reps.

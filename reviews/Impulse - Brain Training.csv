After coming across Impulse, I figured I would give it a go. I have just completed the 30-day brain workout plan and feel real improvement now: it becomes easier for me to concentrate on the particular task and my working memory seems to be better as well. Not sure whether the same may be fully related to the use of this app, but I don’t care as long as I see results. I have bought the lifetime plan and consider this as a huge investment in my mental health.
Planning to start a new workout but not sure whether to go for 30 or for 10 days. It would be great to see some recommendations after finishing the 30-day plan.
Also, I enjoy solving brain-teasers a lot. Just a small suggestion here - would be really interesting to see how other players answered to brain-teasers.
The only thing I wish this app have is more training areas, like creativity, brain speed, etc. Also would appreciate more games and exercises (still, worth to mention that the developer adds new content regularly).

I've spent many weeks reading about brain training & cognitive performance over the past year, and specifically about boosting memory, attention, and retention.

Let me tell you, this app is what was missing from my daily life. I couldn't always train my brain when at work or university; that always ended in mental burnout. However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind. 

The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment. 

I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability. I wish the premium version was free so that I'd make full use of this app. 

With that being said, keep up Impulse!",5,False,Mmmmm,Zayn Sami,Impulse - Brain Training

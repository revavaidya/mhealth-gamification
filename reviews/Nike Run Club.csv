I started using this app to track my progress in my weight loss journey. My runs are only a mile and a half each day, for the time being, so I haven't experienced any issues that the other reviews have pointed out concerning crashes. I love the achievement section and how you are able to log miles on the sneakers you are running in. There are only two things that keep me from giving this a 5 star rating. First has to do with the music. I have plenty of music on my iTunes, but I prefer to listen to Pandora. Maybe I haven't fidgeted with the app enough, but I haven't found any way to set Pandora as my music preference. It would be nice to be able to do that. Secondly, I use the timer on my phone to track my time because I time myself running run way. Once that time is up, I turn around and run back. The problem is when my timer goes off, my workout pauses. Again, I haven't fidgeted with the app too much, so I don't know if a workout like that is available. I just don't like that my workout pauses just because my timer that isn't even part of the app goes off. Both of those are small issues that I have adjusted to, but the app would have five stars from me if those issues were not there.",5,False,Great for what I need,Chels3423,,Nike Run Club
2023-08-04 01:39:28,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong! I love using this app so much! It makes tracking my runs so much easier, and is super convenient to use. However, there are some things I think could make the app even better. One of them is the tracking. I love that when I‚Äôm looking back on my past runs I can see where I‚Äôve run before, but I think it would also be helpful to be able to plan routes as well. Since it already has the gps, you could just draw out a route following the streets, or you could type in however many miles you want to run, and it could find possible routes or trails near you to try. I personally think that this could make this app even better and more convenient than it already is. I also think it would be fun to ‚Äúremix a run,‚Äù if you were to redo a run you‚Äôve already done, and it could guide you to take the same route, and then you could try to beat your past time or something like that. It would also be nice to have almost a shopping tab where it would be personalized to your runs and the activity you‚Äôve done, and it could have recommendations for different shoes or Nike clothes that would be best for you depending on where, and how much effort you do when you run. None of these are fixes to problems or anything, but rather just things that would make your app even better. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a nice day!!!

2022-05-29 04:03:29,"I‚Äôm really impressed with the coaching available as part of the app. I picked up running recently and had started tracking runs in Strava. I decided to check out NRC because a friend of mine is using it and referenced it. I‚Äôm sure glad that I did! Previously I would just go out and run hard. But it‚Äôs hard to motivate for that kind of pain. I decided to try NRC‚Äôs 10k program to give me something to work toward. It has me doing speed runs, recovery runs, longer distances, etc. As a new runner, it has made running accessible and even kinda fun.
My problem is with the app itself. My 10k program from Nike is a PDF and it says which ‚ÄúGuided Run‚Äù I should do in the app. It begs the question why isn‚Äôt the program itself in the app? Failing that I should at least be able to search the guided runs for the name provided. But, no. So that‚Äôs why 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è.
It seems like they could do so much more with this app too. The coach doesn‚Äôt know my pace so can only say the level of effort I should put in. But the app does! It doesn‚Äôt seem like it would have to be very sophisticated AI to customize the training plan to me. Age should be considered too. As a 50-something I‚Äôm just not going to build strength and stamina at the same rate as a younger runner. 
In short, I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm using the app. You should definitely download it and give it a try. AND there is still a lot of opportunity for it to grow and improve.",4,False,Fantastic Coaching,Morp/-/eus,,Nike Run Club

Sometimes when I go for a run, my screen goes dark and I can‚Äôt access my run, and the only way to stop my run is to remember where the buttons are, this is a good bug to be fixed in this app. Another bug to be fixed is sometimes when I run on the treadmill, and input my run, it doubles that runs mileage on the leaderboards.

I also really liked the coaching tab that had coaching for beginners, strength building, and for racing. I started out with coaching for beginners, then went to coaching for strength, and then coaching for my first half marathon race. Fast forward five years now, and I‚Äôve outgrown the app because they‚Äôve taken away the coaching for racing that adapts to your runs automatically. Now the coaching is ‚Äúcanned‚Äù, static, and does not adjust to the runner. Also, I‚Äôd like to sync my runs to running community apps, like Strava. However, the Nike Run Club app doesn‚Äôt sync to anything which makes it hard to share my progress with friends and my local running groups. Nike Run Club doesn‚Äôt have any running clubs in my area. They are only in the biggest of cities. For this reason I gave Nike Run Club app three stars. I would be happy to give it more stars if they brought back the adaptable coaching and allowed the app to sync with other apps. It does sync to Apple Health, but Apple Health won‚Äôt easily export all the run data, like splits, intervals/laps, etc. Apple Health only exports summary run data to other apps. Nike Run Club needs to build a direct integration to popular running community apps so all the run data can be viewed and analyzed in those apps.",3,False,"Great for Beginners, Not So Much for Experienced",BeansandBananas,,Nike Run Club
2022-05-19 22:21:59,"I initially downloaded NRC when I joined a sports team because our summer workouts required us to send a few screenshots of runs in a run tracker app. I had always hated running, but was so surprised at how easy Nike Run Club made it. I quickly found myself feeling like I could tackle an extra mile or two after the required distance, and then one day I decided to try one of the guided runs. I was shocked at how motivating it was to have someone in my ear the whole run telling me I was doing great, keep it up, they‚Äôre proud of me, etc. I got so hooked and am glad to say that 2 years later I‚Äôm training for my first half marathon (next week!) 
That being said, I know a lot of my friends who ran XC in high school prefer Strava, but as someone who is just getting into running as an adult, I find Nike Run Club a lot more user-friendly and easier to digest. And this app never glitches out on me, and has all of the tools I could need as a newbie runner.

I‚Äôm disappointed because I like the guided runs and training plans the app offers but I can no longer overlook it‚Äôs other issues. I have an Apple Watch series 3 and it is nearly impossible to sync my runs between my watch and phone. Lately any run that I start from my watch is deleted which is especially annoying with speed runs in which it is much easier to start and stop intervals from my watch. I‚Äôve lost my running streaks because of this inability to sync and any adaptability in my training plans. When runs are started from my phone my watch fails to sync and provide useful stats throughout or after the run. As I said previously, I love that the app offers free training programs for various goals. I used one of these to train for my first half marathon. However, I do have a few gripes. I understand that incorporating Nike Training Club workouts into plans gives both apps use, but it is difficult when you already have a plan on the NTC app. It would be nice to have the option to exclude these workouts from training plans or link your current NTC workouts. It would also be super useful to allow for the training plans to be customizable. Plenty of other apps already offer this feature.

When you want to go on a run you can set a speed goal, a distance goal, or a timer for how long you will run. This helps for various reasons with different types of runs. The one issue I have been having with this app is that it doesn‚Äôt track my speed/distance/location as accurately as it should. I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes when I try faster paces and take the same route I usually do I find myself running farther than I should (passing the one mile point and still having .05 miles left on the app).

A few things I wish they‚Äôd improve on:
1. Explaining their workouts a little. For example today I needed to run 4 intervals of 400m however I just had the workout going the entire time in between. I wasn‚Äôt informed that I needed to pause the workout in between intervals so by the time I was done it looked like I only completed 1 interval.
2. There are still some glitches they need to work through. There have been multiple times when I‚Äôve gotten on the app and gone to where my ‚Äúcoach‚Äù should be for my 10k training and nothing is there so all of my training has disappeared and there‚Äôs no evidence of it ever happening. Typically if I exit the app and try again 30 mins later my training will show up again.

The training plans have also been really helpful for me because they make it easy to just get out and run and not really stress about planning, pace, effort, progress, etc. They get you where you need/want to go as you run. They also track a bunch of metrics for you so you don‚Äôt have to bother with keeping track of it yourself.

The design flaw: used to when you had HIIT days where you ran 7 200 meter sprints with 2:45 minute breaks (for example), you hit ‚Äúpause‚Äù after you completed the interval and it started counting your break time so you knew exactly when you needed to start again.

I started the run in the watch waited for the count down and stared running. Good 7 or 8 mins into my run I check the watch only to find the watch showing me the time as though I didn‚Äôt start.

Luckily it didn‚Äôt stop after 3k. 
I lost 0.7 mile of the tracking. Lost my rhythm on run. Ended up running more than my goal(ok that‚Äôs fine) but dealing with a buggy app in the middle of the run is super frustrating.

I‚Äôve become a more serious runner and started using a Series 3 Apple Watch to run. For a while everything worked great but I found that sometimes I would look down at my watch to check my stats and it wouldn‚Äôt actually be tracking me at all even tho I know I started the run. Or I would pause the app and it would glitch and erase my run as I never was running. The issue that recurred the most would be I would finish my run and try to synch it to my phone and it would glitch and the run would be lost. I always keep my app updated and I‚Äôm currently (March 2020) using the newest products from Apple (watch and phone). I‚Äôve tried many times to work around the issue. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app...I disconnect from WiFi before I start. Nothing seems to work. After years of praising this app I can‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs discouraging to have a great run just for it to be lost. I‚Äôve started just using the activity app on the watch itself and it works great!

I‚Äôm disappointed the My Coach feature isn‚Äôt available on my Watch (Series 3 GPS), nor does my running activity (history) show up in the NRC app on my Watch. I‚Äôm also disappointed that the NRC complication on my Watch is useless because the Last Run & Next Run information doesn‚Äôt sync from the iPhone app. Please add My Coach functionality to the Watch app as soon as possible.

The app crashes / doesn‚Äôt track runs 100% of the time. I‚Äôve had to restart Audio Guided Runs from My Coach multiple times because it crashes a few minutes into my run.

It was saying I had run my first mile several hundred feet before the 1 mile marker on the course. I just assumed it would balance out in time.
But by the time I crossed the 10 mile mark on the course my app said I had already run 13 miles! Wow! That really messed with my head during the race. I realized that not only was my pace way off what I thought it should be but I also realized I had never run even 10 miles during my training runs! Fortunately I am strong mentally and was able to finish. When I crossed the finish line my watch said I had run 16.6 miles, 3.5 miles further than the official distance! That is an average of 0.26 miles ahead per mile!! This is very frustrating to say the least. I thought that with the name Nike I was getting the best running app out there!

One very annoying thing in the latest versions is the updated speed run interval mode. First of all, it is not intuitive at all. Should you hit lap and then pause? Lap before rest and not pause? Lap after rest? If you pause, how are you supposed to track rest time?

Not only is it annoying, but is a major step down from previous versions of the app, where you had a distinct timed rest feature that was super intuitive, easy to use (just one button to rest and then restart) and very useful. You had a good thing going, why did you change it? Please bring the one-button timed rest feature back!!

Treadmill use: It doesn‚Äôt track your distance so well. I think it assumes your average rate, and then plugs it in what it thinks you have done. The bad side of that is if you try to fix the distance by matching it up to the treadmill in the end, it won‚Äôt count your mileage for any of your challenges. Kind of a waste.
Running outside: Occasional glitching. Most common is the tracking of a distance. I run a specific trail regularly. Approximately 100 times. It usually measures out at 3.24 to 3.25 miles. Other times it‚Äôs 3.19. Not that big of a deal, but if you edit the run to account for the missing distance at all, it will erase the entire run. A bit irritating.

Improvements needed:

1) Clear description of a workout before it starts. For example, it is important to understand if one needs to find (drive to) a hill to before starting running,

2) leaderboard on watch

3) Some coaches are really bad in explaining the workout. One told that the workout is like a hill where we turn in the middle and run back down. Described first speed as 4/10 (that is easy to understand), but after that all sections were little faster. Apparently after half-point the speed continued to be little faster. How about using x/10 effort for each part and telling ahead of time that speed increases throughout the workout. 

Bugs critical to fix:

1) If I play music and happens to say ""hey siri, next"" just when nike app starts speaking, it disables the guidance for the rest of the workout. Ruining the whole run. (I have Apple Watch Ultra, LTE, if that matters)

2) workout sync to phone (NRC app) is unreliable. One sometimes needs to restart the app.

After multiple iterations, amazingly Nike continues to make their app worse.

Incredibly sluggish to start, seriously should it really take at least three tries and over 30 seconds to get it started every time????
This ‚Äúfeature‚Äù makes the app nearly worthless for races.

How is it even possible that Nike took a perfectly useful app and made it so frustrating  and useless that every day you want to delete it?

And what‚Äôs up with deleting the website?  Making the app sluggish and unresponsive  wasn‚Äôt enough damage?   Nike figures that no serious runner keeps track of their stats, so there‚Äôs no need to maintain the web access.

Wow... where to start?    I've used Nike+ for more than eight years.   It's had its ups and downs but has been generally useful for keeping track of runs.   This new iteration has inexplicably made a useful app completely and utterly useless.   For those of us using an iPod Touch (no gps) the app is not capable of calculating accurate mileages.  And here's the really inexplicable part, they removed (removed?!?) the recalibration function that has been part of the software since its beginning.    Are you kidding me?!?  This function is ABSOLUTELY essential in running software!!!  You took it off so you could put more social media crap that runners will never use on your app?  Great move.

notes are back (thank you!) and the new design is really nice. I‚Äôve just switched to iPhone X and it was a pleasant surprise that the app is already optimized for it.

With that being said, I turned it on and started running, as always, but as I wasn‚Äôt listening to the feedback I set it up after a few minutes, I checked and as I unlocked my phone, the countdown started again, time was running from when I originally started but the distance was not.

Hopefully the massive amounts of poor reviews will have a positive effect on the upcoming updates. I don't think we could be any louder about how disappointing the new app is.

The social media aspect is overwhelming, the badges - which were a big source of motivation for me - were taken away, and the calibration seems off since all of a sudden my pace is way higher than it used to be for no reason.

What I came here to complain about is the awful distance measurements. I run the exact same run several times a week with very little variance in route(same side of the road). My mileage results are sometimes as much as a quarter mile off. This is obviously not practical at all as that can be a huge difference when running 3-6 mile distances.

So in other words I was actually running faster the 2nd day, but I didn‚Äôt realize that until I went into the app and dissected the information.

1) Integrated warmups and cool downs from the Nike Training Club app - make the run less of an hassle by having to switch from app to app. Without nudges for proper warm ups and cool downs, beginners are setting themselves for an injury at some point.

2) make the colors of the display during a run customizable. Dark blue digits in a bright sunny day makes keeping your pace very difficult.

3) ability to share runs to Strava - it is undeniable that the running community is a part of Strava. As perfect as the guided runs are, there is a social element missing in this app. Nike better create one (super hard when there is an established one already), or join the fray.

You can‚Äôt start a guided run on the iphone and have it pick up data from the watch. It appears that all the run data comes from the phone itself. 

Some guided runs started on the iPhone cause the watch app to crash, which in turn causes an iPhone crash, which loses the run. 

Pro tip: if you start it on the watch, stay with the watch, and vice versa. But don‚Äôt expect the other device to care about your hard work.

However it has serious shortcomings that make it only a mediocre program. 

1. Swipe, Scroll to pause and end a run. Too many steps, buttons are small rectangles?? Should be one large button, no swiping . If a person wants more options like pause, that should involve swiping. Try swiping 50 times and you will also wonder why it functions like this. 

2. Buttons are sluggish especially on older watches. This means you think you have paused your run, but in reality you have not and the battery continues to drain. 

3. Unable to force-quit the app on my watch, which means the battery drains more and more and I cannot stop it.

2021-01-04 01:15:10,"Guys,
You can fix this mess without the need to throw away your new work.

By now, with old the negative feedback to the latest version, you should understand that the Coach section is the problem.

We earthlings don't have answers to questions like how many miles we want to run or opportunities to exercise per week we have. 

Therefore the solution is very simple:

1) Within Coach, create ""Earthlings"" and ""Pros"" sections
2) In ""Pros"", throw in all the new development for Coach. We get it: there are gals and guys that clearly  want those options.
3) In ""Earthlings"", bring back the old Coach. No more, no less.

Is that simple. 

Please, DO NOT try to combine options of the new with the old Coach.

In the future, for the ""Earthlings"" section, you may add 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, all the way to 100K programs.

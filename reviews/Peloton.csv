The  apple store manager said that the iwatch I had could not be updated any longer when apple rolled out updates because it was to old and this could have been causing the issues with the peloton app.  Since I upgraded my watch and bought a new phone everything has been working.  So I am not sure it was the peloton app that was not working properly or the fact that apple was again making it so old phones and watches were not working with some apps so I am changing my rating to better reflect my experience. 

The app still crashes with outdoor workouts sometimes right away sometimes in the middle of the run or walk. This is frustrating and a waste of time having to stop and restart from the beginning. How can a company this big not have an IT team that can fix this! The metrics for the running and walking program for when you walk inside that synced with the watch used to calculate distance nope not anymore! Please fix this and no I don’t need to contact you again I’ve done it serval times and all the troubleshooting you all had me do did not fix the issue. Frustrating when you are tying to keep track of your milage. Please Fix this. Your last update didn’t…ugh use to be a great app.",5,True,D M A 12,Update did not fix Crashes and metrics,Peloton

However I really only use that to monitor a heart rate in my sleep quality and a half and other other things I don’t use it for the work out because the workouts on that app just didn’t interest me for some reason I guess is the best way to say it. However I’ve worked outA couple what time is very regularly using this peloton app the workouts are fun, they’re just the right difficulty, and I think it’s a little clearer to follow because it’s really just in the videos just the instructor. It’s not like you’re in a whole class which I kind of found distracting with the other app so you feel that it’s just you and the instructor with one on one which is really great. The boxing workouts that I’ve done are excellent and they make you sweat. I just finished an ab workout that was only five minutes and it was it was very very difficult but that’s great because that’s something that I want to work on. Overall I got to say it’s a great app you’re gonna love it you’re going to get some great workouts in you’re going to continuously use it as I will. My one why would the app I guess is sometimes the music is a little bit distracting because I think it’s just a little bit too loud but I I think there’s a way to mediate that. I also just meditated using this app and the meditations are nice the calming perfect so all in all it’s a really really good app that I think you will get your moneys worth out of",4,False,Hulkfan68,Very good,Peloton

Old review:
I guess the utility of the app depends upon your goals. If your goal is heart rate training (HRT), or some sort of high intensity fitness training, there are better videos on You Tube. If your goal is to pass the time with a certain type of music, and get ""life coaching"" from a yoga teacher, then this app will work for you. I found Steve Little to be the best, most serious instructor. I found Nicole Meline to be one I wanted to mute as she offered empty platitudes like ""make yourself essential"", ""paint a new masterpiece today"", ""you don't have to accept that inheritance"". Huh? I'm looking to work hard and get my heart rate up to 90-93% That isn't a goal of this program. Apparently, helping the depressed is. What they need to do to cater to serious fitness folks: get some graphics on the screen: heart rate as a percent of maximum; cadence; resistance,; effort level; segment time; total time. Instead, you're gonna get ""favorite playlists"". That's fine for the Lululemon yoga pants in the grocery store ""athlete"", but how about something for the serious folks? They clearly have the technology. For me, it's back to You Tube videos.  I'll check back in six months. Maybe they'll come around.",5,False,loanflyer,Vast improvement from original app,Peloton

In regards to the actual app: Positive = all the filters you can use to search though the enormous amount of classes and find the specific one you’re looking for. The classes vary greatly in skills and the instructors are great. They do everything they can to make working out enjoyable. Negative = I use the meditation specifically for relaxation and sleep. It works great and I actually fall asleep while doing the video. This is a problem because it wants you to rate at the end and if you don’t, the phone does not lockout (like every other app) and continues to run. This is a huge problem since I woke up this morning with my phone EXTREMELY hot. I don’t even feel safe using it. Also, it could have killed my battery if not on the charger and caused major problems with no alarm. I’ve also noted that the app is not able to load far more than I would like. Jokes have been all over social media about it crashing during times of highly popular classes, but even during times when no live clases are happening the classes are sometimes not available. This is makes it really tough to stay dedicated to a workout regimen when you can’t count on being able to do the work when you’ve carved time out for it.

2020-05-29 18:27:18,,"I have been a Peloton bike user (in my building gym) for a year and a half.  I was doing workouts 5 days/wk. When the COVID-19 crisis started unfolding. As many things started changing the directive to close gyms came to fruition & my building complied and closed our gym facilities. 
I knew I’d be able to “deal” with the changes put into place however, one thing that really annoyed me was that I’d have to stop my 5 day a week habit that I have painstakinly made part of my daily week day regimen.  I did not want to break this habit. 
This is where this app came in!  Peloton brilliantly extended a 90 day trial for their app. I am hooked!  I plan on keeping my membership and plan to incorporate it into my routine. I have been able to keep up with workouts from the same people who I have grown to love and more.  While, its not the cycling part I was able to seamelssly continue a workout routine.  Once things start to reopen I will go back to cycling but I definitely will want the other workouts that were not currenty part of using the gym bike. 
I love the variety of workouts, instrutors, playlists...one thing I would love to see is an ability to create a workout “playlist”.

I love the ranges provided so you can measure profession by taking the same class, the instructors are inspiring, the user experience is sleek and uncomplicated. I too would love to be able to interact with my contacts a bit more (get notifications of them finishing workouts etc.) and see if they signed up for the same live classes - there is a sense of community already but I think it could be built on. As an app user, I’d love the ability to rate the workouts after I complete them to more easily return to the ones I enjoyed most. Personally a bit more information on the run itself would be useful I.e 4 min work up, followed by 3 min sprint intervals followed by 3 mins hill intervals etc. But these are minor points - I have already converted 5+ friends to the app and am thinking of getting the treadmill itself because I love the whole idea so much! #teampeloton",5,False,Minter81,Subscription fitness at its best!,Peloton

I can’t tell you how great a resource this has been for me and my fitness journey. When I can’t motivate myself to go to the gym or get outside for a walk, it’s easy to talk myself into a 20 minute workout in my own living room. I feel stronger and I’m learning so much. The instructors are super fun and informative and as a beginner in most fitness activities, I’ve been loving the different program offerings for beginners. I’m currently in the middle of the beginner strength training program. 

I took off a star only because it’s a bit of a pain to get to my program workouts on my Roku app. There’s no place for me to see what programs I’m enrolled in or what classes I need to take next. So every time I want to do a program workout on my tv, I have to start it on my phone, pause it, then find the workout on my “recent classes” list. If there could be another easier way to navigate the programs on my tv, that would be amazing and I’d raise my rating to five stars!

Similar to what I was used to in CrossFit and in fighting. Peloton has built a wonderful platform that everyone feels welcome. I also didn’t count on the amazing content that this app has.

My issue and why I am taking off stars is bc as of recently(maybe past couple months it seems?)the live classes are buggier than ever. The app tells me I don’t have a subscription when I go to join from my homepage. I have to then click in from my scheduled classes to access the class. Once I’m in, my HR is not displayed and it’s typically cutting out portions of the classes(more than a typical amount)since this bug started.

Not the biggest thing but I expect the classes to load to my watch rings.. it doesn’t count those cals anymore.

While I appreciate that they warn you if the video is explicit it doesn’t help when they’re almost ALL explicit with no way to filter out the bad language. I’d like the instructors to buy a thesaurus and use cleaner language. Never heard so much swearing by instructors in any fitness app I’ve tried. It’s the only reason I probably won’t be purchasing after free trial ends. The video editors could bleep out some of the bad words but don’t seem to care. If you have kids then les mills tv app is superior. They too offer cycling workout videos. The peloton workouts are good but I have to watch them on silent with subtitles when my young child is awake and play my own music. The frequent swearing ruins this otherwise great app. My other gripe is the lack of a pause button. Les mills has it so why not add it to peloton videos? All our kids are home due to the pandemic and not being able to pause it when they enter the room is a huge problem. These are not family friendly workouts which is too bad since son no longer gets PE in school. If you’d remove all the swearing kids could use them for home PE purposes with us.

I really really need to see the playlist on the app because music is an important part of a ride. Second, I’d also like to see my achievement badges on the app. Third, it would be great to see side by side comparisons of output/cadence/resistance with connections who have completed the same ride. Fourth, it would be interesting to think about sending push notifications when your connections finish a ride - I love giving my friends kudos when they complete rings on the Apple Watch.

So if you get sick, or if anything else comes up that takes you out of the game for more than a day (and I type this as I’m feeling I’ll and knowing I won’t be up for working out for at least a few days), you’re out of luck, and those classes just get skipped. Even if you do them later, it doesn’t count. And if you’re doing a program that’s more than just two to three days a week, you’ll never catch up. Anyway, I’m a big fan of programs. I’m not an athlete, I’m not a trainer, so I like to have someone tell me what to do and when, but I really wish this app allowed for some life to get in. Alternatively, my preference would be to not timebox programs at all. Nike doesn’t, why does peloton need to?

Older classes do just fine for tracking mileage.

1. They ignore a large market - not everyone is their 20’s, 30’s or 40’s. There are very fit people in their 50’s, 60’s, 70’s and even 80’s who would love the app but the music selection is slim pickings.

2. seeing the full breakdown of the class (currently “2m warmup 17m intervals 1m cool down — lets break out that 17m intervals into detail)
3.  introducing an easy way to compare my performance when I repeat a class
4. Long term tracking, maybe a kj/minute output trend line or rating per class taken would be a helpful view to track increased performance over time
5. Splitting teacher/music audio, in a few classes I can barely make out what the teacher is saying because the music is too loud. Or a text hover of the teachers’ instruction somewhere on screen (4% and 6-8mph)

This is a known and well discussed and worn topic of concern for users in many chat rooms and platforms. I caught it on my local radio station the other day, where a guest aired Peloton as ‘disturbing,  creating anxiety and impeding my workout’. 

I strongly encourage that consumers take advantage of the free trial and determine in advance the acceptable background music and/or busy chatter that trainers chose or given as an outline. In this regard I don’t feel a single star rating captures the extent of dissatisfaction. I look forward to this changing and will opt for a subscription at that time.

I purchased a bike and now have the all access membership. I am disappointed with the Peloton membership practices. 

The all access membership needed for the bike comes with access to the app. I was originally paying for the app through Apple and did not realize that I would need to cancel the original app subscription when upgrading to the all access membership for my bike. Peloton can clearly see the different active memberships of their customers. Although I am now paying for the all access membership (which again includes the app), peloton continued to allow me to also pay for the app separately. 

This seems like a sketchy double dipping business practice and Peloton should do more to notify or explain this to customers. I understand the billing is through Apple so cancelations need to be made with Apple directly. However, Peloton is being paid by Apple for the app subscriptions and is responsible for their customers. Peloton should do more to inform customers when this is happening and when updating subscriptions. It feels that they are using Apple as a scapegoat to take two payments for the same thing from customers.

Good:
Music and class energy of many trainers is fantastic. I used my Bose speaker and I could feel the energy

Bad:
The App is not for cyclist trying to find some home training app. The App does. It support power meters and you cannot really setup your training based on power or training zones.

The trainers have good energy and keep the class interesting, but it is impossible to follow the work out. For example, you hear them screaming Go Go Go and I was like go what? 30 seconds sprint at 120? Training zone 3, 4 ? Power at 75% your FTP?? What? For how long? 20 secs? 30 secs? Whaaaat????? What is the goal? 

If you are not a performance oriented cyclist then it is awesome because of the music, but if you have used Apps like Sufferfest for example, you will find this App very uninterested.

My feedback:

change the App GUI to make it easier to follow the workout targets
Include power meter support from Wahoo for example
Train your trainers to comunícate clear goals: sprint for 20 sec! Keep cadence for 3 mins. Reach Zone 3 ! Go to 110% your FTP for 2 mins.... etc etc. Be clear on what is the goal because when you are pushing hard your mind starts going places and it helps when the trainer keeps you focus.

The body activity is an interesting addition, but it has so much more potential.

The proportions are going to be slow to change and it’ll be hard to notice chnages for some muscle groups.  I’ll probably lose interest soon.

But if you could use the same data to show a measure for each muscle that shows how recent it was worked and whether I’ve given enough time for it to recover, then I would keep using this indefinitely.  Or give us a way to get the data so we can use other apps to do this.

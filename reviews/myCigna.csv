When I first downloaded the app it worked however I got a new iPhone in November. My old iPhone had a touchID and my new iPhone has faceID.

I was called this morning and was told that my eligibility was confirmed and my insurance card was on the My Cigna app. Not true. There was a card online but it was populated with out of date information. I discovered this at Walgreens after waiting in line and being told that the BIN and PCN numbers were in error and my six prescriptions would not be covered by Cigna until they were corrected. 

I fully expect that Cigna will soon correct their errors but I do not why they allow the application to post out of date information. Had they posted that information was being updated and a revised medical card would be available in 24 hours I would understand and I would have avoided a public discussion concerning the online insurance card and why it was no longer accepted. 

Cigna‚Äôs errors and omissions are sadly not limited to bad data.  Their supposedly professional staff (Rn‚Äôs not MD‚Äôs) are quite willing to debate medical issues with cardiologists and their staff. Ultimately the doctors rule the day but only after wasting time by the doctor, patient and pharmacist.

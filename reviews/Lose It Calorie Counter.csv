I started using it about 10 years ago and it helped me lose about 40 pounds in the first year. It just made me very conscious of what I ate, in part with just keeping track of it by entering it, and in part, it was helping me understand where all the calories came from. It was actually very easy to lose the weight by knowing what piled on calories, and what I could fill up on without worrying. I got to my goal, and I have kept at that stable weight for the past nine years and I think it’s great. And my eating is much healthier in addition to being at a good weight. The second thing is that the technical support is great. The app was very easy to use, but over the last few months, it became very sluggish and frustrating. I didn’t think to actually reach out to customer support but instead I wrote a review with only two stars instead of 5 that I’d previously rated it, complaining about it. Well, technical support reached out to me and asked for some information, and then they just made a suggestion - that I make sure all my data was backed up online, which it was without doing anything, and then delete and reinstall the app. I did that, and it completely fixed the problem. I don’t think I’ve ever had an app technical service person reach out to me proactively from a review, start a dialogue, and then give me a solution to fix the problem.

Whenever I get to a point where I don’t  like the way I fit into clothes or the way I look in the mirror, I know I can go to LoseIt!, start tracking, and achieve my goals.  Every time I use this app I end up eating less and I’m way more conscious of my food choices, which end up being much healthier. Even my skeptical trainer says the app is good. I paid for the premium this time around so I can track my protein and cholesterol/saturated fat. My only wish is that I could track grams of calcium in food since I have osteoporosis. My only criticism is that sometimes the portions aren’t correct even when scanned(bag of Trader Joe’s beef jerky is not 90 cal, it’s 360cal), and it’s much better to weigh or measure your food and use that number as portion size than the number of something in a serving (13 shrimp weigh more than the serving size in grams - 10 shrimp was the actual number corresponding to the 85 grams for the serving).  It’s important to compare the portion size to the actual size (that corresponds to the calories listed in the serving on package and LoseIt!), and be honest with yourself about portion size if you want this to work. This is true in all weight loss apps. Overall, I love this app and the data provided gives me exactly what i need to keep motivated.

Even though other popular fitness apps like ""YourExerciseBuddy"" get the limelight, Lose It! just works without all of the hype and corporate sponsorships. I actually enjoy using this because it is easy to tracks calories, macros, and meals. The food database is deep and the ability to scan barcodes is wonderfully helpful. Shared meals and recipes from other users help to fill in gaps as well. It also syncs easily with my Apple Watch and Health kit to incorporate workouts and data. 

If I had to choose anything to critique it would be this: (1) When searching for food or restaurants in the database, you have to repeat the search term each and every time you make a selection. This is a pain when adding multiple items from one place like Panera Bread or Jimmy John's. I end up copying and pasting the term but saving the previous search would be most helpful. And (2) having the ability to edit the time and date that one enters their blood sugar would be nice. I often check my sugars throughout the day but can't input my numbers into the app until later and it is creating a false timeline of data.

Okay so as you can see in my old review LoseIt was a really good app that just needed some minor adjustments.. But now? It has since become the new hangout spot for underage kids asking adults how to starve themselves. I used to love interacting in the groups but now it seems like every other post is filled with an underage teen ranting about how they just binged & tried to make themselves throw up. I thought this app was for 18+..? It truly is a drag to be in groups now. These days I just log my food & weight then close the app. This is truly the new hangout spot for underage kids with eating disorders.

My old Review: I’ve lost 38+ pounds since using the Lose It App! I love everything about this app although I do have a few suggestions I’m hoping the developers will take into consideration. 1. Expand the food data base. 2. For the “Recipes” category, you should be able to create folders so you can organize your recipes. (Ex: You can create a folder for breakfast recipes, lunch, dinner, etc) That would really take creating recipes to the next level. 3. Under “My Food”, you should be able to add different foods. I wanted to add Wyman’s Just Fruit to my food catalog but there was no option to. 4. When creating recipes, there should be an option to move your added ingredients into any order you want. Get those changes going and my rating will be a 5 star!",4,False,SundayaMartin04,From Amazing to New ED Hangout?,Lose It Calorie Counter
2019-07-09 10:57:14,,"After my second child my weight just stayed. I was told by my OB that at my sons one year birthday the weight that you have then tends to become your new average. My son was six months old and my weight was not budging, I knew I had to do something but didn’t know how or have the energy to do something complicated. 
I found out about loose it through reading a blog about calorie deficiency. I knew this seemed like the most logical & healthy way to loose weight and start a better lifestyle but the idea of tracking everything was off putting and seemed to hard. This app (I’m using the free version) is amazing! I’m down approx 3lbs in a week and a half and I’m not hungry. I’m not eating in a way that is not sustainable and the tracker makes it so easy to log and to see what is cased my day to be a success or a failure. I might also add that I started the week of vacation over 4th of July & I still saw success even with going over a few days. Because the tracker makes you aware of what you’re eating even when you “cheat” you’re aware of when and by how much. 
If you’re thinking about trying to loose weight & are not sure how to start I would highly recommend trying this app. It holds your hand, steps you through & links you to community for support.

2023-03-14 16:54:17,,I’ve been using this app on and off for years.  I love that I can put in my own recipes.  It’s great at basic calorie tracking and I paid for extra features this year so I can track carbs and other things.  Unfortunately it does not track added sugar.  It only tracks sugar as a whole.  So fine I have to keep track elsewhere by hand.  I can find another tracker next year.  But where my frustration comes is from selecting food.  Let’s say I eat 1/4 cup of granola.  I ate it hours ago and want to quickly add it.  I find my granola but my choices are all grams.  I don’t know off hand and don’t want to try and do a bunch of conversions at work.  So I look for my granola in cups.  I scroll through 10 possibilities and then notice they all have different calorie counts for the same amount and supposedly the same item.  I select my granola finally thinking I should have the right item and calories count but wow those carbs look extra high.  I have to double check the product or find it online.  Things I don’t always have time to do. And then I discover the calories are correct but the carbs are wrong.  So I end up creating my own food.  This has become a constant issue and I double check everything.  This was not an issue when I first started with loose it.  But I have noticed you can upload your item for everyone.  The database is too convoluted and no one appears to be checking what people upload.,3,False,luem,"Was happy, now not so much",Lose It Calorie Counter

I have been using this app since at least 2012 and what I tend to do it pay for the premium and then after it runs out, the next time I have extra cash I pay for another year. But the great thing about this app is that the free version is still completely functional so I was ok going without premium for a few months at a time. Having ads in a free version is totally understandable but there is a huge difference between banner ads and the new, usually unskippable ads that you’ve added in and it completely breaks this app in my mind. It might be tolerable if you had different subscription options aside from just one yearly cost all at one time. For a lot of people it’s easier to have lower monthly fees than one big yearly fee. 

Apps that use ads like what you’ve added are usually an INSTANT delete for me but because I’ve been with this app for SO long and love it so much I really don’t want to delete it. However, having this specific type of ads in also makes me never want to pay for premium again and just find another app to use out of spite. This type of intrusive ad says we really don’t care about providing our customers with a quality product anymore, we’re just going use them to make us more money with every ad that gets accidentally clicked while someone is trying to make it go away.

It stands to reason that the miracle cures don’t  work or people would stop spending money on them (as they were no longer needed) and the industry would slow.  So far - tracking intake is working.  I eat what I want and write it all (and I mean all) down.  Weight isn’t flying off, but the trend is down!

One note so far - even some of the “green check” (verified) calorie counts don’t match the packaging for the product.  I push up the serving size to greater than I actually ate in order to bump up the calories to where I think they really are - so it is not entirely turn key.

I would  have given five stars but paying for a year of the no-ad app was going to be a “reward” at hitting a goal I am still a ways from - the ads were not as horrid until they stopped offering a deep discount.

Loseit! was an app recommended by my pedometer app, and I kind of got it on a whim. 😅 I love to eat, have my Dad's sweet tooth, and am (more than) a bit lazy (ok, just highly unmotivated)... none of that is good for weight loss, so every bit helps, right? 
Well, I got a scale, started counting calories with the app (the free one, not premium), and went walking or biking depending on weather. It is a bit over 100 days later, and I've lost 50lbs/23kg. I'm going to keep going another 20-30lbs/9-14kg, though at a slower rate for the holidays. 😉
Self discipline is really important to how successful you'll be, though. If you don't log everything (I know it is inconvenient/a pain/insert opinion here), but not doing so is pretty much setting yourself up for failure. I'm not saying 'don't eat sugary foods/that one food that's bad for you that is a guilty pleasure', that would be hypocritical of me (again: I love food & have a huge sweet tooth. There is no way I'm ever not going to eat what I want). I'm saying that if weight loss is important to you, you won't cheat yourself by fudging your log. Be brutally honest with yourself.

I am especially pleased with the extensiveness of the food index, the ability to add personal recipes, and the app’s recommendations based on eating history. I also like that you can enter a goal weight and the app calculates the approximate date of achieving that goal, based on your calorie intake and activity levels.

The only thing I don’t like is the constant barrage of “buy our plus features subscription” ads. Every time I open the app, a pop up appears telling me that it’s my “last chance” to get the extra features at 25% off. It’s been my “last chance” for over three months. I understand that I’m using the free version, and developers have to pay rent the same as me. But I get this pop up ad each and every time I open the app. Every. Single. Time. Which means I have taken to keeping a sticky note of my meals so I only need to open the app once a day, or every couple of days. (This is why I only gave it two stars. It’s super annoying.)

I would love it if the developers could please give an option to pay a one-time fee to never see that pop up again. Or at the very least if they could decrease the frequency it appears. Because I would absolutely pay a one time fee for the basic tracking part without the extra features of the subscription. But I have no need of a subscription, and I really don’t need constant reminders of my apparently eternal “last chance” pricing.",2,False,Bammble Bee,"Great app, too many ads",Lose It Calorie Counter

For the first few days, i didnt try to limit myself at all, just ate what i would normally eat in the amounts i would normally have and saw just how much i was eating compared to what it said i should be for my goals (i was eating about an extra 400 cals a day) and then slowly lowered my calories per day to what the app suggested for my goals. It even lets you know if it finds patterns in what you’re eating that are helpful to your goals (it pointed out that on days i eat chicken, i eat fewer calories overall). It’s super user friendly, and you can either look up brands of your foods or use the barcode scanner to find them more quickly.

It provides a weekly running total of my progress in terms of calories, which helps me cheat a bit more on a day where I might be ahead of my weight loss goal for the week.

For example, I want my calories to be 300 cals minus my maintenance which is 2232 cals. So that’s 1932 cals monday-Friday. It would also be beneficial to have re-feed days also known as diet breaks; Saturday-Friday which means I would eat at my maintenance cals which once again is 2232.

The food UPC scan feature is so easy and so many foods are already part of the data base. Many restaurant items are listed, again making recording easy.
I do like the nutritional scoring but only really use it to adjust protein/carb/fat intake. Other nutritional values can be incomplete as most users adding items only add calories. 
Issues: Users are allowed to add there own items which can be incorrect from spelling to calories to nutritional content. This is managed by app developer with (green checks) as verified but the unverified can make the app search a bit messy.

The biggest issue - it constantly, as in every time, freezes up while scrolling down on the “Log” page to get to the meal I want to enter info for. Often it takes exiting the app and opening it again but even then it’ll keep freezing up. It also freezes up after tapping “Done”.  It’s hard to be consistent with tracking when the app is so inconveniently slow. 

Think of it this way, entering one meal would use up 1/3 of a 30 min lunch, or all of a 10 min work break. I usually wait until the end of the day to enter everything because it’s so time consuming to use. I would rather be reading a book or having a conversation with my spouse rather than mentally rolling my eyes and thinking, “Okay, now I have to deal with LoseIt! and then I can finally wind down for the day.”",2,False,Doctor Fan Since I Was Six,"Freezes, Super Slow, But Has So Much Potential…",Lose It Calorie Counter

My disappointment comes when I spend money on the app. I’ve had several days where in the mornings the app has logged my steps, but somehow at the end of the evening, the steps have magically disappeared. 
Another issues I have is with the paid version. With the paid version you’re supposed to be able to see all set goals at the bottom when you log your food. Mine happens to be sugar, carbs, fiber, and water. However, the only goal that shows up  is the one for my steps. So no I must go through more steps to get the same information, which would have been the same steps as if I continued on with the free version. 
Finally, whether or not you spend money, I believe there are apps that can offer better insight than what the lose it app provides. As there have been times when I’ve had to google information, then program it into the app. As more often than not, more than three search results will appear for the same item, but completely different information regarding calorie count, sugar, fiber and so on.

This app is super simple and I found myself fully accountable to...myself!! I actually enjoyed logging or scanning my foods and challenging myself to make my goals.

I am watching my carbs and like to plan a couple days ahead. It’s a little challenging if LoseIt only totals carbs when the food is not in planned mode.

I have done the free version for 3-4 years and the premium version for 2 years total (at separate times). 

First, the ads trying to get you to sign up for premium are insane now. Like 2-4 times per 5 minute session I’m in the app. It was not like this 5 years ago. Second, the food databank is so full of junk entries, finding the food I need with the correct stats takes forever. Usually I give up and create my own complete and correct entry which also takes forever. And lastly, where is the pregnancy setting?!!! I have gone through 2 complete pregnancies now and have requested this feature multiple times. We all know the majority of your users are women, and guess what, they have babies! Lots of them! Even the most basic setting to not be shamed for gaining weight. 

Ugh, the only reason stick around at this point is to make recipes for my husband. He’s not ready to give up years of his data. I’m so over it, I don’t even use anymore for myself.",2,True,Steph….,Needs pregnancy setting,Lose It Calorie Counter

During the set up process, it asks for your birthday, to help calculate your “calorie budget”. When I entered mine, it told me I must 18 years old to join…now I think that is ridiculous! Why isn’t a 16 year old allowed to lose weight too? I’m trying to start my weight loss journey early so it doesn’t become harder as I’m older, but the app thinks otherwise. Yes, I can just lie about my age, which I WILL, by putting the lowest I can. It still bothers me though your age is put into a formula and even just a one year difference can change the output a whole lot. So saying I’m 2 years older than I actually am might mess me up a whole lot.
I’d love if they would AT LEAST put the age minimum to 13 years old, because teenagers deserve a fair chance at fitness and personal health, just as much as adults.

I subsequently found quite a few posts on the forum that mentioned the same thing!  I really think they should have a gradual increase up to TDEE with the user having input.

This is also about the equivalent of losing three watermelons of weight (the app will give you mini milestone analogies like that as you progress which are great for morale!) — hooray!

My phase one goal is to hit 150, and phase two is hitting 135. I'm a 5'8"" woman who, for the better part of her life, always weighed in the 120s. I'm trying to be a friend to myself and focus on the 130s this time around.

What really surprised me is that a lot of people in my ADHD support groups have been using this app for a long time. My group has found that the initial thrill of entering our calories “gamifies” food choices long enough to form the habit of calorie journaling. Forming habits is really hard with ADHD so it’s good to make it feel like a game: how can we “spend” points to get maximum satiety out of what we eat.

The app points out positive habits - never negative ones - like hey, when you eat cheese, you consume fewer overall calories. The positive habits tell you which foods keep your energy up, and some with ADHD struggle with self-loathing so here we aren’t focused on what we do “wrong.” Foods aren’t demonized either.

The graphs and charts for weight loss help me stay on track despite fluctuations in weight. If I get upset over water weight or have a special occasion that causes me to exceed my calories and gain a little, I can see the bigger picture. Over time I can see the pattern of weight fluctuation: if I gain one pound, but I’m two pounds lighter overall for the month, it’s not a big deal.

Its straightforward to find a variety of foods, it lets you create your own foods (although not as intuitively as i would like), and for many items has a variety of portion measurements, but not for all.  It does classify food into macronutrients ,e.g. carbs, fat, and protein which i find useful.  It would be really nice if they also kept track or made it an option to track net carbs.  I tired to make this suggestion to them and sent an email in but never heard back.  Like many creators of these small apps support is not really good.  My definition of good is replying to emails that paying customers send in.  

It does allow you to track a variety of exercises also although it makes a “guess” at calories it would be nice if they allowed users who know how many calories they burned to enter that.  It does allow for connecting to tracking devices like fitbit but not for old time devices like polar heart rate watches.  Oh well.

- Have different text size options, allow us to squeeze more info into 1 glance, if we so choose.
- Allow us to *completely* delete old stuff. Some of us mess up, for a really long time, and when we start a new plan, there's nothing quite like a Blank Slate.
- Greater functionality with Apple Watch (if possible). Ex. Being able to enter data from the watch.
- find a more motivational way to show the graph of weight loss. If you have a lot to lose, even if you're losing weight each week, the progress looks kind of *womp* (little tiny difference) on the graph

  I’ve happily used the app daily for almost two years because it’s the best I’ve found at any price. 

The rewards are more energy, natural hunger and fullness signals, weight loss, and blood tests showing high and low health alert numbers have returned to the normal range. 

I still eat favorite foods and treats—just not compulsively or in huge portions. Lose it is programmed to encourage more activity and to vary daily calories. 

The dreaded food tracking is easy with this app. Once you’ve entered any items or meals the first time, you can just copy the information, changing the quantity or adding foods. 

The recipe feature allows easy tracking of homemade food to reward batch cooking.  

And the database of individual, store bought, and restaurant favorites is huge. It’s also easy to scan codes on store bought foods to track eating.

At this point in time, there is no way to have this be defaulted to on for every new exercise.” That is the only think I find irksome.

2. Some items don’t give you the option to enter anything other than grams, ounce pound or kg. For instance I have my vegan mayonnaise scanned, but all it lets me enter is a grams.

I will never recommend your app again. I have a 70 pound weight loss and brag about your app in all of my fb weight loss groups. No more. I feel cheated and robbed, because I was cheated and robbed.

There are times when scanning a barcode will bring up the correct item, but the details will be off. Maybe it’s outdated/old?  There should be a way for us to update the item as opposed to entering an entirely different entry. 

Lastly,  when you’re trying to lose weight, being precise matters. So when someone enters “1 Serving” as opposed to “28 Grams”, it’s not only unhelpful, it’s frustrating. This is another instance where we should be able to update/change the entry to our needs (ie grams, ounces, servings, etc)

Was!

I opened the app. After 30 minutes looking around after my initial personal data entry, I could not figure out what was what. Where do I enter a simple food like a slice of bread?  A couple of eggs.

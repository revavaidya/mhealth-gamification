It‚Äôs as if they have beautifully sculpted the app with time. I really appreciate the choices given when I open Calm. Sometimes I need a moving meditation. Sometimes I need the wisdom Sometimes a little humor and sometimes only Tamara‚Äôs calming voice will do. I really appreciate the meditating sounds of soft rain or a washing machine or waves ebbing & flowing. But my very tough Working K9 will only calm when going through his annual vet visit with blood tests and shots and such to Baby Shhh and it works every time. So I guess if Calms me and my dog, I have to give it five stars. I love the breathing part. I use it almost daily. Not a fan of the music but the sleep stories are the best and I love that I can use the search bar and find one of my favorites I may be in the mood for such as a dream over Paris or the history of the Library at Oxford or the train stories. Also the narrators offer excellent choices and their are certain ones whom I just need to hear at hard times because their soft melodic gift of storytelling puts me right out. I really appreciate the variety.

I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years.

For the first time in my life, I was confident it wasn‚Äôt a panic attack and actually a heart attack. I stumbled out my apartment door, sweat dripping down my face and the few clothes covering my body. I dropped my phone on the way down the stairs but happened to call 911 right beforehand.

I have had your app since my middle school years. I‚Äôve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn‚Äôt a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ‚Äùok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER.

I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible.

One area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman.

It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations.

A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners.

They are either too loud (even on the lowest setting) or reading with too much inflection which excites one rather than lulling one to sleep.

2021-08-16 15:11:56,,"Two major concerns. First of all, I judge how sincere an app like this is about helping people by the availability of free content. I understand that it takes resources to produce content of this quality, but this app verges on hostile towards the non-paying user, and some people just can‚Äôt afford to pay. I saw someone saying that the master classes were available, so I looked into that - um, no. It‚Äôs the *trailers* that are available, and this sort of bait-and-switch is typical of the non-paying experience in this app.

Second, I have chronic pain, and there isn‚Äôt any content that comes up when I search for that - there apparently isn‚Äôt anything health-related at all. The one free guided meditation I found started triggering panic as it made me more aware of my pain, and I had to stop. 

The upshot is that this app seems targeted towards a ‚Äúbeautiful person‚Äù demographic whose problems really will all go away if they start meditating. The series by Lama Rod Owens seems like a step in the right direction, but it‚Äôs going to take a complete reevaluation of the goals and design to really address the problem.

However the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person, Tamara Levitt. She also guides many of the meditation series they have available. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt enjoy how Tamara does her meditations and I find them more distracting than helpful.

The music is calming, the guidance is very calming and helpful. And it's very easy to use and I love the reminder and quotes at the end. Again, I can't rate this app highly enough.

I use the daily calm almost every day. the lessons in the meditation so often are reinforcing what I‚Äôm learning and hearing in another part of my life.

I recently listened to the Breaking Bad Habits addiction class and really felt as though I was at a seminar for psychologists and neuroscientists.  It was amazing what I learned.  I have a daughter who is a neuroscience and psych major in college. I had to share it with her.

The first one that I made some time ago was that I found it extremely difficult in the middle of the night to see the icons or read anything without glasses. I asked if they could make them little bit larger for  those of us who cannot see well at night without reading glasses. They never responded, in fact with in a few weeks they made the reading icons even more difficult to read.

Being a neuroscientist I recommended this app to my patients. Many of them complained of this difficulty and so I once again wrote a support ticket. They Never responded.
They also changed the voice of the Female narrator for the meditations and put a background noise which is constant. This may be easy for some people to hear her voice without difficulty But I find it impossible. Background sound rushing water perhaps like Niagara Falls. Very difficult to concentrate and hear her voice clearly.  I am a 20+ year veteran meditator and find this new sound agitating 
I explained it was difficult and asked if they would turn the volume down. The Never responded and made no change.

There is something for every part of the day. Most segments are a bit over ten minutes but there are longer as well.  There are too many options to list! And even just the sounds (waves to lakes to cat purring) are great to have in the background, especially if like me, you get a little overstimulated and benefit from gentle white noise as a reminder to slow down.

I am so in love with this app!!! Best $60 I‚Äôve spent in ages, although I originally thought it was billed $5/month. At least it prompts me to get as much as I can out of it.

However, I‚Äôd like to report a major bug that is making the experience quite stressful. In the master classes, when I open the app after having navigated away from it to do something else, it starts playing audio automatically, and not only one track, but often two or three different audio files play at once. There is no pause button, so my phone is just shouting multiple audio tracks at once and I have to push play on something, anything, to add another audio track to the cacophony before I can then push pause, which somehow stops all tracks from playing and finally silences the app.

This also happens when going from one segment of a master class to the next. If you let it autoplay the next segment, it works fine. But if you click the play button to play the next segment, it immediately starts playing back the next segment twice (two audio files playing back at the same time but about 5 seconds apart).

Add a button to eliminate sleep stories we don‚Äôt want so as not to have to scroll through rows and rows of stories I don‚Äôt understand or like.  Often I fall asleep before a story is over and before I can add a heart, forgetting the next day to do it then.

Add a function to allow for continuous play of the masterclass sessions or meditation session.  Also add a shuffle feature for the stories.  It‚Äôs a hassle to constantly fumble with the device every few minutes to proceed through sessions.  Personally, I like to use the classes and meditations as sleep stories too.

TLDR: App is poorly designed; make sure you like Tamara Levits way of speaking before subscribing bc she‚Äôs 90% of the guided meditations:

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they're looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. 

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt.

I haven't been as nervous & tensed after listening to the daily sessions which is good cause before there wasn't anything I could do to help me relax. I was as tight as a rubber band.

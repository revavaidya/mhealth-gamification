The database for foods is great and I up until recently just used the free version.  During this time I lost 11 lbs.  I set my profile to the lowest setting for activity and have my pedometer set to the app to add calories I get for walking.  My goal is to just keep under the calories based on losing 1.5 LBS a week.  My suggestion is record everything even if you go over (it will happen occasionally).  But that’s ok because you can work harder the next day.  
I finally did buy the premium version mainly for the export feature.  I am an analyst by trade so I like to put my results into graphs and do monitoring beyond the app’s capabilities.   I will stress it is not needed to lose weight.  If you don’t want to spend time looking at your different nutrients then I would not spend the money on it.  If you do it could be worth it.
I like how the app says you have a 67% chance of better success if you pay for the premium.  They don’t tell you about the confounder.  The reason that happens most likely is people who do buy the app in general are more serious about the long hall.  This should not be viewed as a diet it needs to be viewed as a life change that you will do going forward.

It links to Garmin Connect for integrating exercise calories into the overall balance for the day. You can scan barcodes for food  items for easier logging. You can select items from your history of previous entries (great for frequently eaten foods). You can text search for foods, which accesses an enormous list of prior entries that I assume have been entered or scanned by other users. So why only four stars? My only peeve with the program is that it doesn’t seem to let users edit the serving size for many items, beyond being able to select from a too often extremely limited and sometimes arbitrary mix of imperial/metric/liquid/solid measures. The options presented vary widely from item to item, with little apparent logic. The best solution I have is to try to find items that use 1g as a serving size and then list the number of grams for that day’s serving as the number of servings for that entry. Since I’m using a food scale, that works for me. Seems a better solution would be to allow users to edit any food item to select from a full complement of serving sizes (or to just directly enter the desired serving size using the keyboard). Or just provide 1g as a choice in all cases (or at least all solid cases). In any case, I love and recommend the app, with the measurement detail being my only pet peeve.",4,False,Great app but could use more user control of selecting or defining serving sizes,georg-o,MyFitness Pal Calorie Counter

Why would you have these kinds of ads show up on the home page of a food log app? 

Also, if you sync with Fitbit it enters your workouts automatically but it also tracks your steps and gives you a calorie adjustment for that as well, which Is like double tracking. If you go for a run for example, it will sync the workout from fitbit and give you the calories for that, and then also add in your steps from the run and give you more calories which I don’t think is accurate. 

Other than that, no other food app compares as far as the extensive food database and the ease of being able to enter recipes, meals, etc. I also love the social functionality where friends can comment on your status.

Over the past year plus, unfortunately, the company continues to make terrible decisions.

Now, after years of using this app, I and many others are moving on.  There are better apps out there that make it easy to log calories in and out.  There are still apps out there that let all users log food by scanning barcodes.  There are apps out there that offer more premium options for a much better price.  Like many companies out there.

MyFitnessPal was clunky from the moment it requested my vitals (difficult to scroll and go to the next input field), to the tutorial, to the constant pop ups demanding I consider upgrading to premium. I’ve barely used the app yet, why not leave me alone and try again when I’ve actually had time to experience it? There is no focus on calorie information on the home page, instead dedicating screen space to blog posts etc. that I don’t have the time or desire to read anyway.

However, it makes the app very buggy. I find that whenever I open the app to pre-plan my meals for the day, I am being forced to end my fast.

It worked so well & I loved it, personally I dint even mind all the different ad bombardments after logging food in. But sadly they decided to put a feature, the barcode scanner which I use regularly behind the premium pay wall. The barcode scanner made my food log ins easier & faster, it's literally a key reason as to why I became more consistent regarding tracking my food. I’m not even going to consider buying premium because it is extremely overpriced. Putting previously free features behind a paywall will not make me wanna buy into an overpriced premium. I guess onto another app that actually offers decent features for its free users. 
My problem with premium it’s overpriced. I realize premium offers a bunch of different features like a handy barcode scanner now & a lot of different tracking mechanics which is great if you want that. When my goal is literally track my calories & protein (that’s it, I’m not interested in anything else) why would I pay $80 a year or even $20 a month (that’s basically a gym membership by the way) 
Solution: Creat another cheaper more affordable tier to premium that allows you to do all the basic stuff free users do without ads & a barcode scanner.

My weight was 296lbs and my kidney function was dropping. My particular kidney condition is an autoimmune disease, so there are some medications that help, but there’s very little that can be done to directly control it. He highly recommended that I lose weight because that would ease the burden on my kidneys at least and it would help potentially extend their function. Over two years later, I religiously use MyFitnessPal to track ALL my food, down to the last crumb and ounce. About 5 months ago, my weight loss had plateaued, so I started watching my net carbs in addition to my calories. I have my maximum net carbs set to 60 rather than a keto diet level due to my other health issues and I started losing weight again. I am thrilled to say that thanks to MyFitnessPal and a lot of determination on my part and help from my family, I’ve lost 109lbs and increased my kidney function by about 10%!

After scanning the barcode and pulling up the item, I see that I am unable to enter portion by gram. This is odd as the food label lists grams in a serving, so I check other Metamucil items in the database to see if that option is present. It is not. So I enter the tsp equivalent. Apparently “2 tsp(s)” is 30 calories, while “2 tsp” is 40... ok well 30 is the correct amount, however the app then shows incorrect carbs and fiber. To enter a generic banana by weight, I had to set serving size to 1 g and then enter 137.4 servings. As a developer that has also done a fair amount of quality assurance testing, if a simple method for entering portion by weight is available in this app, then I can confidently say the user interface in anything but intuitive. If the feature doesn’t exist, then it is hard to take this app seriously. A food scale allows an app like this to be much more accurate. I will stick to the app I’m already using, where I enter almost every item by weight, and the results match the label. Metamucil is not an obscure item.

I don’t use any of MFP’s features except for the calorie tracking ones. I do use the “recipe” feature a lot as it lets me portion out big batches appropriately.

My one complaint is that I’ve had the recipe app crash MULTIPLE times while I’m in the middle of cooking. Obviously this is a pain because I can’t just remember the itemized list of ingredients in painstakingly measured grams.

It says there’s a card for it on the dashboard, but there’s nothing but 4 cards (3 of which are “premium”). I can’t see my old weight logs either. I can log my food, but a weight loss app is kind of pointless if you can’t keep track of your weight.

I’ve also had issues with it converting my steps into exercise. This has been going on for a couple months. It has no problem being accurate with my steps (just from my iPhone), but it rarely updates the exercise calories to reflect the steps. I know there are millions of options it has to find as far as food entries, but there are times where I scan and item’s barcode and the nutrition information that pops up does not match the nutritional information on the actual item (even if it finds the correct/exact item in the database). Because of this, I do not plan to purchase the premium package. Im worried that I’ll pay for something that I’ll still have to double check and do the math myself.

The app will read and write the *same* data from Apple Health, screwing up your weight in both apps. I always update my weight in Apple health but when you look at the data in the app it shows the source of the data and after every entry in Apple, there is an  identical entry written by MFP. Sometimes this is a day after another entry and this especially screws up my data. Doesn’t seem there is an easy way to fix and has increasingly become a frustrating problem. 
The good features are the ability to see your data at a glance under the progress tab that is easy to get to and shows progress in weight, steps, and other body measurements. 
I have tried a few other apps that have a much nicer UI (like Senza) but while it looks great, the design is a bit more complicated to use. KetoDiet has much more relevant, diet-inclusive recipes than MFP but it probably would not be as useful to someone on a different diet.

I've been a MyFitnessPal member for years and do appreciate the detail, massive database, and ability to input your own recipes you get for free.

This is useless when you have to do it 4 times a day or more at different times, and you can't look back at sugar levels as part of your diary (linked to your diet). Do the manufacturers just assume that people interested in fitness and diabetics are mutually exclusive populations?

Also, this is more nit picky but on the nutrients page it said I got 61g of protein and 62g of fat.

Firstly, the UI has changed dramatically and is just a pain to navigate without running into bugs. The search no longer seems to provide accurate information for a lot of well-known foods. Secondly, the premium. Before, you could still get some good use out of this app without paying for the premium service. I paid it four years ago and I found it well worth it, at THAT time. Now however, you can hardly to anything except track calories and the big three macronutrients without spitting out $20 MONTHLY, to use even their barcode scan feature (which used to be free). You also have the option to do a yearly subscription for $80, which isn’t awful, but I’d much prefer a one-time payment instead of having to pay $20 monthly to use features that once were free.

Maybe there is a way to do that and I just haven’t found it yet. Finally being able to enter the type of diet you eat would be great and then if you are low or high on calories, protein etc it would make suggestions on specific foods to eat to make up for any high or low.  It does tell you if you have surpassed the “limit” but having suggestions would be amazing.

The only good thing about this app, and the only thing that prevented anyone from moving to a different one, has been the vast user generated database. Being able to find pretty much anything, and if not, easily scan an item, made this the best calorie counter app in spite of its flaws. Now you are attempting to destroy even that by removing the barcode scanner. Not only can an individual not scan in something, but worse still, there will be far fewer things scanned for users to find already there. This will be the thing that eventually kills this app. Not today, probably not tomorrow. But after a while it will just stop being the vast database it was as new food items come out, and no one who paid for premium has scanned them. By then, some other app will have the best database, and that’s when everyone will go there and this app will be a forgotten afterthought.

There have been ads, and that’s fine. Swipe and move on. There have been some minor hiccups along the way. Again, all fine.

In recent weeks, though, the app’s gone to full page ads that pop up when they shouldn’t. Such as, after logging one item that I ate for lunch, and I click on what should be a “back” button turns into an ad. (And, perhaps, unethically, a click that gets MFP/UA more from the advertiser…or at least additional click numbers.)

2.  The price is way too high for what it is. Maybe add a less premium option for people who just want a couple of the premium features without paying $80 a year.

3. A more interesting home page.

With this update, entering my weight is impossibly difficult. The app glitches and often freezes when I first open it, making scrolling impossible.

Even when it starts to scroll, the app usually gets stuck mid-way down. When I finally get to the weight section, my typical scrolling motion makes the app scroll “right” and instead brings up the step tracker. So, I have to scroll “left” again to get back to the weight tracker. 

MFP has buttons along the bottom for users to enter their calorie intake, enter their activities, and follow a Facebook-like newsfeed - but nothing for their weight.

Some improvements:
improvement, sharing of recipes with friends would be nice.  Putting a caloric value to weight training would be nice as well.  A big issue is it won't sync with the movescount app by Suunto.  The other issue is serving information would be as weight for everything, making some in cup, & some in weight is frustrating.

New update for May 2016:  
I don't know what happened but now it won't save items after I add them & close the app, & I can't enter more than one food item at a time without it depopulating.  Fix fast or it move on to an app that works & never come back.

2019 update:

Another thing that has gone awry with UA owning my fitness pal is there exorbitant monthly fee to use the premium version of the app. $20 a month is a gym membership or groceries. And what you get in the premium selection isn’t worth $20 a month. $1.99 I might consider it, but not with the app in its current state. It is so full of bugs now, and difficult to access basic functions, like weight, tracking, which, incidentally is buried. That it makes even $1.99 untenable.

I recommend trying out this app. One concern though: for someone trying to gain or maintain weight the feedback system is wrong (it is not a good thing when weight goes down). The feedback in the app should be appropriate for the goal. Wish list: many people who use this would really benefit from another screen tracking medications. I would even be willing to pay for that as an additional feature. Another feature I'd pay for is tracking of vital stats like blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, temperature, and so on.

One huge and increasing frustration is the database has become polluted somehow with incorrect dietary figures.

Unfortunately the data has gotten polluted with those happy to accept misinformation. 
 
I understand the green checks result from verified input but also when others use that information. Maybe you ought to consider letting users flag those that need better review. I have found myself looking for more accurate information and then using other than verified inputs to get closer to true values. 

One other suggestion might be to allow users to share recipes.

Unfortunately, the scanner is now locked behind the paywall. Like I said, I have no need for the nutritional plans, so $20/mo or $80/yr is a crazy amount to pay for just the scanner.

I’d like to request a second tier that is far less expensive giving us access to the scanner, macro tracking, and even no ads. Let the higher price be for those interested in the meal and nutritional plans. I’d be happy to pay for that, something like $5/mo, $25/yr?

Rather than just removing existing features from the free version of the app, you should think of new, better, valuable features to ADD to the premium version of app which will incentivize people into getting a subscription.

“We never like to disappoint our members. While it was a difficult decision, this change allows us to continue to improve our product offerings, focus resources, and deliver excellent service to our community.”

This is a direct quote from the email about it, and I immediately deleted MFP entirely after reading it.

Many features that we basic, free components are now going to cost $80/ year to use, and if you want to use the bare bone features that are left in the free version, you have to put up with full page ads that slow you and the app overall.

I lost 60 lbs starting when I was in college by using MFP diligently. I could not afford to pay for premium, and it was (quite literally) a life saver. It changed my life and I live healthy and happy, where before I was on the fast track to heart disease and stroke. Now I’d have to pay more than $50 a year to continue to live better.

People all across the US and the world can’t afford to pay to not have ads, so they’ll gladly watch ads. But removing base functionality in exchange for profit is simply greedy and insulting to the dedicated users who have stood with MFP for years.

By charging to help people attain a healthy lifestyle, MFP is contributing to the discrimination against people with suboptimal health. MFP is no longer promoting health and wellness for everyone. Just health and wellness for those who line their pockets.

Now you also need premium to simply scan a  barcode and log food items or you have to search and enter them manually which you didn’t have to do the last time I was on the app. It is now virtually useless to me and has been deleted.

I’d try to log something and then exit to the main page and a full page ad would pop up and make it almost impossible to click out without opening the ad in safari. I was doing forced shutdowns of the app just to get back to the main page. 

Then of course - the final nail in the coffin. The best feature of the app, its free barcode scanner, has now been moved behind the paywall. And they want to charge you $20/month for the privilege.

For most people serious about maintaining a specific caloric intake, any daily targets already take into account exercise expenditure, i.e. you don’t want to add these expenditures as a “bonus” beyond the daily target. However, if you have any apps with workout tracking connected to this one (or accidentally allow it to track your steps), you CANNOT turn off adding estimated caloric expenditure beyond your daily target without a pro account. 

Sure it’s just more math to figure in, but it kind of defeats the point of having a hard caloric target to strive for. And it’s a major point of friction added to what used to be a smooth experience.

The serving size options are very random and many items don’t have gram options. Even when there is the gram option, it can be a very random number, like 85..and then I have to figure out what fraction of 85 is the amount that I need to input. I always use a kitchen scale, and use different amounts so this ends up taking too much time. Luckily I found a similar app called CalorieKing...you can just input the grams and it calculates it for you, so inputting serving size is super easy.

The other deal-breaker is that there are so many items that have incorrect nutritional info, and multiple entries for the same exact item..each with different nutritional info. It’s easy to just scan a barcode and not double check, but when I did, I realised many items were incorrect. CalorieKing has a very minimal item list, but I end up having to create items in mfp anyway since they’re wrong so often, so it doesn’t make much of a difference. 
Also, CalorieKing has a much nicer layout and doesn’t have all the social stuff which I really don’t care for on mfp.

If I enter data in MFP, instead of transfer incrementally to Fitbit - or MyNetDiary, which I utilize for other reasons (it’s a better choice for this diabetic), it instead aggregates the data adding it to the already existing data, effectively doubling, tripling or more.

2) Custom meal tabs (I added the meal tabs Morning snack, Afternoon  snack and PM snacks to better see my eating habits)
3) Multiple item add is another new favorite! Maybe it was in the basic version and I never noticed it, though...

I liked that it would sync with my phone to track steps, and remembered my meals and previous foods.

Unfortunately, they’ve updated the app with a new layout, and it’s awful. 

Previously, this worked really well for adding things quickly on the fly; there was a bottom nav add button where you could quickly add a meal, food, weight, exercise, etc. 

There’s no longer a general add button. The new dashboard layout is awful; if you don’t have premium, it’s broken up by ads, making the progress charts (which are now tiny) hard to find. And, because they’ve removed the global add button, you do have to find everything individually (food, weight, exercise) to add to that section.

Everything now seems to require more clicks to find and use. Furthermore, the push to upgrade to premium is even worse than before - lots of inconveniently placed ads and locked sections. Given how bad this has become, however, I can’t imagine throwing away money on it.

Positives:
Lots of bells and whistles that you can track and enjoy under the FREE option. 
Scan labels for instance adding foods
Scan urls and recipes. Huge time saver.
Keeps track of data in several ways including graphs to break down meals, nutrients, and vitamins, etc. 

The only drawback for me…

It’s limited on how to identify how much of something you ate. What I mean is that I can’t just grab a specific measurement sometimes. Sometimes the preset measurement sizes are limited too. So…I have to spend a little time converting my portion size in a way that works or just use the presets. I am stuck with trying to adjust the number of servings to correspond to the number of grams I just ate.  (97 grams…only option is 1 gram…so I had 97 servings.) Which is a bit crazy subliminally IMO.

The final straw for me was when I got a banner ad that was simply a rapidly flashing app icon for the Phone app. There wasn’t even a product being advertised, just flashing and extremely obnoxious nonsense persistent on the screen. And the kicker - MFP wants $20 a month basically just to remove ads.

•Maybe it’s my phone, it the app seems exceptionally poorly optimized. When I type something or click something, there’s never NOT a three to ten second input lag. Makes it a pain to type my meals.
•The app should add a daily water goal just like a daily goal for everything else. A lot more useful than getting thrown what I’ve drank in raw ounces with no goal to compare it to. And there’s literally a rule of thumb mathematical formula for it so it shouldn’t be hard to incorporate.

1) The way carbs are calculated with eaten - burned = amount from max makes it seem as though you can exercise off a bad diet. This is absolutely NOT the case. A good diet will help you lose weight, but eating garbage food and exercise won’t do a thing apart from wear you out.

2) When you do strength training, it shows that no calories are burned. I realize weight lifting is considering an “anaerobic” exercise, but it still burns calories. The idea that strength training doesn’t burn calories and only helps with muscle mass is outdated. By the way, aerobic exercise also helps build muscle.

I like being discrete when logging food. I don’t really want other people to know and sometimes do it at work.

Second, the app does not have the option to calculate for net carbs. Most low carb diet plans take net carbs into account rather than total carbs. The workaround for this is to input all of your food values, inserting only net carbs, and not use the foods list available, which is part of the premium service.

There have been no noticeable improvement to this apps barcode reader and the search engine is incredibly inaccurate and unreliable.

If your goal is 1500 which would equal a loss of one pound per week and is 500 calories per day LESS than you need to simply maintain. Theoretically, anything less than 2000 calories will result in weight loss. 
However, if the goal is 1500 /day and you eat 1550, it will predict a weight GAIN. Even though you are still 450 calories UNDER what you need to maintain.

I usually have to tap multiple times. Maybe something in the app is blocking input from the use at certain intervals? Not sure.

Now they just want to charge as much money as possible to use services that were free. 

Logging is very difficult and inaccurate without the barcode scanner. You have to put in extra work to make sure everything is right. 
$20/month for the scanner is just not worth it.

I was okay with the regular adds for fitness gear and articles and stuff. But now, it feels like everywhere you look, you see an add for the stupid and pointless premium version. 
I really only use this app for a few weeks at a time anyway-just to get me going. Then I’ll stop once I have a rhythm going. 

When I fall out of practice, I start counting again (or just meal prep).  This is why I never wanted to pay for it. I don’t use this app 365 days a year. Also my job in the military doesn’t allow me to have my phone on me, so I can’t always log when I eat.

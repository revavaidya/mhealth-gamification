This works pretty well but has some areas for improvement. They put out app updates way too often (once recently three days in a row), which is inconvenient for me as a user and makes me think they issue glitchy updates or their development efforts aren‚Äôt very well coordinated. Mileage accuracy is highly questionable ‚Äî I often ride with my partner who has the same phone and carrier as I do, yet our mileage can be as much as 10% different. From a usability perspective, a couple of the tabs could be combined for more efficient navigation; I suspect they don‚Äôt do much usability/layout research. On the plus side, I love the feature that figures out who else I was riding with (but I don‚Äôt love that it combines my ride maps with theirs when the rides didn‚Äôt exactly match).

The ability to ‚Äúadd media‚Äù (share photos & videos) is great and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised it‚Äôs available on the free version since those media must hog a lot of server memory.

2020-07-27 19:06:35,"Okay so this is a bit of a rage review. I've been using strava pretty dilligently for about 2 years. It's been mostly great, showing timed splits and elevation gain to give a good granular sense of what happened during a workout. It's really all I wanted, since I don't intend on getting heart rate monitor.

However, lately strava has been goofing up on time elapsed, distance gone, maybe my actual location? Not sure. But it'll take a good half-mile for the app to figure out that I've started moving, even after manually starting a workout and confirming that my location is correct. It will also just stop registering that I'm still moving in the middle of a workout, paradoxically showing my location way off of the blue line while the timer is still running. This throws off all the calculations for timing and honestly is pretty disheartening that I don't have an accurate record of my efforts.

I know strava gets is revenue from user data, but why am I using this broken app if it isn't even giving me the data it has advertised? How reliable is the background data being collected? At this point, I might as well go back to using the timer and maps apps built in to iOS, since I'm already using them to figure out what strava did wrong in the first place.",3,False,Hair_david,"Functionality is going downhill, not that strava can measure it",Strava

2) the header part of the app where you have links or buttons. They're hard to press and a lot of the times, the don't work. A good example is the bell on the Feed. You have to press it numerous times or just let your thumb sit there for a few seconds to get you to a notification screen.

It was also very hard to figure out how to get it to display detailed heart rate data.  Even my husband who uses Strava a lot and is a software engineer involved in UI design couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  

It‚Äôs a solid app, but it could use some better UI and improvements with certain sports.  Seems heavily rotated towards biking & running with not enough attention on swimming.   Wish they would purchase or parter with a better swim app like MySwimPro to get better swim data.  

Extra extra cool would be better integration of tides, swells, currents, and weather data for open swimmers.  In 2022, 12 people died near me open swimming and I wonder if apps like this could help people make more informed decision when making choices.  Strava could also advertise safety gear like a $20 swim buoy to open water swimmers.   Perhaps even with Strava logo on it‚Ä¶it could save lives.

Also wish it were easier to connect with other people doing my sports in the area.   Surprised the social aspect is so focused on existing friends.   Seems like a nice way to connect with others.

Old 1* review;
For the last 5 months or so, with a few days here and there of working properly, Strava or iPhone has been unable to properly keep track of my distance. It just goes crazy & puts random lines all over the place. It was a 5 Star app, but lately its just been a disappointment. Made walking not so much fun. Fix it & you‚Äôll get your 5 Star back.

Customers have asked for options such as the ability to filter out unwanted activities (like swimming or yoga, no one cares), but strava has not responded.  There are more and more ads of course.  I‚Äôve read a lot of strava‚Äôs forums, maybe strava should as well.

As a free mileage and route tracker, strava performs as well as any other cycling app with the added semi-benefit of a social media style feed which no one really interacts with in a serious way. 

Upgrading to premium offers several benefits, none of which are actually that enticing. The main feature is being able to map your heart rate and caloric burn rate against other variables for each ride. 

What made me cancel my subscription is how poor the HR tracking actually is. There are huge flat spots and unexplained cliffs (example: going up a hill and strava says my HR is around 100bpm) on my charts consistently.

2019-11-02 22:50:04,"This app really encouraged me all summer long in getting back into running shape. The stats, like average pace, heart rate, calories burned, etc. are huge in keeping me going back out, run after run. I just finished a run & could not find my average heart rate. Thought I was going crazy, but after reading the recent reviews, my fears have been confirmed - I can‚Äôt believe you removed the heart rate feature! You will be losing a lot of followers because of this, including me. ‚úåüèº",1,False,ntombe24,No more heart rate monitoring?! Wow.,Strava
2019-09-26 13:36:15,"Overall I‚Äôve been quite pleased with Strava. I‚Äôve been a user for the better part of ten years. I recently bought a Wahoo TICKR heart rate monitor strap, as I‚Äôd like to start training with heart rate zones. Unfortunately the newest version of the Strava app on my iPhone no longer supports external heart rate sensors. I contacted customer service, and they confirmed this. Come on Strava, this is very disappointing from the leader of fitness and activity tracking!",2,False,Capt. Cobb,No external heart rate data,Strava
2019-09-23 16:10:32,"What happened to the Apple Watch synchronization? Now once a day when I first try using Strava to track my run or cycling, it doesn‚Äôt work and tells me to sign up or sign in. So I mess around with the app settings on my phone, and I eventually get it to work but not sure how. And whatever I do to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt stop this from happening again the next day.

2019-09-04 00:55:16,"The compatibility of the strava app and the Apple Watch are not the best. I have to either use my watch to track my run and receive insight into my heart rate and sacrifice some of my performance stats, or use the phone and sacrifice the heart rate analytics.

2019-06-24 10:04:37,"I‚Äôve been using Map My Run for several years but heard wonderful things about Strava from running friends so I decided to give it a try. Not sure what the big deal is... all this app does is track your activity and share with friends. It is NOT connected to your music (you need to open your music app for that) and it does NOT announce mileage and time during your activity, something I need to hear during a race. No thanks, I‚Äôm deleting this app and returning to Map My Run!",1,False,Floydieroo,What‚Äôs So Great?!,Strava

Yes, on Strava but not the other apps. He then proceeds to tell me to contact the other apps. He wants me to contact multiple other apps rather than the app (Strava) which is the source of the problem!",1,False,Dave's ITunes Acct.,That Idiot,Strava

2018-09-06 23:39:01,"Sadly I‚Äôve decided to leave Strava.  The idea is great and the gamification of segments and tracking is an awesome feature but since the beginning of the year the GPS signal just drops and all your data for a run isn‚Äôt recorded (making the gamification pretty useless).

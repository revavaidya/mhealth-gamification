This has always been happening since I moved into this house. After purchasing this app, I quickly became shocked as to what it was capturing at night for the audio. I would hear other peoples voices talking to me keeping me somewhat awake at night. I was never conscious enough to realize this was going on. At first I thought the app was just adding fake audio to make it seem like a special feature so I ended up setting up a camera to record myself sleep in addition to the recording audio from the app. Not only was the app extremely accurate, my camera captured paranormal activity occurring with the audio. My blankets would be pulled off of me, my head would get hit into the wall by force, and I would even get up and stand in front of whatever this was and talk to it.

I think that you should get this app because not EVERYTHING requires premium like a few things do, but not a lot. Also the premium is only around $2.99 a month! It's so nice. I have been able to sleep so much better from this app. 
It also tracks your sleep if you press the sleep button in the center of your screen and you answer questions like how have you been feeling (it gives you multiple choice or you can choose other) then, you set your phone next to your bed on the charger and when you go to sleep, it tracks if you talked, snoring loud or tossing and turning. It also tells you your sleep score after six days of tracking your sleep with the app, and it tells you how much light sleep or heavy sleep. It's cool to listen to what you said in your sleep, what you did, or how much you snored. 
This app is very good for me because i haven't been able to fall asleep. But this app makes me fall asleep right when i turn on the white noise or sleep meditation.

This app does better than others I‚Äôve tried at actually recording noises during the night. They are usually miscategorized, but that is not a huge issue. 

Neutral:

It does an okay job of actually tracking sleep. It‚Äôs accuracy is far from perfect. It often ‚Äúmisses‚Äù my wake ups during the night, for example. But it‚Äôs at least as good as other trackers I‚Äôve tried and maybe a bit better. 

Bad:

It‚Äôs impossible to change their suggestions. It asked me what my ideal sleep schedule would be. However, my ideal is not realistic (since my job wants me there at 8 AM not 1 PM!). I didn‚Äôt realize I would never be able to change. The app now thinks I should go to bed at 1:30 and get up at 9. I could that for a couple days before getting fired maybe. 

It is very naggy. Get up when you wake up that‚Äôs 30 minutes earlier than usual? Nag. Go to bed earlier or later? Nag. I get that consistency is good, but this seems to be totalitarian in outlook. 

Speaking of totalitarian, the text suffers from a subpar English translation. It‚Äôs easily understandable, but just different enough to make you recall that it is, in fact, translated. It makes me wonder how safe my data is. 

Summary:

I probably won‚Äôt renew this when it comes due. It is okay, but for me the lack of customizability/flexibility outweighs the decent recording ability. I will look for another solution down the road.",2,False,Pretty Good Recording Quality,Copeknight,ShutEye Sleep Tracker Sound

Also, I usually wake up to use the restroom every night, and sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt even log that I woke up. Additionally, sometimes I will wake up before my alarm, and the app doesn‚Äôt track it. Finally, a lot of the recorded sounds are absolutely nothing (humming of my fan, etc.).

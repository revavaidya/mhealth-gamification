I like how 8fit has more flexibility with the exercises, you can make a more custom workout. I like how this app does ask about physical limitations, but leaves arms out? Like what about people with rotator cuff issues? I have a calcification on my tendon (“bone spur”) and have trouble with my right arm, I have been in PT awhile, so I know what I can do to modify the exercises but it would be nice to be able to limit the amount of arm exercises per workout because I can’t do that many and still be able to carry my toddler when needed. I was hoping to start at like 10-15 minute workouts, but I can just skip some of the exercises I guess (my toddler won’t even let me get through a whole PT session most days). I think they should have an option to replace individual exercises with similar ones that you prefer. I can’t do crunches, and I like that they have the combo crunch & leg lift because it would be easier on my back, but that doesn’t keep my toddler from coming over & laying on top of me. I’d rather do some standing exercises in place of lying down on days when she won’t stop climbing on me. I’m also still BF so lying on my stomach doesn’t really work for me either.

It would be better it was a two week trial to give me time to make a habit, get more familiar with the routines and get to a point where I “need” the app rather than make me decide before I’ve really had a chance to be invested. 

Additionally, I like other reviews, like that the app asks if you have physical limitations, however it only asks about: ankle, back, knee, leg, or wrist limitations. So it doesn’t take into consideration anyone with a hip, neck, or shoulder limitation.

Cons: My plan is extremely redundant and comically simple. They ask for your weight loss goals when you sign up and claim that you will get to your goal weight by a certain date. How? Magically? They offer zero dietary advice. I can not skip ahead or do two workouts of my plan in one day. The next day is locked. There are plenty of other supplemental workouts available. One says “if you’re having trouble losing weight try this”- should be a picture of a salad underneath it because no amount of exercise without a diet change will get you there.

The app itself is very frustrating to maneuver. I like the general idea of the programs. I was forced to choose a 30 day program- the workouts are 4 min long, I want to do 5 days worth in one day but it “locks” the other days. This is completely unnecessary.

I should not be shown ads at all considering I’ve already paid. There is no “account” area, really to understand what email address they are recording data or how it’s attached to my apple account.

I can accept that it was probably my fault for not reading well enough and clicking the wrong thing. A $30 mistake. 

Now I’m really wishing I hadn’t done that. This is ridiculous. Why go through the whole question thing at the start when your app just pretty much ignores them?

I indicated knee and wrist injuries. However, from the very first day there were floor exercises that require being on my knee. Which I cannot do because of (wait for it) my KNEE INJURY. 

Not 2 days later we’re multiple exercises that would have put serious stress on my wrist. Come on. What a waste of money if I can only do 2/3 of the daily exercises. 

The opening questions would be far more useful if they were actually incorporated in the plan. Or maybe there needs to be an expanded list of things to avoid. 

For instance, I specifically marked “no jumping.”  Guess what I got?  A plank jump. So I got a 2-for-1 on things I can’t do. Jumping plus wrist strain.

So my recommendation here is that you expand and pay attention to the limitation questions. Or, in the alternative, just get rid of them altogether and put a disclaimer before purchase that only fully functional people will benefit from your app. 

Not to mention I sent this as an email to customer support and go zero response.

Like other reviewers i was also charged immediately and would have liked a trial period. I choose three months since i wouldnt be able to afford a year subscription and my target weight was supposedly going to be reached within the three month time frame. 

I also use my apple watch and fitness apps to keep track of daily steps and calories burned. My watch and apps are very similar but the justfit app is way off from both forcing me to work even harder to burn calories to reach my goals when my iwatch says ive already doubled it though the step count on justfit is a few thousand steps ahead of my watch and fitness apps.

2018-10-05 21:53:59,"I’m one of those child prodigy genius turned horribly depressed adults, wondering why my brain quit working like it used to. I’ve been training for a couple months now, with my highest streak being 41. I can actually feel myself getting better and better. My memory in everyday life is better, I can focus on my tasks much easier, I’ve started having a MUCH easier time relating to others, and my once horrendous problem solving skills are through the roof. I can tell in everyday life as I come to better solutions much faster than I normally would have. I only have two scores below 400 now (total score above 500) and I’m so very proud of myself. Looking at the progress I’ve made is astonishing. The brain is a muscle like any other. If you want it to be fit, you must train like you do with the rest of your body. I’ve done brain games in the past but lost momentum because the games were just not that fun and it was the same game every day. With Peak, there’s so many different options to chose from and you never really get bored. I do have a few games I dislike playing because I’m not good at them, but it’s easy to remind myself why that means they’re the most important to do. 

I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone struggling. My depression and anxiety have gotten much more manageable as well, but I’ve been putting in my own separate work for that on top of the training.",5,False,Best App I’ve Spent Money On,RandaRenee,,Peak
2019-02-27 15:33:32,"Wow... I’m so glad I found this app. I was in a bad car accident a year and a half ago and my brain got seriously smashed up. As a result my memory (mostly short term) and math skills disappeared. I’ve been using Peak for about 2 months and I see significant changes in my memory abilities. Just a few weeks ago I was still telling any new person I talked to that I might lose my train of thought and I always felt self-conscious about my memory skills because it was so apparent when you spoke with me that they still hadn’t recovered. And just yesterday I realized that I haven’t had to excuse my poor memory to anyone lately, and in fact I go days where I don’t remember it’s an issue (not because my memory is bad but because it’s no longer such a problem!). And because of this app I actually learned that my math skills disappeared. I always just thought my mind was being lazy but when I saw it first hand how hard it was for me to do simple math on this app I saw the problem. It was really troubling and embarrassing when I realized - I used to be good at math - but I’ve been slowly getting better. So essentially this app has been my brain rehab!

But the customer service is a little crooked, I subscribed for a monthly subscription then I got this error saying only one Peak account can be associated with one Apple ID/ credit card method, well I did subscribe for a different account before so it makes sense (though it bugs me a little that they should have warned the customer before they charged them and alerted only afterwards) I logged in the other account to check and the Pro version wasn’t there either so I had to contact them. In the response they said they hung both accounts in idle because they didn’t know which one to officially put into the system, when my email came they put the Pro version into the old account (it bugs me for a second time because even though they solved my problem, they should had asked me which account I would like to make as a primary). I want the new account to be my primary so I ask them maybe, just maybe if they can change it, I would totally understand if they cannot, I just want an answer. Now I’m really irritated that my email went unanswered for days (the other email was answered within hours, so they possibly had to have read this one too).

But now apparently on day 14 I have to watch an ad for every activity. What happened to the days of buying an app for a couple of bucks instead of these ridiculous subscription models that cost and arm and a leg indefinitely. Unfortunately probably going to delete it if I have to keep watching ads for the basic daily “brain train” there are many other free ways to exercise my mind.

Update: the response on “we need ad revenue” is all fine and good, but if you want people to keep using your program, then either change the model so there aren’t as many ads in the middle, or change how many games you can play per ad or get shorter ads. As someone who fully understands the business model of app development I know there’s a balance to be reached here, and can confidently tell you that customers complaining about ads is something you should address in a more substantial way.

No redos or anything. That would be fine normally, but they then give you a summary of your overall performance which I feel isn’t accurate if you missed something on the instructions or if someone interrupts you while playing and something goes wrong. Also the instructions for the games can be complicated and/or slow going. There were some games with instructions that were too long or went through too slow for me so I skimmed them, but then messed up on an aspect of the game so my overall performance summary shot down on certain skills. The summary is actually very cool, but it kind of threw me off with how skewed my results became when I messed up on one game. I was actually considering paying for the game, but by not allowing me to replay the games for the day and having complicated/long game instructions makes it hard for me to determine its worth so I ultimately decided to just delete it.

2022-01-31 08:55:16,"Quick review.  I’ve been playing this at the pro level for a few months now and I enjoy seeing the progress and I feel like it helps me expand my mind and improve the skills that it focuses on which improves how I do my work and interact with others.  I enjoy it enough to have it be one of the first things I do on a daily basis.  It’s actually like a required step in my day.  Which brings me to the star reduction. 
Today I logged on and I had been somewhere in the 90’s for my playing streak.  Yesterday, I played it as I always do.  Today I opened it and my streak said 0 days.  I thought it was an error and would reset after I did the daily workout (because I’ve opened it before and observed that the interface behaved “differently”, I just assumed that this was a one off thing).  But after I did my workout, it updated the day count to one.  That is a big that seriously frustrates me.

I was very annoyed with Peak at first because there was an issue with me subscribing and I ended up getting charged twice. I was eventually able to get a refund on one of the charges and ended up with a lifetime subscription so I said whatever, might as well make good use of it since I paid for it. 

I’m actually kind of glad that I got the subscription because I’ve noticed that where I used to have memory problems, my memory has gotten significantly better. I also find that I am able to verbalize more eloquently than before and that my math skills have improved as well and I can be more focused on tasks than I used to. I feel that this game is definitely worth subscribing to in order to avoid the ads which I see a lot of people are complaining about.

2019-09-14 12:48:34,"They claim your brain trains itself and you become smarter the more you use the app. Then they have these 50 different games you play that focus on different things to show you your progress and make you think you are making progress. The issue I have with it is you only play 5 games a day, and sometimes I forget what the purpose of the game is and it takes a couple seconds to figure out what you are supposed to do. When you play everyday you are more likely to remember the object of the games and therefore you score higher because you are prepared for how to play, not because you are improving your brain function but simply because you know what to do when the game starts. They offer tutorials before the game but I often forget to click on them and there were a couple that even after watching I didn’t fully get. 

I’m an engineer, I fancy myself to be above average intelligence, but it’s certainly not because of this app. I deleted the app today seeing little to no value.

2022-09-19 14:34:43,"I’ve used this app for years and generally like it. My main complaint is the system that requires you to get an overall score before you can unlock new levels for games. It’s entirely possible for one area of focus to keep you from progressing in others which is extremely frustrating. I understand why this choice was made, but unless you add more content to all areas, you will reach a plateau and you won’t progress further, locking things you enjoy behind walls you can’t remove. Please either add games to all areas of focus, not just a few, so there is a better chance to raise the overall score or change that overall score as being what unlocks new challenges in each area to each area unlocks the more you progress. And no, it’s not a case of try harder. When I’ve spent hours attempting to better my score and I’ve reached a peak performance and I have limited choices in raising that score, it’s no longer only holding myself back, but the app design. I suppose a third option of lowering what’s required to unlock new content is also a tweak than a design change would also work.

To begin with, whenever I want to play one of the games, but I have to watch an ad to play it, I watch the ad, but then everything glitches out!

2019-06-30 04:04:04,"This app is great for training your brain, and improving your overall mental health. I have one complaint though: the progress you see is not entirely accurate. The score you receive is entirely based on the level of difficulty you’re playing at, and you don’t unlock the more difficult levels without having to grind out the beginner stuff. Some of the games at beginner & novice are a cake walk. It’s easy to perform perfectly, but scoring perfectly on a beginner or novice puzzle will sometimes give you a peak score of less than 400. As you unlock the harder levels, you’re able to score higher because that restriction is gone. This falsifies the results a bit, so it’s not reflective of your actual progress. Don’t get me wrong; this app is extremely beneficial, and tons of fun. It could just use one fix.

Developers: if you’re reading this, please remove the restriction on the higher difficulties for new users.

On the other hand, some of the games make little to no sense for their category and are limited by whichever hand you get with the game’s procedural generation whenever you launch. I’m talking about games like Happy River which rely thoroughly on RNG to generate a landscape where your luck can completely change the opportunities you have to score higher or lower, which have 0 business dictating the average score for something like “Emotion”. Games like Word-A-Like ask for very specific word combinations (which you’ll memorize with repetition anyhow) and yet that game affects your “Language” category.

The downsides are that is doesn’t explain how the brain map works. Is it better to have a larger spread map or a smaller spread. I would be interested in knowing more about the science that they use to come up with these statistics. The other down side is that the professions section of the brain mapping is very limited. I work in the mental health field and there isn’t even a broad category for my profession so I cannot compare my brain map to my colleges.

Women and men are different genders of the same species. They are not “opposite” which is defined as diametrically different. Diametrically means completely or directly.  When we perpetuate the idea that men and women are “completely different” we are choosing to disregard the shared experiences and focus only on the differences. This is how we encourage prejudice, by defining a group as “other” or different than your own.

Peak balances challenge with delightful interface in most games (e.g. compared to the ‘heaviness’ of Luminosity’s game design). I am feeling I can keep going until perfecting on all games as it feels like play time than exam time even though I check score each time...

Compared to other brain game apps I used in the past or currently use, Peak keeps a fresh edge, in its relatively large and diverse selection of games under each section, well targeted to specific brain training dimensions. I like the variety also certain twist on some games common to apps in this category. 

One drawback I have so far, & thus a deduction of 1 Star,  is the rather limited selection under ‘Coordination’ & ‘Emotion’, each with merely 2 or 3 games total right now. That’s just not enough games to either measure user’s performance properly or help user improve on those skills over time. I would say 5-8 games at least to be taken seriously. Or those tiers would also get repetitive than engaging very quickly.

I was frustrated, as I don’t want to spend money on video games. So I just decided to play my daily puzzles again. “Buy pro for infinite replays” it read when I clicked the daily puzzles. Anyway, I get that there needs to be some way to earn money and I think pro is a pretty good way of doing that, but this is straight up annoying! The puzzles in total take about 7:00 minutes.

Update to review below - I took off a star from my rating because at different times today I have tried watching an ad to be able to play a game and every time, I watched the full ad, but then got the blank black screen and no game. I hope this gets fixed, or I’m going to delete this app.

- Games: Some of the games are poorly explained.

You are also not informed that the games increase in difficulty when you rank up, or how the game changes once you do.

You are not told if you want high numbers or lower but I’m assuming higher is what you should aim for.

I saw that I got charged for a YEARLY subscription ($21 something) and not a monthly ($2 something). 
I contacted Apple support and they said no refunds could be given for this and I went to Peak support and they said they can’t do anything because it was through Apple (which is so stupid because it’s their app regardless of what I bought it through?)

 For example, in the games in the “Emotion” subject I have found the variable that most effects my score is coordination. In the game where you drag the smiling face to another while avoiding hiring the blocks, it is coordination that effects how well I perform. This has nothing to do with emotional intelligence. I would also like to see published research on these games. 

What makes them think that each game actually targets and has performance based on the skill they claim to be training? I understand that some areas are much easier to develop games for, but it is misleading to say it is training a certain area when that is not what determines the score you get.

I think the games are generally better in the other sections like mental agility, focus, math and verbal.

Now however it is more like pick a game, watch an ad, play the game, dismiss that game, watch an ad, pick another game, watch an ad…

The workout is now covered in ads too, every time you move to the next game there is another ad.

They also have games that discriminate against hearing loss instructing a higher score by listening to the change in sounds. Well, that would mean deaf people aren’t as smart because they can’t hear the sound and react faster?

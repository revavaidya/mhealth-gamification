I’ve learned to take care of my emotions, but the motivation to do things has never been there for me especially with my adhd. Doing things like going and getting a cup of water, washing my face, getting clothes off the floor or bringing bowls and plates down from my room has always been something that’s felt genuinely impossible. On top of all of that even, I’ve never had any motivation to stretch or work out. I’ve downloaded so many of these apps and they’ve all just been gimmicky and overpriced, and I’ve found they only made me feel worse because the reminders felt pointless and made me feel like I didn’t care about myself. With Finch, i not only feel reinforced that I care about myself, I also feel cared for by my finch, and I feel that by taking care of myself, im also taking care of him. In the past few days, I’ve done so much more with this app then I ever thought. Im really happy that I finally have some motivational help that actually works. I absolutely love finch and I actually couldn’t recommend it more. Also, I’d like to mention that I haven’t reviewed an app for like four years now because there’s never been an app that I cared for like this.

The way I use it is to stay focused on my very day tasks. So for instance, I can get pretty overwhelmed really fast especially since I have a physical disability, and I can’t stay focused to save my life. I start a task get distracted, and start a new one, so if I’ve been cleaning all day, but I never stayed focused on a task, it will seem like nothing got done. So on my app I have my entire day planned from start to finish. From the moment I wake up, get out of bed and brush my teeth, go do my tasks get ready to sleep and do it all over again. It’s literally all on the app. Now I’ve set everything up on my Journeys to make sure I’m keeping track on my process. My issue is that is that I can’t seem to get them to pop up on my goals for the day in order, so I have to sit there and move everything around to get my day started in order. I know it’s not a huge deal but it is time consuming and I get overwhelmed and distracted while moving everything around. I would really hope that in the future they could make it as in the journey goals for the day can have an order system for those of us that use the app like me. I think it would really be a game changer, instead of having to write down each day to get them to come on the goals section in order. That is literally my only issue, but again I love this app and I’m grateful to have it in my life!",5,False,CydCherry,One thing I would love to see changed…,Finch Self Care Pet

This is the most customizable and rewarding self care app with goals and journeys that you can edit and cultivate specifically to match your needs and wants. Getting to see your finch grow and Learn about themselves is so much fun and makes me excited to check in every day and send my finch out on an adventure. I love being able to choose my little ones colors, and outfits, and decorate their home, which keeps me motivated to complete task and earn rainbow stones to buy more stuff! If you need a friend to get you through and keep you motivated then I 100% recommend Finch! Plus the 2 seasonal events I’ve gotten to participate in so far have been so cute and fun. Ps: There is a free and paid version and the free version is 100% functional and add free. You really only miss out on a few features but nothing that ruins the app not to have. The paid version opens up the remaining features like various reflections and quizzes and stuff. I had Finch for 1 month before I paid for a year because I love it so much ($40 I think for a year 🤔 can’t remember).

Even if you don't always feel motivated to complete goals, it is nice to write in your reflections/rant about things. I like that you can view trends about certain people or even what brought you down/motivated you throughout the entire week. My finch is named DJ. He is so cute and I just love dressing him up. Besides the app itself being enjoyable, I think the team of people who work on Finch care a lot about it. You can tell they genuinely want to help people get through their days. This can be seen in the inclusiveness of the app and the lack of ads. There are no ads on Finch, and it makes the app less frustrating. The only thing you can purchase as an expansion to the app is Finch Plus, which gives you extra goals, reflections, and quizzes. Even then, the app never bombards you with in-app purchases. It jsut really makes it more comfortable for people to log in daily even if it is just for a few minutes. Also, like I said, Finch is very inclusive. You can change pronouns for your finch or even dress it up in pride flag themed clothing. Which by the way, the pride clothes are not just labeled as ""bisexual shirt"" or ""asexual shirt"" They are named by the colors so that it is more inclusive to everyone and have safe names for lgbtq+ people to buy.

They are basically just white noise but different because you can choose how long you want it to go for and they have so many fun noises. I also tried the finch plus free trial and I think that the creators were really reasonable about what you needed finch plus for or what not. You can listen to soundscapes without finch plus but you can’t listen to the mixes. That’s very reasonable to me. And I love the timers. Without timers and soundscapes I would never be able to focus.

So much is going on and I lost touch with literally everything and almost everyone in my day to day life. I downloaded it off a whim, didn’t really have much calling to do so, I just like birds, and I thought it was going to be another idle game. I opened it to find that it was so much better than that! I chose the gender of my finch.. and the first recommended name for it was “pickles” and I cried.. pickles is a nick name of mine from a very special person in my life, and it greatly reminded me of them, and made me feel better on the spot. I also have a way to get my feelings out in a healthy manner now rather than how I was before. Pickles and I have been growing every day, and slowly (but surly) have been getting better, I’ve already recommended this amazing app to about 6 of my friends, and my boyfriend, to all help us with our feelings, and to try to teach us how to better communicate our emotions (something I personally have never been good at) but since I’ve gotten attached to this app, and have been using it daily..

It was a particularly bad time, and I realized that I needed a more robust self-love plan to help me afterwards. I happened to find Finch, and it has helped me immensely with my every day care. (It’s definitely not the ONLY thing I do for my mental health care but it’s an important one of many!) It is SO good for helping establish good habits for yourself!! I recommend it to literally all my friends now. 

Developers: You have done such an AMAZING job with this app!! Seriously, THANK YOU!!!! I can’t afford anything right now (unemployed) and I was lucky enough to get a free sub from a guardian — that was amazing. It’s such a good idea. (I also love the guardian wall!!! It made me cry.) I love that there are no ads on the app and that there is no way to buy the rainbow gems, PLEASE keep it that way!!! Those things are what really make it feel like the app was built with my health in mind. 💕 The only request I have is: My baby grew up so fast!! I wish there was a way to make him a baby again. Perhaps if once he’s all grown up, we had the ability to either reset to the beginning, or if we could just choose a look for him (a growth stage) to stay in??

I also struggle with several traumas and last year received a diagnosis of OCD. My intrusive thoughts were absolutely crippling. I dropped out of school, something I loved more than anything, because I was throwing up in the parking lot daily when it was time to go to class. I could barely work or pay my bills, much less do dishes, shower, or take care of myself. This app helps me to heal my inner child, find a corner of peace, and just offers a safe place to go when the world is too much. I consistently use the first aid and soundscapes during panic attacks, and the journal prompts have come up many times during therapy. It is fun and exciting and healing to be kind and take care of a virtual creature, and tricks you into taking care of yourself. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Once I established a habit of using my app, my dog got in a tragic accident and lost his leg. This app helped me to have support and a community to help me through that, and to work through the trauma of the accident as well. I get emotional even talking about this app, it’s done so much for me. It has an amazing team that cares about mental health so much. I tell every one of my friends about it every time I see them.

I’m motivated to complete tasks earlier in the day. But once your energy is full, the rewards are minimal. My nighttime routines are the most important for me personally, and it would be helpful to have more motivating rewards.

Review: I love this app! As an adult with ADHD who struggles to prioritize taking care of myself, this is so helpful. It has the dopamine boost of a game/rewards, without the distractibility of an actual game. It’s very helpful to externally motivate me to take care of myself and basic life tasks, eg drinking water, listening to my body when it’s hungry, taking my meds, taking time for myself. 

Suggestion 2: I only wish the free version was more rewarding. Especially for event rewards, the non-Plus needs to have a few more guaranteed items and less random chests towards the end of the event days. I ended up just paying for Plus because I wanted the additional daily event rewards and options of clothes/decor to serve as motivation for me to stick with my goals.

I would also recommend maybe adding more things like some mini games you could play while they’re on a adventure! Or there could be a small little notebook where you could draw in and you could spend some rainbow shards (I think that’s what they’re called-) to decorate it with different things! Maybe some babycore, cottagecore, or something that you could decorate with! Another thing would maybe be a little thing that teaches you on different types of healthy coping mechanisms!

But your little finch pal depends on your taking care of yourself, that way it isn’t ONLY for you. Second. The atmosphere. This app really seems like some sort of game, you get rainbow stones from completing goals, stretches, anxiety relief methods and more. Then you can use said stones to purchase clothing and items for your finch. Third, and lastly, personality. YOUR FINCH HAS HIS/HER OWN PERSONALITY! I don’t know about you but to me that is freaking adorable! My finch likes corn after eating some on my first day using the app, on his first adventure he heard “Baby shark” and now it’s one of his favorite songs! Last night I even caught him dreaming about Baby shark! ITS SO CUTE! Anyways, if you’re looking for a good self-care/goal setting app, you might as well give this one a try :D",5,False,Crocheted_scales,This self-care app got everything right.,Finch Self Care Pet

It actually helps me to get what i need done, helps me stay motivated, set goals for myself, and achieve them! Its helped me to better my life while keeping my attention on my goal and the app so i dont lose motivation or focus! This little bird you raise has all sorts of questions about the world, every time you complete a goal he gains energy to then go on an adventure, with the more energy you gain the quicker he comes back home with various questions about the world. Your little bird will gain various likes and dislikes based on how you answer his questions and I love seeing how he changes and grows, seeing what he likes and dislikes, and even customizing my little bird and his house. These things help me to keep the app around and actually use it while completing my goals. Have you ever had someone tell you to treat yourself for completing a goal? Answering my bird’s questions and seeing him develop is like the treat for me, it keeps me tackling my goals and feeling good about it. Not to mention, sure, there are things you can pay for that would be cool to access, but the free version (since i do not have the money right now) is great by itself!

The SOS features are incredibly helpful, in addition to creating the small goals for yourself that you can find being necessary but giving you a sense of accomplishment. I can say that I have been able to be more conscious of my actions and feelings using Winston (my Finch) and I’ve even been able to use Winston to help me talk to others about my feelings and actions, because I want to show my Finch off! This is the first app I’ve stuck with to help my mental state and it’s been amazing. The developers are responsive to any questions and/or concerns, which is incredible.

That being said, there are a few things about the user experience that could be improved.
This app has a great library of grounding exercises and guided breathing techniques that I often use to calm myself down when I’m anxious or dissociating. However, these can (as far as I’ve seen) only be accessed through the “first aid” tab in a menu that only appears on the main screen of the app. This would be fine if there weren’t so many screens to go through before finally arriving at the home page of the app. There’s the regular opening screen, a quote/question, a pop up that asks you to rate your mood, and even the occasional “event” reminder that you have to get though to even access the home page. With no way to skip any of these preliminary screens and no other way to access the “first aid” tab, it can be very stressful to have to navigate through all of these pages when I’m already anxious and stressed. I think just adding a simple, clearly visible shortcut on the FIRST page you see that can take you to the “first aid” library would be a simple and effective way to solve this problem.

Buggy/slow on opening A few times when I’ve opened the app it freezes, or loads slowly (only displays my birb walking). I hard resettled it once or twice, but one time it (maybe in combination with other things happening on my device) made my phone freeze and I had to hard restart it. 2. Tags need some work I love the idea of tracking progress in the app, and I think the larger picture is helpful (eg the chart of how you’re doing over time, the day by day display of what you did well). But my newsletters categorize my positive/negative associations of my tags based on my status at the time of logging. Eg, the prompt was “what are you thankful for”, but because I said I was 2/5 in wellness, it associated all those good things (my family, dancing, etc) as negatives. 3. Can we get more visible language on how our data is handled? Hesitant to share too much because of this. 
The benefits outweigh the negatives though, imo. Listing negatives more as feedback!",4,False,MoreThanUseless,Where has this been?,Finch Self Care Pet

My acne started getting worse, and i would constantly be on my phone, rarely taking showers and stuff. My depressive episode was really bad and took over my life.

And worse of all, one of my journeys randomly decided to move EVERY SINGLE goal I’ve completed onto the current day and mark that I completed them that day WHEN I DIDNT. It erased my progress in the journey because it only registered that I completed over 20 goals in a single day, rather than spread out over a month which I did. I can’t even change them back to their original dates because like I said, when I set a goal to a different date it won’t actually work and will still be stuck on my current goal screen.

This app keeps me motivated to journal and be more mindful. I love that I grow my birb with every reflection. I also like how there are some surface level, light hearted prompts to answer on days where I can’t do a deep dive. The inclusiveness of this app is amazing, from being able to change your pet and micro pet’s pronouns whenever you want to having a wide variety of correct and specific pride items available year round to dress your finch in. The monthly events are great. The responses from your birb are so cute and I love all the thought the developers put into that aspect specifically. Even if you just do the free version, you still get access to a lot of things. It’s worth the money to me monthly, but not everyone has the luxury of having the extra cash to spend. They have raffles every month to win a sponsored, full, paid version of the app from kind people (guardians) who paid ahead for someone to help offset the cost if needed-which I also LOVE.

I think it's helped a lot in just a few days and I definitely would like to get the plus subscription when I can afford the year-long package. The main critique I have is that I wish whenever a new tag was detected for the first time, it would automatically pop up the tag editing menu to categorize appropriately rather than assigning the best guess, and it would also be nice if we could optionally categorize positive/negative/neutral. Reasoning for that being, for example, when reflecting on a poor mood I might say ""but X person made me feel a bit better!"" and then the app associates that person with negative moods even though it was a positive reflection, which affects the summary/graphs usefulnesses in that regard. Or maybe something like a ""silver linings"" section where you could put positive reflections even within negative mood periods.

If you can’t afford it there is also a gaurdianship program where people can become gaurdians and sponsor someone’s subscription and it’s given out at random!

First off I would like to say I think it’s very cool that the time you can spend on the app is pretty minimal, once you complete certain tasks, so you aren’t distracted by it all day like other “games”. That being said, it does really help set a positive tone for your day through motivational quotes. It challenges you to complete “simple” goals, which can sometimes trigger a spree of productivity— and at the very least, you can be proud to have accomplished the “small things”, that maybe you weren’t having the easiest time with. It acknowledges that sometimes we do not even think we can get out of bed, and it provides support, and motivation related to self-care. The collection of reflections are thought provoking, and help regulate emotions and keep grounded without being irrational even on a bad day. And on bad days, they encourage you to vent. First Aid feature is incredibly important and helpful, teaching ways to overcome anxiety, panic, etc. Anyways, the app is totally worth it even in the free version, but I’ve tried out the premium version and I must say it is absolutely worth the money.

It is fixed now, I think, but that makes me hesitant to keep using it especially as I had been relying on it a lot before. I really wish there was an option to save progress online vs. locally (on your phone) only to both avoid issues like this and to help me, with a very bad memory, not forget to create save files and thus possiby lose everything. I also wish the letters to say “complete” for a goal were not changed with the update to be so tiny…for some reason it’s stressing me out.

Addition: I’m really stressed out by the extensive customizing of the bird’s colors you have to do as it gets older. It would be fine if it were either more simplistic or you could access different colors for free, but as it is it’s turned into something I just can’t keep up with. And the problem is I’m sensitive to visuals, so if I don’t like how the bird looks I won’t want to get on the app. And, possibly a bigger problem, if I can’t get the bird to look like something nice or familiar, then I feel alienated from it and like the app doesn’t care about me.

However, there is ONE thing that makes me anxious. Althought you make slow progress day by day, i find myself getting closer to finishing exploring the forest.

The discovery and likes/dislikes are really such a key highlight of what gives my Finch a personality and keeps me wanting to continue to check in! Im hoping there is another area to explore after, maybe once you finish the forest you go onto another location, if thats true then ill happily say theyve went above and beyond expectations!

Aside from that hinderance that is worry-some to me, this app has been a live saver for me to vent to.

One thing I would like to see is an animation for flying when traveling to a new location. I was a little disappointed when I found that it was just the walking animation with a plane over it.

I’m glad to have joined Finch when it is still developing, because having things slowly be introduced is very pleasing to see. Also there is a bug in the game where all of my Finches clothes will disappear? Even though the clothes will still be equipped it’ll just be the body of the Finch. This happened quite often. There is also still quite a bit of lag when petting the Finch.

Somehow that makes it much easier to complete the tasks. 

One thing that I think would improve the app is if the user were able to create their own goals to be saved as suggestions, just as we are able to remove suggestions (which btw is one of my favorite features as my family and I don’t speak much and I can remove any suggestions related to that.) 

Overall I think this is amazing, that’s just one area of improvement I see.

I was too ashamed of how basic tasks and self-care were hard for me and didn’t have the courage to ask my friends to help keep me accountable to: brush my teeth, or go outside, or pray, or do something active even just a quick stretch. Task lists were overwhelming and carried a lot of guilt and shame for me. This app really motivated me by allowing me to celebrate small victories like just surviving the day, and that allowed me to build more resilience and do more things that are good for me. Some of the pre-set goal ideas made me feel like I wasn’t too far gone. I work with high schoolers and am always looking for ways to help them manage their self-care. I recommend this app highly. The paid features are nice, but not necessary to get a lot out of it. One of my friends just got sponsored and was moved to tears. That’s when I decided I’m actually going to start being a “guardian” and sponsoring as often as I can because there’s a lot of people who need to know that they’re seen, and someone cares for them to care for themselves.",5,False,Sphesch,Worth supporting,Finch Self Care Pet

I saw an ad for this and assumed it was just going to be another “Self help” app but its useless and riddled with ads. Finch has No ads. There is a subscription service but the app works perfectly without it and it’s not necessary. A lot of apps want you to make goals yourself or they set unrealistic goals for you. This app has plenty of goals that are easily attainable such as, Get out of bed and brush your teeth. Which for some people feel impossible, and finch understands that. You can also set your own goals and they have breathing exercises and so many helpful recourses. You can also name and dress up your little bird. Overall one of the best apps on my phone. If you are struggling and you’re thinking about downloading this Please just do it. It has helped me so much <3

I do have one issue, I cannot choose the order my goals show up in.

I am able to reflect on ANYTHING and it picks up on repetition of things that make me feel, good, sad, angry etc… I can look at my overview and see how I have changed throughout a few days. The coding is extraordinary, say you write about a certain event. It picks up words and makes them into hashtags so when you write about it again (let’s say ice cream) it will track what emotions and people you associate it with. If it doesn’t turn purple (the word) you can put a hashtag in front of it (#ice cream) and every time you talk about it, you can press it and see the stats!!

I use it to manage daily tasks as well as bigger and longer range goals, but also it helps me keep up with self-care when I am managing and juggling too many things. Further, having the game/virtual pet aspect is appealing to me and helps keep me engaged when I feel anxious and overwhelmed and just want to give up. This is why the app is so effective for me, it is cute and sweet, yet helps me do hard things and keeps expanding my capacity to be more organized and effective in my day. I think Finch is also great for anyone trying to replace some unhealthy coping and anxiety management habits with healthier ones. For instance if you play games or shop to manage stress, you get aspects of that in this app, but you are using “rainbow stones” instead of actual money and you earn them by taking care of yourself and journaling and creating healthy habits… I could say more about how the journaling is like CBT lite, and raising your personal virtual finch feels like it could be used as a way to do some self re-parenting work… But you should check it out and see for yourself.

However, there was a recent update where now you get new eggs to hatch up to four times a month. I thought it was just a one time thing, but now it seems to be endless. It bothers me because now my friends can easily get micropets that I worked hard for by checking in everyday. Not to mention, I’ve been working really hard for Oatmeal the llama and I was one person away from getting it, but then I got it by hatching an egg and my ownership of it feels empty now. And I still have that thing saying “invite more friends for this micropet,” but I already have the micropet. I wish they would remove the egg feature or at least make it less common and more challenging to hatch.

It alerts me gently when I’ve scheduled something and it is no punishment to skip a task. I feel no shame if there’s a goal that I just couldn’t get to that day. The breathing exercises are an amazing addition and I use them frequently. It really does feel like a pet that cares about you. I have gotten to the point that I do these self-care goals before the app reminds me, even forgetting about the app temporarily until I realize I’ve done my goals out of habit. 

Literally the only thing that I would change, more of a “tip” to the creators, is that it would be really cool if the notification on your Lock Screen said the name of your pet and had their little picture instead of it saying “Finch” with the logo.

A lot of them people are paid to give them or you have to be a paid user to be able to actually get anything out of the app. Self help has become a very expensive and easy business because most of the targets are people who are already at their lowest and you don’t get any of that on Finch. Even as a free user I absolutely love it and use it every day. It has a goal system that motivates me to complete things I struggle with while also making me give myself more credit for things I feel like I shouldn’t struggle with but do like getting out of bed.

I always seem to feel like the goals are sometimes to much of an obstacle and never seem to complete any goals and inevitably deleting the app. This app I’ve only had for a day but I love the goals it has for me. As I do suffer from man ice depression and am disabled from SJIA, things like brushing my hair or going outside are more of an obstacle some days. So for this app to give me a chance to actually feel like I’m doing SOMETHING even if it is baby steps (which I am always saying is how I move haha). I am truly grateful to the creators of this app. The time and effort you put in is astounding and with a 5 star rating to back you. I applaud your work and to your team I thank you all.

Update: I’ve used finch for almost a year and am still in love with it. I can’t afford plus but they make it so easy you don’t even feel like you don’t have a premium feature.

At night, I usually lay in bed and check off the things I did, and then work on some of the prompted exercises for the evening- reflection of what made me happy that day, talking about my friends, planning tomorrow, doing stretches, listening to rain sounds. There’s so many to do and they’re quick and easy but really make a difference in my mood levels and stress levels.

I haven’t even paid for anything on this app as of yet and the expansive choice of free selections is astounding. The only thing I will say is if you’re running a soundscape, I’ve found the app runs slower or crashes more often.

It has a variety of psychologically useful exercises but I only use a couple, and the app is really good about rewarding you for baby steps. If you’ve ever been so depressed you can’t get out of bed, then you know the importance of goals like “stand up for 10 seconds” or “look in the mirror and say ‘I can do it.’” So yeah I think it’s a great app. I’ve had depression since I was 12 and I’m soooooo sick of toxic positivity culture and the basic mental hygiene advice that people are now just discovering because of covid. I’m the Goku of depression, okay. Sadness is my gym. And I like Finch. There.",5,False,KellyhatesiTunesrealtalk,Cute and surprisingly engaging,Finch Self Care Pet

Some days I feel so crappy, but there’s something so wonderful about always having my finch with me at any time of the day or night.

Finch also will have you set goals that you want to keep going daily to help lead to a better life! You can bond with your amazing Finch (shoutout to pancakes 🥞!) and grow with them while designing your Finch, your Finch's outfit, your Finch's clothes, and so much more! One of the things I love most about Finch is that it will help you feel better and form good habits. Finch also is very fair with what you can have with or without the plus/premium option. You can have Finch for free and still occasionally get the plus/premium for FREE for about either 3 days or up to a month! Even without the plus/premium option though, there are so many things you are still able to do! I would recommend Finch to anyone who loves a adventure, making new friends, needs some new goals/habits, and is in need of a healthy community to grow on.

Honestly I’m writing this review so hopefully development will bring this up: this game would be really improved by in-app games such as mini games designed to lower stress or maybe even physical symptoms of trauma response (it exists and since this game is geared towards self care it really fits). I also wish they’d make it so you could join your little finch pet on adventures, actively make decisions with the pet, and/or have opportunities to help manage the petpet while your main self care finch is out and about.

I really appreciate and have often used their “First Aid”section, which has a variety of calming exercises for when emotions are heightened. My only complaint, and its pretty frustrating, is no matter the reflection prompt, the app makes reflections merge into one page per day. It makes it confusing when I fill out something like  “3 things I look forward to” and then also reflect on a “bad” day. Since the reflections will be listed in the same area, the tags end up assigning the wrong emotion, or even assign things that bring me joy as “bad” things throughout the day.

I know a lot of people that would rather do things in return for something, than to just do them. This app can also teach you to just do things “to do it” or “just to be nice.” I say that because instead of getting that one material thing like money, you can get the reward of feeling nice for doing it.

I’m in sixth grade I and use it every day. It’s really nice to vent your troubles to. The idea of a little bird representing you and your time on Finch is just so cute! The first aid and the quizzes are my favorite part. When I get panic attacks the panic breathing helps a lot. Taking the quizzes gives me a better sense of how I’m doing. I like Tree Town. I have tons of friends who use Finch. What was annoying to me was why after I added the first one to tree town, instead of getting 600 rainbow stones I only got 10. Also I keep getting the same exercises over and over again. I used to actually write in Finch a whole lot more but after a while it gets less and less appealing. Maybe something that could change would be to make the entries more real. Something I really love though, is the check-ins! It’s awesome how Finch sends me a notification to see how I’m doing. It always seems to be at the time I need to use it. Makes you wonder…ha just kidding. The quotes are being re used though. And the Weekly Feels Mail! Super helpful.

There’s a few things I would like to be added or changed, and I understand if you can’t do it

#1  A lock option for the stores
A lock option would just be a button shaped like a lock, that when clicked, would lock the current contents of the shop so it wouldn’t refresh until you unlock it. I think this would be nice so that if you want to get something but don’t have enough stones, you can just lock the shop and wait until you get the needed amount without worrying about the item leaving the shop

#2  Changing some of the Finch+ Things

Not everyone can afford to get Finch+, and there are still some great things to use, but I would like it if you could make some of the yoga exercises available to normal users, as most people find yoga more relaxing than stretching. And maybe make the thunder or Fire (or both) soundscapes available to non-plus users

Honestly, I thought I was going to delete it after I got it, but NO!! It’s so fun for just relaxing. When you download it, and open the app you get an egg and get to choose the name, and gender of your Finch, (They even have “they/them” options!) After you’ve chosen your little friend, you can write how your feeling, memories, and other things. Finch has a “First Aid” button that has things that may help with your anxiety, panic attacks, breathing, and so much more! There are soundscapes for those who enjoy them. Your Finch goes on adventures to find new things out in the world, but you’ll need energy points in order to do this. You can get these energy points by writing, and doing tasks in the game. You can buy clothes and accessories to personalize your Finch with crystals you can get in game! Also, how could I forget that you can invite your friends and interact with them in tree town! I highly recommend this app, and there are so many other things you can do. 💕",5,False,KerryML28,Super cute!,Finch Self Care Pet

What’s different about this app is that I feel rewarded for completing my daily goals / routine, and it pushes me to complete them again the next day to get rewarded again! Using a rewards system as a form of positive reinforcement is so much more helpful for me than simply having a list of things as a routine that I need to complete with no “push” to do those things.
Not only that, but I have not found an app yet that has as many resources under the free option as this app. Having several options for first aid, to help my anxiety attacks and panic attacks, to help ground me, is immensely appreciated. Being able to take quizzes to check up on my mental health is a nice bonus.

Living at school with ADHD has been really hard for me. Things from making sure I do laundry in a timely manner, or showering often, or drinking water; these things I can’t put on the calendar, or put on an alarm, because if I don’t have the time or energy to do it at the time I put it for, it simply isn’t getting done.

This app is adorable. The art style is playful and casual enough to be more attractive to me than a to-do list, and there’s so many little features that help me so much nowadays. I can set tasks to repeat on certain days, be completable several times in a day (such as drinking water) or carry over to the following day until it’s done (such as showering or doing laundry). I have little goals for every day like “take medication”, “put on clean clothes”, and things like “text my family that I love them” once a week. These are little things to me, but sometimes I can’t bring myself to get out of bed. Sometimes I forget my medication one day, which snowballs into several days. Sometimes I lose sense of time, and it’s suddenly been a month since I texted my parents.

It’s all little things, but god, do they pile up. And completing them, whenever I can, feels like an achievement now, and a weight off.

It’s the only app I’ve found that doesn’t penalize you in any way for missing a day, missing a goal, skipping a goal for any reason. There’s no obvious negative reaction if a streak is broken (that I’ve seen) so I don’t feel guilty for not being able to do it. HOWEVER getting to check them off and getting TIME SPECIFIC REMINDERS !!! To complete them is very rewarding and makes you want to do it to make your little bird happy.

I like the “how are you feeling?” Check in when you open the app. It’s nice to have that moment of reflection, even just for a second. I feel I can be honest to the birb as they won’t judge me for any answer I give. There’s zero negative reaction.

Getting to visit friends is so fun! It and the adventures are a nice way to feel like you’re taking care of it, without the stress of an actual health system. I like getting to remind my friends that I’m thinking about them, and getting to see eachothers birds together is precious. Especially with long distance friends!

I also enjoy the questions! They give me something to ponder and I often learn something new about how I feel on a subject! And I like that you get good things regardless of the answer. There’s zero right or wrong and it’s lovely!

All around I am VERY pleased with the app! Will continue to use it and will definitely reccomend it to people! If it becomes possible in my budget any time soon I will consider upgrading for sure!",5,False,LilMonsta321,My favorite self care app thus far.,Finch Self Care Pet

If your wondering if you should get this you 100% should. Basically how it works is you get a egg that hatches in to a bird. You name the bird and the. set goals and set stuff that you have to do. It’s motivational because it will reward you with rainbow stones if you complete tasks. With the rainbow stones you can purchase clothes and furniture for your little bird. The bird goes on adventures and learns something new every time and your bird will tell you what happened and what they learned. Your little bird levels up. You can add friends that have the app to show you support them and you’ll get 600 rainbow stones. There is SOOOOOO much more in this app but you have to get it to find out. :) This is very motivational and helps you be the best self that you can.

My friend recommended this app to me while I was going through a tough break up. Instead of distracting myself with apps like Insta, I made the effort to open Finch and interact with myself. The reflections I’ve made in this app have acted as a catalyst in my growth and healing, all thanks to the prompts that make you think about things you would’ve never thought were something to think about. I use the journaling aspect to write down any thoughts or feelings I have, and constantly ask myself why I have those thoughts or feelings, which usually leads to a deeper understanding of myself and my behaviors. 
The addition of having a baby bird to take care of is perfect for encouraging daily interaction and makes the app ten times cuter. My favorite aspect is that you can add your friends as “nest neighbors” and send them “good vibes”. Let’s me know that I’m not alone :)

I realized that although I love games that have streaks, it de-motivates me when I lose a streak after not logging in one day. With Finch, there aren’t any notable streaks to worry about, and it feels freeing. It makes me think “It’s okay if I forgot to wash my face this morning. Just do it tomorrow.”

Yesterday, I had a really bad anxiety attack in the morning and when I opened the Finch app and logged my mood, I noticed that the goals were moved down and I was provided with gentle reflection prompts. I’m not sure if that was programmed intentionally, but it really did make me feel better.

That being said, lately I feel the app has been changing drastically and not for the better.  While I understand that money rules the world, I thought that Finch would be a great way for me to work through my mental health as I cannot afford a therapist. Lately though, in app it feels like everything pushed you towards buying premium. You get shown things that only premium members get but you can't interact with without being prompted to buy premium. The events are super cute, but you can't get the new micropet and you only have a chance at getting the limited time furniture and clothing. I feel like I'm being teased and made fun of with how much premium content is waved in my face only to be unaccessable behind a pay wall.

I used to open this app every day, track my emotional dysregulation, keep up with my to do list, and check in with friends who also use the app. Now it feels like another chore and another pay to win game. I'm really disappointed.",1,False,HangryLesbian,Used to be Better,Finch Self Care Pet

While currently dealing with severe anxiety and depression this is an exciting opportunity to use mindfulness to the best of my ability. 

Even only using it for one day as of right now, the amount of joy it has brought me is incredible. The idea of raising yourself up alongside a baby animal is an incredible tool for compassionate people. The prompts you get to reflect on how you’re feeling, and can get you to stop running and moving so fast and consider mindfulness, something I struggled to find or make time for previously.

I love how Finch turns checking off daily, weekly, or long-term goals into a game. I also love how you can customize your goals by adding a time, how many times you do this a day, etc. It’s incredibly satisfying to see all my goals and tasks organized into “journeys”, and how my progress is reflected through my self care best friend, aka my Finch. Personally, I think this is one of the best apps out there. 
	My suggestion is that for a goal you want to do multiple days a week, like Friday and Saturday for example, you can set a different time for each day, so that the task you want isn’t on the same time each day. For example, the time of the task could be 7:00PM on Friday, but 2:00PM on Saturday. I hope that this will be added in the next update.

I know you are able to pick a mystery box sometimes, but it’s not enough, especially since we can’t actually purchase stones with real money.

It helps me so much with building habits, routines; helping me with self love and confidence. The way it’s created to help with self care as a game is incredible. It especially helps me out as someone with ADHD because it is stimulating enough with so many different things to do in it. 
However, I do have one minor complaint. I love the reminder system for tasks as I’m a very forgetful person. The system to set the notification for is a scroll wheel on IOS, which I normally love because it makes it very easy. But for some reason on my phone, it doesn’t let me scroll through normally. I have to set it one number at a time, meaning i may have to do a total of 30 swipes to make the reminder for say, 6:30.

My name is Shayla & I have been using this app for about two weeks now. I really like how this app doesn’t flood you with notifications to where you end up snoozing all of them. I turned my app into a widget almost like I have a window to my finch & it updates the cover based on if you have any new things to check up on.

The reason I am leaving this review is to applaud an app for being ad-free in their free version. I would not have kept this app if it became another subscription service in order to use. 

A suggestion that I think could improve the income of devs is to provide a “buy” feature to receive the premium content. I am so fatigued by everything become a monthly or annual subscription, but I would absolutely do a one-time payment ($30-$50) for the premium access of this app. 

Additionally, you could move subscriptions into paying it forward for others & Hall of Guardians content. All people who are currently paying a subscription could be connected with to see if they want to continue helping pay it forward or to just continue their access.

I don’t necessarily have high hopes for this to become a reality, as I know it would dramatically change some features on the back end with internal purchases, but I do wish this app that has such a high potential for community building takes a step in that direction!",5,False,smmicks,Fantastic app—Suggestions for the Devs,Finch Self Care Pet

- The finch is so adorable and so genuinely want little Macha to succeed and grow, so I make sure to complete my tasks

I want to use this review to not only share how it has helped people, including myself, but also to shed some light onto the beauty of the community that this app has created along the way. The idea of being a guardian is excellent, not only that, it’s affordable too. I was surprised to see that it was only $8 a month to sponsor someone. I highly applaud the creators for keeping this cost low, as it is likely the reason why the Finch app has so many guardians in the first place. 

As someone who’s been lucky enough to be sponsored twice now, and has gotten the opportunity to explore finch plus, I feel the desire to give back to the community and become a guardian myself, because I know that just by sponsoring someone, I can help make their days just a little bit easier to get through. 

It’s really quite calming to see so many strangers come together to help each other get through rough times, and it gives me hope that it’s not to late to restore love for one another in humanity. We all need someone, or something, to go to during hard times, and the Finch app has truly done an amazing job at sharing that kindness that we all needed.

Sometimes you’ll do things for others that you won’t do for yourself - I get to take better care of myself by taking care of the finch. Everything is just so cute and positive.

My favorite part is the journaling - you get to reflect on the actions you take or the moods you and it makes you more aware of how the small decisions are impacting your life. You can also journal about the large decisions too.

The journaling is also my least favorite part because I love to journal, and that can be a “hack” to give my finch all the energy it needs. I can just journal and avoid the other goals. But on a bad day, I guess it’s good to have because your finch can still adventure if you’re not motivated.

I also love the soundscapes and breathing exercises. If you’re extremely stressed and have bad habits (smoking, etc) and you think, “ugh what do I do?” You can just open your finch and have a ton of healthy exercises 1 min, 3min, 10min, 1 hour to help you.

For reference, my resting shallow breathing rate is typically around 6 to 10 breaths per minute, with deep breaths taking longer and the rate slowing down if I’m paying attention to my breathing. Intentionally slowed breathing brings me down to about 3 breaths/minute without much effort and I’ve sustained 0.67 breaths/min for upwards of 20 minutes before.

This app is made for people who want/need a little help in their life.

The free version is amazing, and you don’t need to pay for it to be very useful and enjoyable. Plus, it doesn’t shove the payed version down your throat which I very much appreciate.

The reward system makes it easy to feel like I’ve accomplished something right away every day by doing a few tasks, and each task completed reduces the amount of time your little bird friend spends on their adventure. There’s no shame tied to skipping goals or pushing myself too far, and it encourages setting attainable goals on bad days too, like “get out of bed” or “stand up for ten seconds.”

It is also very fun to have friends to visit and send good vibes to.

I don’t have to worry about feeling pressure to do the goals, it sends kind reminders and I get to send them to my friends.

Finch is great for tracking my feelings, light journaling when I feel like it, and holding myself accountable for tasks that I tend to fall short of when I begin to feel down. I’ve added Mittens (my ‘birb’ friend) as a widget to my main screen to remind myself to do important things like take my vitamins, make my bed, and have escalated myself to now having reminders for donating items I don’t use, and to call old friends each week. 

I love that some of the suggested things are good mini-journaling prompts (I hate journaling) and breathing exercises, meditation assistance and grounding techniques that my therapist uses. It keeps my ‘toolbox’ of good balancing practices at my fingertips. It’s nice to know when I’m feeling anxious or stressed, Mittens is there for me. Literally. Sometimes Mittens actually sends me thoughtful thinking of me notifications on my phone. I feel warm seeing it, and love interacting with my mom and sister’s birbs through the app.

It is such a cute way of helping kids overcome their problems and anxiety. I am going through some rough anxiety, throwing up and getting sick because of worries.

1. I think you should make those breathing exercises come up at least twice a day. They really help loosen my chest when I feel sick.

2. Have some sort of puzzle, where you can sort out your feelings and so you can see how the anxiety is just making the things look bigger and scarier than they actually are. Then at the end, have a result of how to calm yourself and get yourself out of those worries.

3. Make it a little easier to get rainbow stones. I love the idea of dressing up my finch, but sometimes I REALLY want something and I don’t have enough, I go back the next day, and it’s gone.

4. In the dress up area, I think ALL of the items should be available to buy at all times. That way you can set a goal and save up for something without the worry of it going away the next day. Maybe then you wouldn’t need to make it easier to get rainbow stones?

The content you get in this app is phenomenal.

 Tons of journaling prompts, several meditation and breathing exercises with visuals and timers. To do lists and cute stories from your pet that are just so sweet that you will be full of fuzzy feelings (and the very interesting option of journaling about each pet storyline and meditation exercise to explore how you feel about it).

This has helped me develop healthier habits, stay in contact with my friends and family through the good vibes in tree town, and overall become a better more observant person!

One recommendation I have for the app though is that we should be able to spend more time with our finch instead of them exploring all day. One of the most important reasons why I like this app is because it makes me feel like I’m not alone, like the Finch is here with me. And I feel like most mental health apps are just journals and reflections, and I don’t want that anymore - I just want to feel less lonely - so I wish to see us spend  more time with our finches.

Actual review:
The pal is very cute, there’s lots of different ways to gain energy to send them out on adventures, and they even develop their own little personality by asking you questions! You can get rainbow stones easily as well by doing the little self care tasks and use those to buy them clothes of all kinds. You can also have neighbors on the apps by putting your friends on. Although when I saw the tree town thing, I almost expected a way to make a little birdhouse for them which would be really cool. Maybe a feature for the developers to consider in the future? But I like that you can invite friends and have them be your neighbors in the app.
I decided to use this app because I’m bedbound due to a broken leg and my depression took a serious turn. The breathing exercises, the gratitude jar, and the reflections have been really helpful. Normally I just ride out my depressive spirals on my own, but this app makes for a good guide to figuring out your feelings.

Self care is so important, but with my mental health issues, I sometimes feel that I am not worthy of it. But Finch solves that problem for me. Even if I have trouble loving myself, it’s impossible not to love my little virtual pet! I named him Coruja and he makes me so happy! Watching him go off on little adventures and coming back to tell me about a new discovery is precious! And sure I’ll do a breathing exercise or meditation if he’s there with me, but it would be hard to motivate myself on my own.

The app’s design is pleasing and easy to use, there’s just—so—much to do that it’s a lot to figure out at first. And while there is a premium version, you can do tons with the free one. I would love to purchase it as anyone who created such an app must be wonderful people, but I don’t have the money right now.

If you feel like you don’t have much to live for, maybe a little bird who wants to grow with you is something? Knowing that Coruja is there to grow along with me is touching. I won’t give up on myself if it means I had to give up on him.

I started out with terrible mental health and  it was hard to enjoy the little things. After about 3 weeks of using it, it has shocked me and make me smile more.

 First of all, THERE IS NO ADS! EVEN WITHOUT PREMIUM! 

Second, 
there are plenty of things to do. There is TONS OF VARIETY, and I had problems with not having that in other mental health apps. There are things to do like take quizzes, do morning and afternoon and night time yoga poses, listen to soundscapes (you can still listen to them out of the app and while your phone is turned off with or without premium), and more!

Third, 
there are many things you can do without premium! There is no purchase to use the whole app in general it’s just for tiny upgrades like longer soundscapes, more quizzes, or other little perks. But there is still tons to do! Which made me SO happy! I’m glad there were so many things to do!

Fourth,
There is a reason to play the game! There is a little finch you can get that you can learn, play, dress up, and interact with. I find this feature absolutely adorable.

Personally, I use the goals the most— it’s nice to start the day and set one or two manageable goals, and know that I’m actually able to do them. Favorite feature is probably the little push notifications from your bird (it’s not excessive and you can turn it off if that’s not your bag, but I love the little messages of encouragement), and when the birds skip when you give them extra energy. 

Keep in mind, it’s a small team of devs, so there are still a couple things being worked out, but they don’t interfere with the core functionality and benefits of the app, and they're really active with the community. (Community is also fantastic & really supportive). Save data is all local to your device, so you know they’re not selling it, and all my interactions with the team have been great so far.

For example once I wrote about wanting to make more confident decisions and because I used the word confident it tagged it and categorized it as positive.

Using it as much as I do, there are a couple things I’d like to see in the next bug fix:

1. When I add new goals, my list of goals gets shuffled. I have them organized roughly by time of day, and I’ve got tons of them, so it’s a bit annoying to have to resort thirty-forty goals. Thankfully, they seem stick after that first resort, but if I add another goal, it goes again.

2. The stretching exercise example clips sometimes flash a black screen before restarting. It’s not a concern for me, but I don’t know if it could potentially be a trigger for folks with seizures.

3. On the topic of stretching exercises, I think it would be cool to have some written instructions for stretching as well, namely where you’re supposed to feel the stretch. I often wonder if I’m doing the stretch right on the ones I’m not familiar with!

Been using it for the past few months and I’m so happy with it and grateful to the developers. They truly care about their users and are extremely thoughtful in their designing to be as inclusive as possible. 
I love that they put all the self-care things that I need into one app- to-do’s, journal reflections, habit tracking, stretching/yoga/breathing exercises, grounding techniques for panic attacks, even lovely soundscapes for white noise! 
Maybe next guided meditations? That’s just me being greedy :p
The gamification of taking care of the finch and giving it outfits and decor for its house is so fun and sweet. When your finch asks you questions about what they see on their adventures, it can feel like a mirror to reparenting yourself. 
This is my one counter to Black Mirror style technology lol. Finch is technology being used for good and genuinely backed by love and care.
 I appreciate that Finch does not make exploitative decisions, when they could so easily be tapping into the self-care “trend” where people seem to be advertising that they can sell you wellness for a steep cost or getting every penny they can out of their users through micro transactions or splitting up access to each feature.

And plus, the game is so cute overall. Opening the app always gives me a little smile. 

One thing though— maybe there should be another way to earn gems besides completing tasks? Because each individual task only gives you about 3-5 gems, and it takes multiple days to unlock gems for when you cleared a certain number of journey days. Personally, I think more minor tasks such as making your bed could be about 10 gems, and more major tasks such as vacuum cleaning your room could be 15-20.

Maybe there could be another event system, like a leaderboard where you can get gems depending on how many goals you’ve achieved. Or, it could be like this but with friends— the friend with the most number of goals cleared can earn a number of gems.

I’m sure there’s a whole world of emotional variety this app would be good for, if it was introduced. 

2) variety in stretches. I just think it’s time we added some new ones to each category, especially so I’m not doing the same three for “lying down” in the morning when I’m low energy.

3) glitches. Sometimes the app will just close randomly, or start flashing rapidly- I notice this especially when Beepo comes back from an adventure. I’d just like a full check for bugs soon in general really.

4) Keeping the energy earned if I have to stop in the middle of an exercise. I do a lot of my midday tasks while I’m at work, and get interrupted. If I have to stop, I hate that I lose any energy gained even if I was almost done, and have to do them all over again. It’s especially frustrating for breathing exercises",4,False,irratehomo,I love my little beepo,Finch Self Care Pet

Things I love:

- Easy to use and engaging.
- Great built-in goals and activities.
- Awesome insights and stats.
- Helpful journaling prompts.

What I wish they’d add/change:

- Make it possible to add “optional” goals or mark a goal as “not applicable” when needed (example: work goals aren’t applicable on holidays).

- Hidden posts/notifications for sensitive goals or entries. This would allow us to customize how certain goals show up in notifications and give us an option to hide entries (maybe an eye icon you tap to reveal).

- Make it so we can communicate or share certain posts with tree town friends. It would also be cool if we could post a status update. This could be very helpful for things like addiction sponsors and reaching out.

- Better formatting and labeling. Some prompts are labeled, others are not. Also, paragraphs get removed when you edit a reflection. Would be cool if we could add photos and links. Would also be nice if we could bold text to create headers.

- Improve tags to include more categories and actions.

It has incredible customization, great exercises (you can choose if you want to lay, sit, or kneel for morning stretches, how long you want to do a breathing exercise for, etc.). You can build “tree towns” and add goals to appreciate or spend time with specific people or pets. You can go on specific journeys and create goals that fit those journeys, reflect on goals, etc.

One critique is that sometimes creating goals in advance can be hard to do, the app will glitch out and think you are trying to create a goal for today. Another thing is I would like to see more customizable timers— I want a 2 minute timer for brushing my teeth!

I also wish that some notes were kept separately rather than separated all together by the day. Example: I feel like the dream diary could be its own separate book, and all positive and all negative reflections could be in their own book rather than everything being included into a huge reflection that day. By doing this, if you want to look at all the positive things that you have done you can simply go to a ""positive reflections book"" and it'll show all the positive things that you have written about.

It’s been such a meaningful addition to my life! I actually had a few small thoughts and suggestions (these in no way take away from the experience of the app, I just thought that they were fun ideas). 
1 (this is the silliest). My Finch, named Firrell, goes to bed in what seems like a bright room, and I was wondering if there could be a light switch feature for when you’re ready to put your Finch to bed to make their room darker (I try to change Firrell into pajamas so that they’re comfortable, and I know that they aren’t alive, but I worry about their quality of sleep in a bright room).
2. Can there be a feature to sort items by collection? Like, I could filter my bedroom furniture by the space collection, or the magic collection, or the spring flowers collection. 
3. Can there be a larger calendar feature so that we can easily go to say, December 30th, and we’d be able to check to see our entries? I know I can do that with the mood tracker, but it’s less intuitive. 

Again, this app is so amazing, so thank you for all of your hard work!

I downloaded this on a whim from an Instagram ad, not sure if i would ever use it, and here I am 2 months later, still using it every day. It’s a fun and helpful way to “reward” yourself for self care. 

I have a suggestion, though! I would love it if i could make little sub-lists like “Prepare for work” or “Clean Room”  or “This Evening”, to help break down smaller time periods into manageable to-do lists, rather then just having one huge “Today” to-do list. I have ADHD and Finch has been so helpful, but I believe with sub-lists Finch could be even more useful and impactful.

I love how there isn’t a pressure to go into it all the time, and when you do come back there isn’t any shaming about not logging in for a few days.

I also like the option of having friends in your “tree town” and getting to positively interact with them. It’s fun to watch your friends’ finches grow with yours and have them go on adventures together.

I find the check-ins and the “thought dumps” really helpful, but there are a variety of ways to practice self care on the app, like stretches, soundscapes, and anxiety/depression quizzes. 

Lastly I like the customization of the finches, especially the pronoun option. But I love being able to get new clothes for my finch!

Custom messages to people in your tree town
More quizzes and deep dives! These have been some of the most helpful reflection tools for me. 
More response options to talk to your finch after their adventures

A different way to view your past goals and reflections. I really appreciate the ability to look back at reflections from other days, but the current scrolling mechanic can be a real headache if you want to find something from more than a few days ago.

One thing I would say though is that I really dislike that there’s no option to choose how you feel about a specific reflection, the app just assigns an emoji and “positive/negative” to your words for you. I find myself self-censoring or wording things terribly to try to get an “accurate” reflection, rather than just writing what I’m actually thinking about. For example, I tried to write a song lyric that I find really uplifting, but it has the word “kill” in it so it’s automatically recorded as a “negative reflection” with no way to change that. Automation and mood detection is a fancy trick and all, but I feel like a self care/mental health app should know that humans are more complicated than that.",4,False,dnshfisbdhsjc,"Cute, could use some improvement",Finch Self Care Pet

Three things that could take it to five stars for me:

1. Once the “energize” bar is maxed out, allow the bird to go on another adventure. Otherwise, there’s no motivation to continue completing goals once they’ve come back from their adventure for the day. 

2. Add some anxiety reducing puzzles/games. A lot of time when I open the app I feel like I have nothing to do - and I only downloaded it yesterday. I don’t want to just endlessly journal, which gets to be the only option very quickly. 

3. You should be able to put your goals for the day in order. The random order isn’t really helpful for me and doesn’t allow me to utilize this app in place of other checklists. 

Love the idea, the graphics, and a good bit of the playthrough, but I hope the developers make sure changes along these lines. Otherwise, I see myself becoming bored with the app very quickly.

A lot of finch is hidden behind a paywall, but there is LOADS already available for free. So it’s not forcing you to pay for the good stuff. Just for extra stuff.
You get rewarded for little things and I find that super helpful :) it might not be for everyone and that’s okay! But I’ve found finch fits perfectly for me and my personal set of needs :)

Not so easy to unsubscribe.

The FAQ in the app says I can unsubscribe from Finch Plus by going to the in-app shop at the top right of the screen.

But there is no option to unsubscribe.  In the settings of the app, it shows that you have Finch Plus active but weirdly enough only that line of the settings page is non-interactive.

I had to search for a way to unsubscribe on the internet and found that it’s only possible by going in to the iPhone setting Apple ID subscription page and canceling from there.  

There were many comments on the resulting website of people who have been charged a year of subscription fee because they didn’t realize they would automatically be charged after 7 days and the app gave no warning before the end of the trial.

I can understand offering a free trial and not reminding them before the subscription is over, but to make it impossible to cancel the subscription inside of the app and to offer no information on how to actually cancel the subscription is just a very disingenuous way of doing business.

2) You have OPTIONS but the format is not overwhelming. You can take quizzes, write affirmations, practice mindful breathing, listen to calming sounds, reflect on feelings, goals, and achievements.

Is there room for improvement? Always. I'd love if my finch responded to some basic verbal prompts or if the finch asked the reflection questions. But these are wishlist ideas and the app is incredibly complete and polished, ready to assist people, haven't experienced any bugs all week, it's in active development with new features and contents, and a large online active community.

I do note that the self-care motivation is extrinsic. Some people really need that extra motivation and accountability to take care of themselves. There are times I'm one of those people.

- Have a dark mode option! This would be especially helpful when trying to do reflections or any sort of exercises before bed, because it would be gentler on the eyes!

- Including “add notes” options for goals! This would be great for writing tips, affirmations, or even reminders such as “plan to increase goal after making progress”. 

- An option that goals can be set for “once this week”, “once this month”, etc, for the sort of habits users want to build slowly, and maybe aren’t ready to add to a strict schedule yet!

You earn energy for each goal completed, and goal reflection. A goal reflection is your self writing a reflection on what you just did. I recommend using this tool all the time because it has many benefits like the app analysing your mood throughout the day and letting out all your feelings.

You can also start journeys. There are all types of journeys for different things, I chose and am on building confidence and tidy space, tidy mind. This app really is just amazing.

It’s helped me feel better, and given me that self care I need. So please, download it would you? Aha. There’s way more stuff in this app other than what I have told you so far, discover that for yourself. I have something to say too.

This app is amazing and by far the best app I’ve had. There’s no stressful adds, and they don’t constantly try to sell you things.

This app is where your Finch friend and you get to grow mentally and emotionally. You can add fitness goals, and the offer stretching tutorials. Your Finch friend can meet other finches and you can meet other people. 
You don’t message those people word like, but you can send others simple things like water breaks, gratitude, to be calm, and thoughts.

Finch has all of those abilities and takes a lot of the mental load off of you. It prompts you to track your feelings. You can write your own goals, but it also has basic, pre-made goals that you can select without thinking them up/typing them in. Sometimes if you are feeling low enough, typing ‘brush teeth’ feels like it’s too much. But choosing it and seeing it on my list gives me the motivation to actually brush my teeth. 

That is what sets the app apart for me from all other mental wellness apps - it seems acutely aware of how difficult it can be to wake up in the morning, and it encourages you to take baby steps and still feel proud.

There is a free version and a paid version. The only difference is you get more things (new clothes for your birb friend, stuff to decorate their house, little animals friends) when you pay. But that’s it. And you still get things every day on the free version, so you don’t miss out on anything!!

There are about a million options for different tasks to focus on. And the little birb that is your friend?? The cutest! Dressing them up and their house and going on daily adventures is so fun. 

The thing I love most, though, is that there isn’t any downside to missing something. It doesn’t say “you’ll get it next time” or “Aw, you didn’t do X today.” It just moves forward. So if you’re having a rough week and can’t complete all your tasks, you don’t have anything making it worse. Or trying to make it better.

finch isn’t like them at all! you don’t get “punished” if you don’t check in. you get rewarded when you do! you can create your own goals in the free version, which i love.

That being said, I have a few suggestions that might add to Finch. If you’re looking for a specific clothing item, it can be really hard to find, since there are so many different colors and they’re all randomized. It’d be nice to be able to trade with other people that are in your Tree Town, or have a sort of wishlist system, so that the clothes you want are (at least a little) easier to get.

It’d also be cool to add pictures to your reflections. Sometimes instead of writing a whole paragraph I want to attach a picture that sums up that day.

Some of my favorite things about this app are: The adorable finch you get to name and watch grow, Tree Town (and the ability to add your friends as neighbors!), friends’ finches stopping by to say hi, the adorable items your finch can wear, and the variety of prompts you’re given.

The only negative experience I’ve had so far is the lag. No matter what, the animation and input always lags. On struggle days, this keeps me from interacting as much as I would like to.

some highlights of pros:
-user friendly
-Goals are customizable
-Soundscapes and focus timers super helpful
-you can customize reminders for goals repeated daily, weekly, which days, what time to be reminded etc. making it super helpful
-in-app helpline, grounding and self-soothing techniques, quizzes on mental health to encourage speaking to a professional

The facebook group kind of brought to light that the developers aren’t as great people as you’d think. They are so focused on mental health for all that they ignore concerns of members of marginalized communities. 
You would think since they created this big bride collection that they would stand by their LGBT users. 
Well you would be wrong. 
There was a post made by an admin/developer bringing up a specific incident, and myself and many others in the LGBT community felt uncomfortable by the way it was handled. When brought to their attention, along with possible solutions to the problem that would make both parties happy, they refused to budge. They are too focused on mental health for ALL to stand by the LGBT community and create a space that is safe for them. They don’t want to push people out, even if it is due to homophobia or transphobia (in their eyes as long as it hasn’t escalated to purely hateful discussion it’s important to have “nuanced discussions”).

When I set my goal on “every Monday”, i notice that it shows on Sunday as well. So I go back to my goals and I see that beside Monday, they automatically added “everyday”. And even if you try to delete that tag, it doesn’t let you.

Usually when I download apps like these I loose interest very quickly since I have high fixations. I get interested and use them a bunch, and then I forget about them within a few weeks. I’ve had this since February and I still use it.

This is really adorable and has improved so much since I’ve gotten it. I just feel better in general. The bird makes it so much better because now I also feel like if I ignore the app then Laine (my bird) will feel sad and I don’t want her to be sad. (Yes I know she’s not real and I don’t care.

however, i do have a few suggestions, which i have found a bit tedious in the app. the app should have something to make it easier to scroll down to the bottom, toward the first reflection entries. i've had the app for like a year now so it takes a while to get to the bottom. also there should be a way so that you can edit older reflections without being sent to the main home page after you're done, so you can edit older reflections and not have to scroll all the way back down. and i think there should be a way to edit reflections through categories too.

I like being able to feel like I have a little companion keeping an eye on me and making sure that I’m doing everything I can to guarantee that my day is going well, even if it’s just drinking water. 

When I see my little buddy go on an adventure it reminds me that everyday can be an adventure on our journey. This app is definitely a must for anybody who struggles to find value in otherwise monotonous activities. Despite not using this app daily I don’t feel pressured to participate and luckily have customized my character enough to enjoy seeing their cute little face whenever I do open it. 

The widget is very helpful.

This app is great !

What makes it unique : 
It interacts with you so much that it feels like a human is constantly encouraging you to do your works properly and guides you to proper meditation/anxiety relief routine . This game also lets you grow a pet and you can modify its behaviour based on what response you give when it asks a question due to curiously . 
What it’s lacking : 
Some things like 
* Duration of tasks 
* start time and end time of tasks 

Conclusion :
If the things in the asterisks get fullfiilled , then there won’t be any app which can compete with this in schedule making , mind relief and related things .

You got to dress up your pet and take them shopping. You also got to decorate their room. I could play that style of game for hours at a time because I find it so fun! This is almost like it only instead of games you journal and instead of sitting at a computer all day playing this you have to do tasks outside it. Then you take the stones you earned from staying on task and you can buy clothes and furniture. Maybe it’s easing my shopping addiction as well lol! 

I would love to see the option to dress up their critter companions. 
I also would love to see them make the amount of XP before an adventure go up as your finch gets older.

I was struggling so badly and really didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it through at times. While trying to get medical help, I found the free year of Balance offer somewhere and figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to try at that point, though I‚Äôd never really been a big believer in meditation.
 
I am so happy to admit how wrong I was- this app helped my emotional health so much before and after I got the additional help I needed.  The sleep modules in particular were so helpful- Ofosu‚Äôs voice alone is so calming and peaceful, and the meditations really help my mind stop wandering until it can relax and I can fall asleep. There are so many great non-sleep modules as well for different situations - it seems like there‚Äôs something there anytime I need it. Sometimes I go in knowing I will feel emotional, but sometimes it sneaks up on me in an unexpected and beautiful way too. I just purchased the lifetime plan- even though I don‚Äôt rely on this as a crutch like I used to, it has become something I want to do instead of something I have to do to get though the day.",5,False,This app helped me through the worst year of my life.,Calyne22,,Balance Meditation Sleep

I was already using another well-known app pretty regularly, but the set-up of this one is just perfect. You can choose to follow along with a plan or open the app up for a quick single meditation based on your specific need at the time. And the best part is, you can choose the duration of time that works specifically for you. Usually it‚Äôs 5 or 10 minutes but with some, they go down to 3 minutes or up to 15. I cannot say enough good things about this app. Thank you for being so kind and generous with your software during this wild time; it does not go unnoticed.

I would love to see more single meditations added on a regular basis, or different variations of the same ones. For instance, with the concentrate meditation, I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt include visualization. On that note, I would LOVE to see an entire guided plan for visualization practice/learning how to visualize. It would be cool if there was a log to see which meditations you did on which days.

This app worked for me because it started off with short sessions and easy skills and builds from there.  I now find myself wanting to do the longer sessions.  I love that this program builds on the success of each session and gives you multiple techniques for your meditation toolkit.

In the past seven years, I‚Äôve been taking on the problems of those who can‚Äôt seem to handle their own, and I have been neglecting myself in the worst way.

So I figured meditating would just increase my anxiety and make me more restless so I made up facts about it to myself and never tried. The barrier to entry is always what makes trying new things hard but for mediation Balance was a seamless and relaxingly simple experience.

My one recommendation to the app designer is to make the meditation intros optional. Please include a SKIP button. There are three or more questions you are required to answer before the meditation even begins and it‚Äôs super annoying.

Reasons I love it:
‚Ä¢ The Design: Hats off to the designers and developers, you guys did a fabulous job of making a pretty, minimalist, and not-distracting app (which are my favorite qualities in an app). 
‚Ä¢ Customization: From the first moment in the app, you begin creating a custom program based on your needs (stress management, focus etc), and from there you can even choose the voice of your Guide. You are also able to choose the length of meditation you wish to complete, so whether you‚Äôre overwhelmed by the idea of sitting still for 10 minutes or just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time‚Äù you can always fit it in. 
‚Ä¢ Content: The techniques used in the program I am following feel far more effective in capturing my attention than other apps I‚Äôve tried. I feels like a it clicking more this time. There are also lots of to choose from when you are in need of something specific.

The worst part is that even some of the basics they took the time to explain were explained poorly, so it wastes time for experienced users but I'm not sure how you would understand if you were inexperienced. I've been meditating for several years and this app spent several minutes talking about how my mind was like an empty garden when I first started using it, and how setting intentions is like planting seeds??

Balance is unique among meditation apps (in my experience) because meditations vary according to goals you identify at the beginning & your feedback on how you feel about your progress or lack thereof daily. At the halfway point in meditation plans, a few simple questions assess how well you're retaining the material you've covered then adjusts your path going forward. This all results in a richer, more unique meditation experience. 

My favorite feature though has to be the Immersive Meditations. These utilize your device‚Äôs haptics to engage your sense of touch and motion to deepen your experience. I haven't come across that in any other app like this.

- more unguided sessions. Maybe a prompt in the beginning and then silence. (There is one unguided option at this point.) A lot of the time there is just too much talking, and while the info is useful, it can be distracting and even annoying. (Could be just me.) I need more time to sit in silence.

1. It‚Äôs incredibly simple and straightforward. The plans give you a recommended practice for your day but if you want to do a single it lets you pick by subject. This is great because I often jump to the app for a specific subject to meditate on. 

2. Aside from choosing from 2 voices, it allows you to change the length of the practice. This varies from 3 mins to sometimes 30.

I have (had) no background in meditation and honestly not any interest taking it up. In fact, early on I suggested they might add something that suggests why I would want to meditate in the first place. But, they asked for my help so I tried to give it.

I never really got invested in meditation while doing this daily, but interestingly I did notice many of the techniques were quite helpful and over time I did find myself thinking about and sometimes using them outside the app. 

So...if meditation is your thing I think you‚Äôll find it fantastic. If meditation is not? Give it a try anyways for 21 days then decide. There are handy things that help you calm yourself when you want to lash out at someone, among other things.

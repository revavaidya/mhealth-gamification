We are currently long distance and looking for ways to continue being intimate with each other despite the distance. I feel like we are already really open and honest with each other but this app has taken it to another level. It’s helps facilitate conversations that we haven’t thought of or convos that we may be unsure of how to bring up. I love that our answers to the “question sets” are locked until we both answer so that we aren’t biased by what the other person’s response is. It may seem like a lot to spend $70 for the year for it but man it’s so worth it. Just look at it like a date night, dinner+drinks and a tip and this app is for the whole year. Go with the year subscription (it’s cheaper than the monthly) and really just explore this app with your partner. We’re learning new things about each other and our relationship and I am loving it. I also love this app because when I’m using it I feel like those who created the app are really passionate about what they’re doing here. I feel like I would want to be apart of the company, I just love this product.  The concept and execution are a dream, so I get why they charge what they do. It’s worth the money.  We briefly tried another app, but it almost felt like it was created and no one went back to continue making it better. This is the real deal, and can be a great asset to your relationship.

2022-07-23 16:26:47,,"My partner of 3 months and I are both transgender, nonbinary, bisexual, and polyamorous, so we were worried that an app like this wouldn’t include our experiences. We were pleasantly surprised from day 1! I love all the little images for the questions throughout the app, they will be like abstract kissing heart faces, or two marshmallows, or two origami boats- very cute and genderless! There are question packs that deal directly with queerness such as the “pronouns pack” and many of the descriptions talking about the research for why the questions are important talk about lgbtq+ relationships. There is even one “tip/exercise” called “metamour agreements” which was a pleasant surprise as a polyamorous couple. Overall, we have really enjoyed the app, it’s fun and has definitely helped us learn about eachother and become closer, even as a new couple. 

A few suggestions to be even more inclusive- I would love to see even more about polyamory, especially catered towards already very open and non-hierarchical structures (not just written for primary partners considering opening up). I’d also love to see something about caretaking dynamics in the case where one partner has a disability. 

Also for the games, it would be cool to be able to see all 4 answer choices again once the results are in. Right now you can only see whatever answers you each picked but it would sometimes be fun to remember what you had to choose from.",5,False,Queer Friendly!,MxOnyx,Paired Couples Relationship

We are currently living paycheck to paycheck, so we couldn’t dish out $60 right then and there, BUT we were willing to pay each month, until we saw there wasn’t an option to do so…:(  If you guys ever do decide to add a monthly payment option, we would subscribe in a heartbeat!! I also think it would possibly help other people who may be in a similar situation as us, if that option was added! Only one thing that we were kinda upset about was that we answered soooo many activities (the open ended questions, specifically) right before our free trial ended, and as soon as it did, we couldn’t read/access ANY of each others answers that we hadn’t gotten a chance to read yet, which really sucked because we spent HOURSSS on this app answering them for each other, and were looking forward to seeing each others answers:( Other than that, this app is absolutely AMAZING!

Well you can’t be a 5 expecting a 10 to want you. 10’s attract 10’s. So focus on being the best you that you can be, and upon doing so, you will see the stars align for you. This is by far one of the better apps out there that is truly worth paying for. You really do get out of it what you put into it and i think that if you both can be truthfully honest, as well as brutally honest, it will truly bring the two of you together. It gives you an opportunity to really get into your significant others head, which lesssss be honest, you wouldn’t have been able to do so otherwise because 9/10 couples are afraid of being honest with each other, let alone being “brutally” honest. So; if you’re looking for a review that says “this app is worth every penny and you should totally download it!” well then you have my vote! Good luck to those looking to better their relationship and not give up on something just because it’s hard!

There’s nothing wrong with the app persay. The premise is great and the results speak for themselves. It’s a fun little thing to do everyday with the significant other if nothing else. My main issues are 1, there’s no feedback option or link to report a bug. It’s just bad business in my opinion to assume your app is perfect and your users will never need to report anything. 2, the bug I was trying to report which made me realize the above point in the first place was that when one of us changes our photo, it doesn’t reflect on the others’ app. My boyfriend added a photo of himself and I can’t see it on my end. He can see mine and the cover photo, which is odd. 3, you know I’m gonna whine and moan about the subscription based pricing. It’s such a scam to pay per month when you used to be able to just buy the premium version of apps for like 5 bucks and that was the end of it. That’s it. If you add a “report a bug” button and fix the photo bug, I would definitely think it’s worth 4 stars at least.

I think the questions are engaging, some more so than others (often the quizzes are a low-point for me), but in general I am a fan of the app.

This is where the title of my review comes in. I am asexual (a sexuality in which a person experiences little to no sexual attraction towards anyone). I do not have sexual attraction to my partner, and I neither want to have sex, or do have sex with him. This has lead to many an awkward situation for us.

He will give a whole paragraph about sexual attraction and his feelings and my answers will be “i do not experience sexual attraction”. Questions regarding our sex life are dull and simply go no where. If anything they’re awkward. If I could change anything, I would recommend making it do couples could choose if they are interested in having questions regarding sex or not. It would allow for people like me, to not only feel more represented and respected, but also make for a better app in my opinion. People don’t have sex lives for more than just asexuality, and if they are uncomfortable by it, they should have the option to avoid it.",4,False,Sexuality and Paired’s Questions,eembezzle,Paired Couples Relationship

Half of the activities that we had to answer had nothing to do with either one of us individually or together as a couple.

A ‘sort by’ feature so discussions or answers that haven’t been read yet is a must in my opinion. Also, at times, when the little red heart shows up on a title signifying something has been added to the conversation, it doesn’t always seem to open to something new. Often it’s something I’ve already seen. Trying to find the new information becomes a sisyphean task.

We’ve talked so much about these topics already when we began dating but it’s fun to rethink some of these questions and re-realize or see how the answer has changed now or merged together. 

It actually eases my mind personally too because I get something in my head and then I worry. 
Re-understanding some things, or being more clear about his perspectives with this app makes me see how far we already came and the scale is not tipping into terrible doom, but in fact we’re doing 80% well and only 20% arguing.

The recently updated format to see what has been answered to catch up and the side bar to chat on each topic is much improved and really intuitive.  

Very few questions have not been relevant to our situation, the couple that are not pertaining to our demographic or lifestyle can be skipped over, or we answer for fun and shock value (at our own peril I might add) 

I’m unable to see the group of questions that I answer once we’ve both selected for each partner when we do a challenge/winner game, I can  only presently see the single answer given, it makes it hard to recall the choices offered if that makes any sense (“all of the above” doesn’t really tell me what that was referring to, for example when asking me “Never have you ever —- “

This app is a great way to bring up conversations that you may have had a difficult time starting on your own!

Cons:
App does have some bugs, but they are actively working on them and in the past 8 months I have seen great improvement in reliability (Dec 2022- May2023)
There are some questions that come up that are basically just reworded from previous months.  Can’t say I expect better because there are only so many questions you can answer.

How can that be true at all when as soon as I paired with my partner, all of the old “data and progress” just so happened to pop up. 

So, I guess that data doesn’t really get lost and IS in fact restored as soon as you pair with a part er that is really interested in wanting to grow. All the progress that was entered in that was based on an old version of myself and is not even fair for someone that has grown so much individually to be reminded of where they were before.

1. Notifications always only ever take you to the main page of the app. Even if the notification was telling you about a new quiz or that your partner answered a question. Always the Home Screen. So you will often lose what you’re looking for. 

2. Some of the quizzes simply don’t apply to us, and I wish there was a way to dismiss them. For example, neither my wife nor I fall are LGBTQ+.

They are obviously secularists who couldn’t imagine anyone else with different values living in the world using their app. Some times your mind gets blocked in answers and so the “example responses” are supposed to kick start your creativity. The problem is  many times their “example responses” could only apply to sexual libertines and moral relativists. Even in their questions they sometimes push sexual ethics and boundaries to inappropriate places. Their questions suffer from the same myopic vision. Sometimes their questions only make sense to people steeped in their post-modern secular western value system. Could Amish even understand these questions? How about English speaking Africans, Catholic South Americans, Religious African Americans, English speaking Muslims, English speaking Hindi, Confucian Chinese? Nope most of these questions and answers are framed around white science worshiping secularists and their value system. As an example, “ Where do you see yourself relationally in Five years?” Example response: “Still in our Non-monogamous relationships but we have told our families.” Is this seriously what 90% of married couples want to have celebrated in 5 years?

2022-07-27 12:53:36,,"We have been using for a month and overall, the app is pretty good. But, I think there are a few key areas that if modified would majorly improve the app and user experience/benefit—especially for a paid service and continued subscription.
1) the app should personalize/filter the content pushed to its users so it’s relevant to them .This could be accomplished in the initial couple profile creation and questionnaire. ex. If I am married to a man and we are both straight, content related to the queer experience isn’t relevant or helpful to improving our relationship, whereas it could be helpful to others who fit that criteria. There are areas in the app that do only apply to those dating vs those who are married, divorced etc., and those with kids or without and contemplating having them.
2) I thought the chat function as it is currently setup would be more helpful than it is. The app would benefit from having a separate notifications section so one partner is notified when the other completes a questionnaire, quiz, etc. I think it would be more helpful if the couples could “chat” within each actual questionnaire, open ended question, quiz once completed. The reactions function in the open ended questions is nice, but would be much better if you could also enter comments, follow-up questions etc. to your partner as well. This provides an opportunity for a conversation to be started between the couple after reviewing answers. Unless you and your partner are physically sitting next to each other when completing and reviewing these things (which the majority of the time is not the case we have found), I think the benefit is reduced without that “next step”.",4,False,Overall Good - But Improvements Needed!,PennyGirl87,Paired Couples Relationship

Me and my lover had fun and learned a lot about each other. I think we grew more comfortable with ourselves in the process :) Sadly, those few months weren’t meant to last.

Some updates introducing new questions to the game started to become unanswerable. They would indicate that I was supposed to be with my partner IRL for me to answer it, otherwise it would just be pure speculation. For example, (in simpler terms), “how DO you both manage work around the house?” There were multiple flaws within this question; one of which being that we are long distance and this is something we have no experience with. So, we started to guess. We would basically form an idea of what would happen if we DID live together.. so we wouldn’t lose our streak and so we would fill our unspoken quota of answering at least one question on the app per day. 

This worked for a while, especially with the release of ‘games’ which made my partner intrigued on a whole new level! However, things gradually got worse. There came a point where answering the questions seemed pointless because they became irrelevant to us. We had no way of knowing the answer and, since we don’t live near or with each other, it was always guessing. I checked the questions every day for about a month (whereas my partner had given up about 2 weeks into this) and we collectively decided to give up. The app had become useless to us now and ultimately not fun and a waste of time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a good app!

It’s only 1 question a day, which, I feel is inadequate. I feel if the app had way more quality questions, this could be a great tool. However, we’ve been using it for a few weeks now and maybe 3 questions actually sparked an actual conversation surrounding the question. Everything else has been incredibly LAME. For instance, today’s question was: “How much do you think couples vacations should cost?”  What on earth is that supposed to accomplish in a marriage? No vacation *should* be only a set amount. It depends on the experience you are looking for. But my biggest annoyance is, these kinds of questions don’t feel  they are useful for us. How is discussing how much we think a vacation should cost going to spark a deep, thoughtful conversation?  Yesterday’s question was: “When was the last time your partners family or friends helped you out?” Why is this relevant? It would be nice to get more personal, in depth questions that are specific to a relationship and not a bunch of hypotheticals for life and other people in general.  The quizzes (the only 2 we’ve gotten) are also boring. 

Basically this app is good for couples who want to keep life vanilla or to avoid connecting on a deeper level but makes you think you are just because you’re answering these questions.

1. questions (especially the questions in the monthly quiz) should be paired with the length of time a couple has been dating. the app asks for your special dates, like an anniversary. i’m sure there’s a way the developers can work with the practitioners who create the questions to use a couple’s relationship timeline so the questions asked more appropriately align with where they’re at in their relationship.
2. in quizzes and games, there should be an option to fill in the blank. i understand it would be hard to score, but im sure there’s a way to figure out how to make it work. because there are some questions that literally do not apply to us and make no sense to our relationship and/or who we are as people. for example, the emoji game where you have to choose which emoji relates more to one person vs the other, would be a perfect game to implement the “fill in your own response” option because some of those emojis were ones we’ve never used or don’t apply to us at all.
 
the app is great, these are just a couple of suggestions that i think would really make the app improve dramatically…especially having questions that align with the timeline of our relationship. maybe even having its own separate section?

All in all, it’s a great app that’s super engaging and has brought a lot of laughs and insight to my relationship. I guess I just wish that some of the answer choices for some of the games were more relatable. I mean.. who wrote this stuff? For example, a question could be something like… “what is your ideal date night?” And the answer choices might be something along the lines of:
a.) dinner & a movie 
b.) meeting the parents
c.) a play at your favorite local theatre 
d.) a long walk down the city sidewalk 
But it’s like.. uhhhh.. WHO WATCHES PLAYS?? Not all of us live near the city either… so you’re basically left with one forced generic option to choose from. Lol it’s either the answers are so generic and boring or they’re completely unreliable or unrealistic. 

The only other thing that I wish was different was if you complete or answer an activity and are waiting for your partner to complete/answer the same one, it shows up in a list. This is okay. But I wish that when your partner did the task too that it notified you rather than just remaining in the list. Sometimes it’s just difficult to keep track of when there is SO many items in the list.. you don’t know which ones to go back and look at their answers. Maybe a little banner/notification on the task that says something like “partner answered question pack or quiz” would make it a lot easier.

2021-06-15 13:01:11,,"I don’t usually write reviews. I think total I might have like 3-4 reviews on this thing but this one I had to write. 

I see there are people talking about issues with the app such as results not being loaded up. For that one all you have to do is close the app and restart it for me I haven’t had any of those issues except for once and I found out it was cause I had. an internet outage in my area at the time I was doing a quiz, but all is well.

For people complaining about paying a subscription for premium you obviously don’t realize what your getting for that price and your don’t have to choose monthly. Why pay 14.99 per month when you can pay 59.99 per year? I use this app every single day to answer quizzes with my partner and we use this app to talk about our relationship when I’m at work. It’s a great tool to use to track all the issues or non issues in our relationship if I want to discuss something more in depth in our relationship I can go to the app and I have all the answers from previously asked questions all right there.

This app is priceless (even though there is a price) but I look at it as investing in my relationship I don’t care about a 60 bucks a year payment when it’s $60 towards my relationship this app have quizzes, experts that have advice and it’s broken down by specific categories ranging from finances, intimacy, fun/excitement, and many other topics. If you can’t afford $60 bucks don’t break your bank, but if you can then I say it’s well worth it. Also there’s a 7 day free trial to gauge whether you want to continue with a subscription or not and after 3 days me and my partner knew we were buying it we even took 2 extra days to make sure, or we would have canceled the subscription. Like I said before this app is priceless (even though it has a price)

If you wanna buy activity books, make questions yourself, or whatever for you and your spouse to use. That’s fine but that’s not all this app has to offer they have activities, quizzes, but also there are articles and above from relationship experts for you to read over, and all that for $60 bucks a year or try out the 7 day free trial.

Thank you for your time.

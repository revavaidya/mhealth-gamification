Nothing changes over night, but I have been looking this stuff up and reading into it for a while. Positive affirmations can change the way you think. Even if you think you can‚Äôt, just continue reading them and hearing them for a month . Watch how your life can change. We all should strive to be more positive human beings. I know it can be hard, especially since I come from a very abusive and violent back ground. You can change your negative thinking habits. I challenge you to trying positive affirmations for a month and to also be monitoring your thoughts...also called mental chatter. Try to calm your mind and always be in the present moment , and if you‚Äôre going to have thoughts. Do your best to always make them positive. Positive affirmations is one of the ways to help with this. I also learn from our teacher Jesus Christ. A lot to learn from the good Book. The Holy Bible. Guys try it and see. I wish everyone to find their purpose in life and to be more loving and show more compassion towards one another. May God bless you all.

2022-02-15 03:50:40,,"I‚Äôve tried several mood tracking apps over the years. I feel like they help in the beginning to identify what is happening, but over time it just felt like a regular reminder that I was down and at a certain point that stops being helpful. I‚Äôm not severely depressed  - just another person struggling with the roller coaster of life over the last few years. We own a stressful business, separated from my wife, then later found out I had cancer. Therapy helps a bunch, but when my therapist took a break for maternity leave I was on my own and needed some help. 

I decided to try this app instead of another mood tracker, and I am so glad I did. I can customize the categories of affirmations I receive and how often they pop up. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how helpful it is to have some positive words show up on my Apple Watch just when I needed it. If I had one suggestion for the developers it would be to create a category specific to cancer patients. Most of the messages are great, but having incurable cancer means my health is literally failing so messages that remind me that I should be grateful for my health are not negative, but also not necessarily helpful.

For example, someone who wants to lose weight can add a picture of what they looked like a year ago and get daily motivation reminders to go to the gym or quotes or whatever it may be to keep them motivated. Another Example can be saving up for let's say a car a picture of the car and daily reminders to never give up on your goal of saving up for that car.

This is a simple concept, brilliantly executed.  You receive affirmations pushed to your device.  You get to decide what topics you want to focus on, and there were way more topics than I imagined.  Truly something for everyone!  You also decide how often you receive the affirmations and can design widgets and watch faces as well - all customizable with many lovely backgrounds and fonts. 

Most important though are the affirmations and their health benefits.  Some of the things we struggle with require a major mind shift.  Getting positive reminders throughout the day helps shift negative patterns and helps build new mental habits.

‚Äî widgets.

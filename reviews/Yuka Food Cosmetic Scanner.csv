2022-08-24 14:01:06,"I discovered this app on Tiktok about a week ago and I’m blown away by how much I have learned already. It is so so so helpful for my health journey to be able to see all the ingredients in my diet. People always say not to eat anything with ingredients you can’t pronounce, but who actually has the time to look up all these scary ingredients? This app is doing the work for you and making it a CONVENIENT way to make more conscious choices while grocery shopping. The blurbs of information regarding why an ingredient is bad or good is very easy to understand (in my opinion) and it is giving me a lot to think about in my life. I don’t want to put these things into my body, especially if they can build up and cause problems to me later in life. It’s shocking to see what kinds of things are being absorbed into my body. Packaging and marketing of products can be VERY misleading and I’m glad I have the science in this app to help me when all the choices of products may be misleading me. 
One thing to note is that it is very important to be reading WHY the products are bad, because Yuka is not only looking at the harmful things but also taking into account nutrition. I don’t mind eating something that’s way too fatty for me (in moderation) as long as it doesn’t have anything harmful :).",5,False,So helpful with mindfulness!,rach212000,,Yuka Food Cosmetic Scanner
2022-07-26 19:55:02,"I think everyone should have this app. It makes it so much easier to read between the lines of all ingredients. Especially beauty products. I am a scientist and half the time I don’t even know what some of these ingredients are. When it comes to food, I think it is very eye opening to see that just because something is labeled as organic, non gmo, blah, blah… it doesn’t always have the best ingredients. Now to my complain. I don’t buy anything with corn syrup or added sugars. This i already know by heart after going for clean only foods about 10 years ago. However, for someone who is just starting to navigate this confusing world of food, it may be misleading to read that ice cream is rated as poor. Now, hear me out. This was my husband’s thinking when we scanned an ice cream brand at Sprouts. The rating was poor. It said it had high fat and high sugar. According to my husband, ice cream should be fatty and sugary. Can’t argue with that if we are talking about a standard ice cream recipe. In his eyes, there was nothing wrong with the ice cream. The app fails to indicate that the brand contains corn syrup. I think it should be broken down better. The rating is poor because it has high sugar content, but not just any sugar. It has corn syrup. I feel the developers should work more into explaining why a high sugar rating deems a product poor. Not everyone is well versed with the dangers of sugars, real or fake.",4,False,Amazing!

This app makes it so easy to break down whats in a product so easily. ive shown everyone i know and even paid for the premium version. (this app is consumer funded. company's do not pay them to say their product is this or that) me being superstitious compared what the app said to what the label of ingredients said and its always right. 
i know the app is still fairly new and the interface and features it offers outside of just listing ingredients and letting you know if there bad then offering recommendations it doesn't do a whole lot more. I like that it keeps of history of barcode scans, i wish it had a feature to incorporate online shopping. Me personally i dont shop alot in stores and without a physical barcode it makes buying things online still risky. so that could be a cool feature.

2022-11-11 15:13:41,"Some apps are fun, many are useful, and a very few are life-changing. Yuka is one of the latter. I initially used it to scan my previously purchased foods and hygiene/cosmetic products, and now I use it every time I shop. I even became a Premium member in order to look up products I can’t scan (like when I’m shopping online). I have very sensitive skin and have often dealt with contact dermatitis, burning, itching, and other adverse reactions. Being able to find and switch to products that don’t contain potential allergens or harmful chemicals has given me peace of mind and much happier skin. I also like to eat as cleanly as I can, and Yuka facilitates that. It’s a lot easier to simply not buy a food at the store when it’s rated poor or bad, and, if I decide to buy it anyway, it’s a no-brainer to eat it sparingly. It’s amazing and disheartening how many processed foods that claim to be super healthy actually aren’t healthy at all. Needless to say, Yuka has saved me from being deceived and wasting money. In a world full of vendors whose bottom line is financial gain rather than creating and selling safe, effective products, Yuka is an enormous blessing.

I showed her this app, and that many products she thought were healthy were actually contributing to gaining weight, migranes, and even more conditions.

I  personally love how you get recommendations on similar products that are healthier alternatives. Not only that but I feel much better knowing that what I am going to eat In the future is healthy, and tasty. 
 Some ideas I have for this app are ones that will make it easier to purchase items, for example… let’s say a cereal brand you have been buying products from is not healthy, and you tap on a similar, but healthier alternative, it would make it very convenient if you could tap it and add it to a personalized in app grocery list, for when you go to the store.

It seems and is like the best app ever made because it’s saving us from harmful chemicals, like parabens, sulfates, artificial sweeteners, texturizers, food dyes and soooo much more that is harmful to ingest.
When I shop at the local wholefoods, I find MANY products within that store harmful and not everything is perfectly clean there to buy. I share it with people in the store as I’m shopping and with the cashiers. It blows their mind! But then, I see them go straight to their phone and look for it to get it. I usually show people how it works on the spot. These are just strangers and I am telling everybody about it. When I’m at work, and people are eating microwave foods, and what not, scanning those products is all bad and hazardous to eat.

Sometimes, items will say they contain harmful materials, but READ THE DESCRIPTION! I have found, with my own scans, sometimes the harmful ingredient is only harmful in certain situations, and the product I scanned DOES NOT fall in that category. So the descriptions of these ingredients is, in a sense, a copy/paste, but not in a bad way. This actually means they research and review ingredients, not products.
Also, as a personal side note, it is NOT an American website/app, which gives it more credibility, to me. I can’t trust these processed-loving Americans….

The Problems:  the biggest problem is that it does not focus on ingredients, only the nutrition label. Does not even give you a picture or a list if the ingredients, not even for the alternative recommendations. Friends, Ingredients Matter!  Ingredients are the first thing we should know about the food, before the calories, grams of sugar, amount of protein and fats. You can’t just read the amount of protein on a product label and know what you’re putting in your body. Not all ingredients are created the same, so the type of sugar matters, the type of fats matter, the quality of these ingredients matter, and how the body processes and uses the nutrients.  This app will point out that there is too much sugar in a item, then go on to recommend a food with artificial sugar, which is so incredibly damaging to your health.  It will recommend food with highly processed/refined oils, and foods high in glyphosate (which you can’t even read on an ingredient list) you just have to know what foods are heavily sprayed with chemicals, which is why people need good advice from apps like this, not more bad choices to replace the already bad choices.",1,False,Does not focus on ingredients and poor alternatives,tiapink13,"{'id': 33561804, 'body': 'Hello, thank you for your feedback!

Most foods can be part of a healthy and well rounded diet, even if they are fatty or sugary. It’s ok to have a treat sometimes as long as it’s not your main source of sustenance. Instead of learning Yuma’s value judgement on the item, I just want to check to make sure there are no additives and chemicals in these products.

For example, for skincare products, they base it on high concentration levels of the ingredients even though skincare products are legally not allowed to sell products with such high amounts of ingredients that can be toxic in high level consumption. To make that ingredient not toxic, brands only allow small amounts to make it safe for human consumption. This app doesn’t consider the exposure (the concentration of the ingredient). Many products are considered hazardous but are still safe to use. Thats because they’re only hazardous/harmful if used in high concentration, which are never used in cosmetics.

But I don’t agree with the rating system. The ratings take a “one size fits all” approach, which limits their usefulness.  Anything it deems too high in sugar, fat, or salt is flagged as “bad”.  For example, it flagged a liquid aminos product I’ve used for years as “bad” because it’s too high in salt.  But I’ve never had high blood pressure, so salt is not a problem for me.  I also think some fat is necessary in one’s diet.  If I were to follow the app’s advice, I’d only eat vegetables and little else.

However, I’m a vegetarian with IBS, so I watch my FODMAP intake.  I didn’t see this information anywhere in the app.

My point is that people are different, so a blanket approach doesn’t work for everyone.

Also, a product like Himalayan Pink salt, which is rich in minerals, has a very different effect on the body than ordinary table salt.  I tried to add it, but the only 2 salt categories were “table salt” and “sea salt” and this is neither.  So I gave up.

All items I’ve found on the app have the correct ingredients for the product. You buy the expensive product because it has retinol or peptides and don’t question all the other ingredients. Aside from the beauty supplies, this app has changed the way I grocery shop. When I think of a food I might want to buy in the future, I first look it up on the Yuka app and determine if I should make a different choice in food or brand! I looked up raspberry jam today and found two products with an Excellent rating and then added one to my future shopping list. Yuka helps me buy smarter.

The only downside is that features are still being built out since it’s user funded and in on-going development stages. 

I recommend that we can categorize our favorites! I’d like to separate beauty products from food products and even fruits from vegetables from snacks. This way when I go in my favorites, it’s easier to quickly navigate and find what I’m looking for.

It is very revealing to find the number of hazardous elements that are allowed in, not only our cosmetics, but in our food! I was appalled. But Yuka gives us quite a variety of healthy and safe alternatives to replace the items that we threw away. Now we are familiar with the healthy brands and can build a relationship with them. 

I never would have know that certain additives were harmful, even banned by other countries, that are allowed in the products we use in the U.S. So you will not regret downloading this App. All you have to do is scan the barcode on makeup, soap, and foods of every kind to find out if they score Bad-Poor-Good or Excellent. 

On a humorous note, my son scanned my bottle of Jack Daniels whisky and Yuka’s response was, “We do not rate alcohol. But you know what you’re doing.”  We laughed about that for an hour!

For example, a snack that consists of whole foods containing no additives will be considered “bad” simply because it has 200 calories… when 200 calories as a snack is the ideal amount for a healthy individual. We should not be demonizing foods because of their calorie count when we know it’s one’s total calorie intake for the day that matters in regards to their health and weight. 

I would hate to see people, specifically younger kids, get the wrong idea and start to consider foods bad if they have 200 calories, when those 200 calories have vital nutrients and are made of healthy ingredients.

The potential risks associated with each ingredient, along with their scientific sources, are displayed in the app.\n\nThe ingredients are classified into 4 categories of risk:\n- no risk (green dot)\n- low risk (yellow dot)\n- moderate risk (orange dot)\n- high risk (red dot)\n\nThe score depends on the level of the ingredient with the highest risk that is present in the product. In this way, if a high-risk ingredient (red) is present in the product, the rating will automatically be at the red level (below 25/100). If the ingredient with the highest level of risk is a moderate risk-ingredient (orange), the product rating will then be mediocre (below 50/100). \n\nThe presence of other ingredients will then determine the exact score within the defined range.\n\nConcerning your feedback on the ingredient ""Fragrance/Parfum"", we\'re currently reviewing the rating for this ingredient for the US market, assessing the legislation and scientific studies published on the health impact of this ingredient.\n\nI hope to have answered your questions, if not, feel free to write to us at team@yuka.io.\n\nHave a very nice day.\nValentin.', 'modified': '2022-11-30T15:12:39Z'}",Yuka Food Cosmetic Scanner

However, the carcinogenic nature of this substance has only been proven when it contains so-called asbestiform fibers (similar to those of asbestos). The IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) has classified talc not containing these asbestiform fibers in the category of substances whose carcinogenicity could not be proven (category 3).\n\nHowever, precautions for its use are generally recommended.

The nutritional quality is attributed a possible 60% of the score. The calculation method is based on the recommendations of Professor Serge Hercberg within the framework of the French National Health Strategy proposed by the State and validated through the implementation of the Nutri-Score. This method takes into account the following nutritional criteria: calories, sugar, salt, saturated fats, protein, fiber, fruits and vegetables.\n\n2. Additives represent 30% of the product score. We base this on numerous sources conducted to study the harmful effects of food additives.\n\nOur framework for the analysis of additives is based on current scientific research. We take the following into account:\n\nThe scientific opinions of official bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\nAll of the independent scientific studies on the subject.\n\n\n3.

I have learned so much about the products I use daily and will start making some changes, since I learned the ones I was able to find are absolutely horrible for me. From food to cosmetic products!! I Love that you can pick how much you are able to pay for the yearly membership! I do wish there was links for the recommended alternatives of where you can buy them. But I realize that would most likely interfere with the whole independent recommendations aspect of it. 
My only complaint is, once I paid for the membership and started looking up products, I noticed there are mostly French and German food products. From places like Lidl and Aldi. I assume the creator is most likely French or German, but here in the states, not a lot of places have Aldi or Lidl. I WISH where I live in Colorado, we did. I miss those stores from being born and raised for 18 years in Germany. But most of my food products are from Walmart, Safeway and King Soopers. I haven’t found any store brands from either of those places, so most of my grocery purchases I wasn’t able to look up and learn about. Also a lot of the recommendations I’m not able to find in stores because they are not in said grocery stores where I live, but other stores like Aldi and Lidl. I hope one day the more generic store brands will be added, that would make me use the app on every single item! It would be awesome if there was a place to suggest products to the developer, so they can be added. But every other aspect of this app is amazing. I’m so grateful my husband showed me and I have recommended it to everyone from family to friends! Don’t let my store brand item critique persuade you to not get the app, this app is AMAZING.

2022-12-12 16:35:39,"I freaking love this app! It has turned shopping for me into something that is full of anxiety and uncertainty into an enjoyable experience where I can be sure I trust the products I am buying and using. There are so many products that look “organic” and “healthy” for people but when I would go to read the ingredients it’s like… “how do I even pronounce that word? What even is that? I don’t know” and would blindly be buying things or left looking up each ingredient in the isle on my phone and being confused and wasting so much time with my partner getting frustrated at how much time I’m taking up in the store. 

With this app you can scan items bar codes and it will list out the ingredients and why they might be bad or good. What they’re commonly used for and the risk factors. I absolutely love scanning items and being able to see what is good and what is so so bad. 

The only downside to this app is that it is disappointing to scan a product and see that it’s so bad for you but it makes me feel so good to know I know what I’m putting into and on my body. The best part of the app is that it’s turned shopping into a little game where I have my phone out and can scan everything and not waste any time worrying about whether or not I’m making the right choice. I’m happy and healthy and my partner is a lot happier with the amount of time we spend in the store. :) I look forward to using this app when I can and the more I use it, the more I know which products I can trust and which I can’t. :)",5,False,Life changing!!,stories94,,Yuka Food Cosmetic Scanner
